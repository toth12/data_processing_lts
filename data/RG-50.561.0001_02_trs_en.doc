}{\plain In Wittelshofen, Heinrich Von Wittelshofen.  Town named in 1275.  Mostly Protestant town.  
People suffered from castle owner\'96robbed, etc...  Town was named after Caste, built in 1275.  In 
1380, castle changed hands.  Again several times.  Farmers gave most to owner and complained.  
People revolted after a change in 1520 and burned down the castle.  Farmers lost the battle and 
the castle was rebuilt by the farmers under force.  Better than ever.  Man made canal around the 
castle.  35 rooms, some very big for meetings and festivals.  Large storeroom/warehouse is still 
there today (barns?)  In debt and sold to Schlossheimer (cousin of Flora Winter\'92s grandmother) 
and Monheimer (grandmother of Flora Winter on her father\'92s side).  Jews could not own land 
before.  On 5/15/1856 the castle was burned by lightening.  Built four family houses on the 
grounds with the insurance money.  Still stone fence around and cellar exists.  Flora Frank\'92s 
grandparents owned the garden but sold four of the 5 houses.  They had the cellar as a basement.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Tape\'97\par
}{\plain Wittelshofen is near Dinkelsbuhl and Buttenwiesen is near Augsburg.  Augsburg is about an hour 
and a half away from Munich.  Neither near any borders.  \par
}{\plain SF: Could you describe Wittelshofen.\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  It was a very clean, small town about 700-1000 people living there and out of the 700, 
695 were Nazis.  \par
}{\plain SF:  What did the town look like. \par
}{\plain FF: Lots of streets.  There was one main street and otherwise lots of side streets in all directions.  
They were old houses and they were very good brick houses, most of them, and they all had 
flowers outside on the windowsills.  Usually geraniums-white and red-it really was very clean.  
They were small shops.  They were nothing big.  We usually went to Dinkelsbuhl or to N\'fcrnberg 
for shopping.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever describe Buttenwiesen.\par
}{\plain FF: It was a bigger town than Wittelshofen and it was a nicer town.  In the people it seems.  They 
were very helpful people.  In Wittelshofen they were about 8 Jewish families to my time and the 
others were all Protestants and no Catholic could ever come...  Buttenwiesen was half Protestant 
and half Catholic so that was a more...  They had more than a thousand people there.  \par
}{\plain SF: Is Buttenwiesen where they first made Budweiser beer?  (Note: Later learned that Budweiser 
was first made in Budweis=Ceske Budjevoice, Czech Republic)\par
}{\plain FF: I wouldn\'92t know.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did the schul in Wittelshofen look like?\par
}{\plain FF: It was a big temple.  Oh, that temple was hundreds of years old.  I even have a picture of it.  I 
don\'92t know where it is now, but I have a picture of it.  It was a big temple and it was really nice.  
Then everybody moved away and then there was the big temple and nobody to go in.  They 
didn\'92t have stained glass windows, they had plain windows but they were like, you know, in 
broken glass (?)....  There was a balcony for the women.  The ark was up front and there were 
seats on the sides, all the way back.  The men were downstairs and the women were upstairs.  \par
}{\plain SF: You had a rabbi in town?\par
}{\plain FF: No, we had a teacher.  The rabbi was in Ansbach and he came twice a year because my father 
was the, what do you call it, the head of the Jewish community...the president, and so he stood 
with \par
}{\plain by us.  He also examined us in school.  He was good.  And then when the teacher, the lehrer, died 
then everything fell apart.  They didn\'92t replace him.  There were no more children there.  All the 
children grew up.  There were no young people except my sister, and then they moved to Munich 
and then those kids, Bianca and Sigbert.  There were no more young people there.  (SF Note: 
This may be an error.  Bianca and Sigbert lived in Wittelshofen.)  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you keep kosher at home?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh, you bet.  Oh, you bet.\par
}{\plain SF: Did you observe the holidays in a special way?  For instance, what did your father do for 
Yom Kippur.\par
}{\plain FF: He stood all the day in the temple with the s???..  With the shroud.  Never sat down.  All day 
long.  He stayed the whole day, and everybody fasted.  We had to bus people in from somewhere 
else in order to have minyan because we didn\'92t have ten people (Note: probably means men) 
anymore.  So we had to bus people in and they stood by us most of the time.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about for Passover.\par
}{\plain FF: Then we didn\'92t have any minyan.  We didn\'92t have any minyan then anymore.  We had two 
nights of Seders.  Each one had their own.  We had my sister and my brother-in-law and Bianca 
and Sigbert.  We had a beautiful Seder plate.  An old Seder plate made out of wood, and it was 
all hand carved.  It was beautiful.  My sister in Munich had a silver one.  A crystal one.  That was 
really beautiful.  We would sit on the chair like this and there was the pillow.  Ooh, I got the 
pillows.  I got the pillow cases here.  They were beautiful(ly) hand made.  It was just very, very 
beautiful. (SF Note: We have two of those pillow cases.)  I was the only one who never sat 
through, because my father couldn\'92t give a nice Seder, he couldn\'92t sing or anything.  So that was 
never.... it was everything done, but it was never done real singing because he had no voice.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did you do on a typical shabbat?\par
}{\plain FF: The women and the men went to temple in the morning every Saturday, with the hat on and 
the gloves on and everything.  Pocketbook.  And we were home.  We just did everything we 
weren\'92t supposed to do.  Go in the fields.  I told you what I did with the flowers.  Didn\'92t I tell 
you?  You couldn\'92t get flowers from the ground, because you couldn\'92t tear it on Shabbos, you 
know.  We had big gardens and the gardens had such beautiful flowers and...I went with Ida and 
my girlfriend in England (Note: Selma.) who just died and the monster (of the?) the field flowers 
was a pink velvet flower and it was so beautiful that I wanted to bring it to my mother but it was 
Shabbos and how could I get it off?  So I laid on the floor and I bit it off, and brought it to my 
mother and I said to my mother, everything I could I gave to my mother, and I said \'93Momma, 
look what I got for you\'94 and she said \'93Where did you get it?  You get this on Shabbos?\'94 and I 
said \'93Yeah, I didn\'92t get it like this, I bit it off.\'94  Every Friday night we had flowers on the table, 
every Friday night, winter and summer.  My mother always had flowers... in the winter you had 
to take them in you know, because there was all this cold weather and all that.  She only had 
flowers for that reason, because we always had flowers on Shabbos.  They were big.  I think we 
were the only house that had it.\par
}{\plain SF: You had a special dinner Shabbat night?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, chicken usually.  That was a delicacy.  Berches.  Potato salad.  (For desert...) It was the 
best.  It was made out of yeast dough, challah dough, Berches dough.  Then she made it with 
blueberries, with apples.  Yeast dough.  It came out baked.  In a black iron pot (cobbler?).  It was 
good.  She was the best cook????  She used to pull me in by the hand.  You would be surprised 
how much you learned anyhow.  And I didn\'92t want to do any housework ever.\par
}{\plain SF: You said you were the only Jewish family in town that had a telephone.\par
}{\plain FF: Yah, in the beginning.  Then the others, some of them got it too.  Around 1920.  No it must 
have been earlier.  My sister got married in 1920 and she had a phone and we had a phone.  It 
must have been about 1918.  \par
}{\plain SF: What other appliances did you have?\par
}{\plain FF: That was about all.  Everything else was done by hand.  Washing by hand.  Then we had one 
thing nobody had.  It was called a mangle.  It was a machine like this, also hand done.  When you 
had your sheets you didn\'92t have to iron them.  You folded them together and let them through.  
There were two round, heavy things and they pressed it.  We were the only in town who had it.  
My mother had all those modern things.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you have a wood stove?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  We had a beautiful stove.  On the platter of the stove.. It used coals and wood.  We had 
a platter, it was shiny like stainless steel.  It was always shiny.  \par
}{\plain SF: How did you keep food?\par
}{\plain FF: We had was is called a schpice.  See our house, as I explained to you before, was built on the 
ruins of a castle.  It was very cold.  The cellar was extremely cold.  From the kitchen we had a 
small room where we had a closet in there and it had a screen in front and that room was so cold, 
what they did to it I don\'92t know.  That\'92s where we kept the food and sometimes it even like 
froze.  There was no stream there.  It came from the cellar up that cold.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were there any other fast days?\par
}{\plain FF: There was Tisha B\'92Av.  There was Erev Pesach.  My father was the first born and the only 
son where he fasted on Tisha B\'92Av and 17}{\plain \super th}{\plain  of Tammuz, Shivos of Tammuz.  They fasted.  Tisha 
B\'92Av we fasted the whole day, since I was 12 years old.  \par
}{\plain SF: Are there any other traditions that you remember?\par
}{\plain FF: Chanukah.  My father went around the table when we sang Mo\'92oz Tzur Yuh Shu Oh See, 
always around the table.  Why I don\'92t know.  He took me by the hand and walked around the 
table.  He had a pewter menorah.  It had lions on it.  They had to be lit with oil and a wick. (SF:  
Was he the only one who lit it?  Did the women light it?)  No.  Are you kidding?  In Europe?  
(SF:  Did you get a present?)   Every day.  Not every day.  But my birthday was around 
Chanukah.  Nobody got every day.  I think we were the only Jewish people who did give each 
other presents.   My birthday presents, Chanukah presents...  \par
}{\plain SF: What types of standard food did you have?\par
}{\plain FF: We had pot roast.  My mother made a lot of pot roast.  Don\'92t forget we had three people as 
help so we always had to cook a lot.  My mother made loaves of bread for Friday.  She made 
three challahs and two loaves of bread and that lasted the whole week.  It was baked once a 
week.  You made it and then it was brought in the bakery.  They baked it for you.  They knew 
exactly which was yours and which wasn\'92t yours.  That was the whole thing for the week.  Then 
we had everything in the garden.  My mother used to say \'93Go out and get lettuce.  Go out and get 
this and get that...\'94  and that\'92s what we did.  It was a good life.  It was a real home life.  \par
}{\plain The women did their sewing.  Their own sewing.  Most of them did their housework.  My mother 
did a lot of baking.  Did a lot of stuff for poor people.  Brought food, a lot of food, in the plastic 
with the leaves on top.  (SF:  Why with leaves?)  I used to save the leaves into the plums and I 
had to bring it to the poor house.  I said to momma \'93Why do you do that?\'94 and she said \'93People 
should think that it was done with love, not just given. They should feel good when the see those 
baskets.\'94  In the meantime, they didn\'92t even care what it looked like as long as they got it.  (SF: 
There was a regular poor house.) There were people who lived there.  There were two families.  
It was not Jewish.  They were poor people and, you know, whoever had a little more than the 
next one...  We, especially we...  I never forget the steps to go up.  I used to say \'93Momma, I don\'92t 
want to go there.  You break your foot.\'94    So my father belonged to the town council.  He 
arranged that those steps were fixed because he says \'93I want this done.\'94  They had a big writeup.  
Because he believed that.  That\'92s where they had ....\par
}{\plain SF: There are a lot of things at home like doilies and things.\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, my mother used to do that when she was younger but she didn\'92t believe on that 
anymore.  She used to say \'93Who needs it?  Who goes around and washes and irons and 
starches?\'94\par
}{\plain SF: Did any of the women do jobs?\par
}{\plain FF: No.\par
}{\plain SF: You were in the choir?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah, in the gentile choir.  In the church choir.  We sang once in the temple.  Bianca\'92s father 
arranged it and we sang on yontif in the temple.   \par
}{\plain SF: Tell me about the time your father snipped off the cross.\par
}{\plain FF: I played in the Christmas pageant.  But it wasn\'92t anything real gentile, it was just a Christmas 
pageant.  I played the queen.  I had to wear a crown.  My hair was all like gold and long up to 
here and it opened up.  It was really good.  I had to wear a crown.  You had to go for rehearsal 
with the crown on and I had trouble because my hair was so thick and the elastic constantly 
snapped off.  So then I had to put the whole hair and put the thing underneath so my mother had 
to lengthen the wire and I had to take it home.  So the next day when we played, this girl said to 
me \'93There\'92s something wrong with your crown.\'94  I said \'93What\'92s wrong with it?  I just took it 
home to have the wire put on, lengthened.\'94  She said \'93There\'92s something not right.\'94  The cross 
was snipped.  It was just the length. Not this way.   The stick was up but not the cross.  \'93So\'94 I 
said \'93Well I don\'92t know what happened..\'94  Nobody saw it, nobody said anything, nobody even 
realized it and I didn\'92t make anything out of it.  On the way home I said \'93Something really 
terrible happened.  Did you see what happened to my cross\'94 My father looked ...   I said \'93Papa, 
did you do it?\'94 and he said \'93Yes.\'94 \'93Why didn\'92t you tell me?\'94  \'93Because I know what you would 
have done.\'94  He says \'93I don\'92t want you to wear a cross.  As long as nobody says anything.  Even 
if they would have said something I would have explained that.  So it went fine and that\'92s all 
there is.\'94  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you go on vacations?  Skiing and stuff?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  We went to Italy.  We went to Switzerland.  Skiing.  In Italy we didn\'92t go skiing.  
That wasn\'92t from home anymore, that was from Munich.  I went away when I was 12 years old.  I 
didn\'92t have much chance.  I helped a lot in the fields.  I loved to do the field work.  I used to feed 
the cows.  My father extra had for me some young animals, they were like young bulls.  They had 
about four of them.  And goats.  I learned to milk on a goat.  My mother said you have to know 
everything and I wouldn\'92t go near a cow.  So my father got me a goat.  I never forget I had red 
velvet house slippers.  Not realizing what I do I went down with the red velvet house slippers and 
here I had to milk a goat.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were any of your father, grandfather in the military?\par
}{\plain FF: My father was in World War I.  In the infantry.  \par
}{\plain SF:  Was your grandfather in the Franco-Prussian War?  FF: I have no idea.\par
}{\plain SF: Were there any special medical things that you remember?\par
}{\plain FF: No, we were all as healthy as a horse.  Nobody was ever sick as long as I remember.  Ever.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about on my father\'92s side?\par
}{\plain FF: His father had asthma, and he stopped working when he was 42 years old.  It was at times 
very bad.  Daddy supported the whole family.  He rode with the bicycle.  Every time he wanted ... 
his mother promised him next time he can buy a motorcycle and every time he had the money 
together his father started building towards the house.  They had the most beautiful house in 
town.  \par
}{\plain FF:  My father was in town politics in Wittelshofen.\par
}{\plain SF: Who sent the castle article.  FF: Yeah, the Germans who are still there.  It is not a friend.  
They took the history of the town.  It was a historian.  There is a girl there, she is as old as 
Bianca.  They are very nice people.  They are elderly people.  She sent it to Ida.\par
}{\plain SF: Were the Jews in Wittelshofen very assimilated or were they kept separate?\par
}{\plain FF: No, they were very assimilated...until the Nazis came. \par
}{\plain SF: Was that recent?  The history of the Jews in Germany is that they suffered persecution 
through time.  \par
}{\plain FF: No we didn\'92t.  Not that I remember.  Everything was fine until the Nazis came.  \par
}{\plain SF: Your grandmother lived with you for a while?\par
}{\plain FF: Forever. Yah.  My father\'92s mother.  See my father was the only child and so my mother 
married into the house.  My mother came..  What happened is this.  My mother\'92s parents died 
and my mother was the youngest.  Then she moved from a small town near W\'fcrzburg to a little 
city near N\'fcrnberg because her sister and her brother-in-law lived there.  He was a teacher there.  
She lived with them until she got married.  So my mother acquired all the city ways of living so 
when she was introduced to my father, before they wrote to the teacher in our town to find out 
about the family.  To find out what the family is like.  You know they used to do that.  He wrote 
back that the Winter family is a very well known family, they are very nice people and they are 
pretty well to do, the only bad part is that there is red hair in the family.  So this wasn\'92t so easy to 
overcome.  My mother didn\'92t mind about that so my mother married in.  They had this in all the 
old house there.  Before you went up the stairs, the bedrooms were up the stairs, and underneath 
the stairs there was a chicken coop.  There were chicken living in the house.  My mother said \'93I 
will not live with animals under the same roof.  Those chickens have to go.  I will not move in 
this house with animals.\'94  So before they got married, they built chicken coops to put chickens 
out because my mother said she wouldn\'92t move in there.  She came from a city.  What are you 
going to do, live with animals in the house?  So they took the chickens out.  Then my mother 
fixed up the house.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain You should see the wedding picture, my mother was a very beautiful woman.  My grandfather 
was crazy about my mother an my grandmother got very jealous.  She tried to hurt my mother 
wherever she could.  The way you were brought up, you never answered back to elders.  My 
mother\'92s mother died when my mother was very young so she wanted to be especially nice to my 
grandmother but she didn\'92t take it nice.  Then my father said \'93There is one thing I\'92m going to tell 
you.  Either you leave my wife alone and appreciate her and act like she is my wife, otherwise we 
move out.\'94  He says \'93I can get another house tomorrow, I will not stand for it \'94 So then she 
changed.  But she still...when my two sisters were born...\par
}{\plain Sf: You said your grandfather was alive then too?\par
}{\plain FF: I didn\'92t know my grandfather.  He died when I was very young.  Either before I was born or 
when I was a very small baby.  I never met him.  But he must have been a very good man.  (My 
father and mother) moved in with both his parents and they had the nicest room in the house, the 
grandparents.  That\'92s what you did.  That was the rule.  That was the respect.  When my second 
sister was born my grandmother was very mad that it wasn\'92t a boy.  When I was born she was 
very happy.  She didn\'92t know what was coming.  My two sisters were so good to her, but not me.  
I know she wasn\'92t nice to my mother so I wasn\'92t nice to her.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain The castle burned down when my grandparents built the house.  The living quarters were 
downstairs and the bedrooms were upstairs.  My sisters were young and they got married when I 
was young.  (My father) bought the house where Bianca\'92s parents lived and Ida\'92s mother lived 
downstairs.  She got the milk from us.  She got the eggs from us.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: You said Ida was illegitimate?  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah, don\'92t tell Ida.  I tell you what happened.  When she went to school she was still Ida 
Bravman and then my father, don\'92t ever, ever whatever you do tell, had to go with her, with Ida\'92s 
mother, to the city, to Dinkelsbuhl to the court, because her husband died, was killed in the war 
and she had those two children where she would get the pension for.   So my father said to her 
\'93It\'92s about time you have that child written over to the same name.  It gives you less trouble and 
less questions and later on its easier for the child to...\'94 and so that\'92s what she did.  She used to 
say me when she was five and when she was seven \'93I went to my mother\'92s wedding, you didn\'92t.\'94  
SF: She had a sister?  FF: Yah, younger.   She was. (can\'92t hear...)\par
}{\plain SF: My father\'92s mother was a Frank before and after she was married.  Were they related?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  Not at all.  It just happened.\par
}{\plain SF: Did my father have any pets when he was young?\par
}{\plain FF: They had a dog.  They even had a picture taken with the dog.  You saw the picture.  \par
}{\plain Like you have a master here, that he could have.... He apprenticed with his father (SF: But his 
father stopped working).  It was always on his father\'92s name.  That\'92s why I don\'92t get any pension.  
See, this is how his mother wrote.  His father still owned the business.  He worked there but his 
father didn\'92t.  You know, you had such respect that you never wrote it over to...  You know that.  \par
}{\plain SF: Is this the passport you used to leave Germany?  FF: Yeah.  From Stuttgart.  \par
}{\plain SF: What does it say here?\par
}{\plain FF: Wittelshofen.  There I was born the 30}{\plain \super th}{\plain .  Wohnort(residence) Stuttgart.  That\'92s why I had to 
go to Stuttgart, to get my papers.  See my Wohnort was Wittelshofen but I had to get it there.  
Mittel. That means I\'92m medium size.  My face is oval.  My eyes are gray and my hair is red.  \par
}{\plain (On Siegfried\'92s passport it says) he was a butcher and he was born in Homburg on Main.  He was 
very small, and then in 1903, when they got married, they moved to Buttenwiesen.  Also his 
figure is mittel and his face is also oval and the eyes are blue/gray and the hair is dark and any 
marks, he had none.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain That\'92s his master.  That he made his master.  See if he would have stayed in butcher out there, he 
could have had help like he could have taught some young people.  See, I just want to show you 
what happened.  Here he had to already be called Israel.  Not me.  I went earlier.  I didn\'92t have to 
be called.  Every Jew had to be called Israel.  See.  Had by Hermann Frank learned.  Three years.  
But you had to make this in front of butchers.  (Notes signatures of people who gave him a test or 
something.)  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain He had the nicest house in Buttenwiesen.  He always said it and the people from Buttenwiesen 
said it.  Sorry to say they are dead now.  That\'92s what daddy said.  That every time he had some 
money saved it went into the house.  He had such fights with his father.  It must have been a 
beautiful house.  After the Hitler time, when they sent the money for the house, he said \'91I don\'92t 
accept it.  This was the nicest house in town and I want to be paid right\'94 and they sent more 
money.  See, he would have gone after them.  He would have gone out.  He said once to me \'93I go 
out.  I want what\'92s coming to me.  I worked too hard or it\'94 and I used to say \'93You have go alone 
without me, with out.\'94  He says \'93I go. Because\'94 he says \'93they owe it to me.  I\'92m not going to let 
it go.\'94  Not like me.  I let everything go.   \par
}{\plain SF: What happened?  It got turned over to the Jewish relief agency?\par
}{\plain FF: Ya.  Ya.  They used that money to resettle refugees.  \'93Maccabee, come here honey.\'94\par
}{\plain SF: Was my father\'92s home just a house or a farm?  Were there a lot of Jews in Buttenwiesen.\par
}{\plain FF: It was a house.  There were a lot of Jews.  (He kept kosher).  Everybody kept kosher.\par
}{\plain SF: But you didn\'92t keep kosher here.\par
}{\plain FF: I started out keeping kosher.  Then he used to get steaks for nothing.  Then I changed.  \par
}{\plain SF: How are we related to the Baums?\par
}{\plain FF: Ruth Baum?  That was from my father\'92s side too.  My grandmother.  Remember Uncle 
Moritz, Ruth\'92s father?  His mother and my grandmother were sisters.  My father and Moritz were 
first cousins.  \par
}{\plain SF:   Were you in Wittelshofen during the Depression?  During the Inflation?\par
}{\plain FF: Ya.  (Her father built a barn and bought a piano).  I was very young.  Me (the inflation) never 
affected.  Not the family either because we had all the eggs and the cows and everything.  The 
people came form the city to us.  \'93Maccabee come here.\'94  Uncle Leo can tell you about the 
inflation.  If there was a depression I didn\'92t know.\par
}{\plain Sf: You said at age 12 you went away to school.  Was that unusual?  Where did you go?\par
}{\plain FF: Very unusual.  N\'fcrnberg.  Those relatives which we supported during the War and 
Depression with food and everything, they said that they always wanted me.  That I can go to 
school from there.  But they didn\'92t treat me nice.  They became very rich.  They were in the hopf 
(hop) business, you know hops, to make beer.  He was such a good man but he was always on the 
go and she was home.  They had two maids and they didn\'92t treat me right.  They didn\'92t treat 
anybody right, they didn\'92t treat the help right either, but they had a heck of a lot of money and...  
From there I didn\'92t have far to go to school.  Four or five.  I went to school six years.  I want to 
tell you something, that\'92s about 50 years ago and I can\'92t remember.  The funny part was, because 
I hated to go back to them, I moved out though.  (Then I lived) with friends and there I was 
forever.  Till I left.  I used to carry the coals up.  They rented out rooms.  We paid them too.  We 
paid them a heck of lot of money and I got weaker and weaker and my father took me to the 
doctor because it affected my eyes and everything and they said we can\'92t believe it but this child 
is undernourished.  It was just terrible.  The uncle had nothing to say.  He was always gone.  He 
was buying this hopf.   In fact he used to bring me presents all the time.  He used to say \'93You 
don\'92t look happy. You don\'92t sound happy....\'94  \'93I am happy\'94 I used to say.  \par
}{\plain (I went to) Hebrew school every day.  We went home and we changed and we went to Hebrew 
school.  Three hours.  I went there until I was finished with school.\par
}{\plain SF: What did you do after you were finished with school?\par
}{\plain FF: I went to Munich and I worked in the butcherei by the Bamburgers.  I had a job in M\'fcnchen 
which was like a house....?  I had to do the cooking because they were very religious and we had 
gentile help.  But they couldn\'92t touch the cooking so I had to do the cooking but she helped me 
with cooking.  I loved to do the butcher shopping.  He used to say, he had two children, Martin 
who was married in Baltimore, who we visited him many times, and the daughter who lived in 
New York.  I mean she, she moved after Hitler...she lived in N\'fcrnberg and from there they 
moved to Schletlinberg(sp?) in Holland and then when Hitler came they moved here.  That\'92s the 
one I visited once and, I told you, she never spoke to me again because I told her daddy worked 
on Shabbos. She said \'93You never should have told me\'94 and I said \'93Why shouldn\'92t I tell you.  
God sees what it is.\'94  (SF: Did you know the Bamburgers before hand.)  FF: No, my sister knew 
them.  Ruth\'92s mother.  He used to say to me \'93If I ever give my business up, you\'92re going to get 
it.\'94  I said to him \'93Herr Bamburger, I would never ever....  It was a butcher shop.  Then I went to 
the Weils.  After that, when they to close (?), I went home for a while.  Then I went from 
relatives to relatives and then I wanted to get my papers and I couldn\'92t get the papers and I had to 
get the papers so I went to Stuttgart.  They wanted me and I went there to get the papers and 
treated me like....   I was discussing it yesterday with Evelyn.  No, this morning.  I had to call him 
Herr Weil, and I was like a house tochter (daughter), like they say you didn\'92t get paid much.  
They didn\'92t even pay social security.  If I wouldn\'92t have gone there I couldn\'92t have gotten my 
papers because they didn\'92t send them back to town so I had to go there.  They had me in their 
hands.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who sent the 20 mark gold piece to my bar mitzvah?\par
}{\plain FF: You mean that time, many years ago?  The Weinschenks lived next door to us.  They had no 
children.  To them I was their child.  (SF: She\'92s the one who gave you the scarf?)  FF: that\'92s the 
mother of them.  She gave it to me, she told me never to give it away, that was her prize 
possession.  The daughter had no children, that\'92s why the mother gave it to me.  The old mother.  
She died.  She was high in the 80s.  Rosa Weinschenk, that was her children, and David was her 
son and he lived near Stuttgart and he had a knitting factory and he married a non-Jewish woman 
and he sent the gold piece because, during the war, I sent him packages and he felt he wanted to 
do that.  That was nice.  He was very generous.  I still got some (letters?...)  He used to say 
\'93What would we do without you.\'94  Then when they could get it, he wrote and said \'93Don\'92t send 
any more.  We get enough.\'94  \par
}{\plain SF: At one point you talked about a teacher of yours who pulled out your hair?\par
}{\plain FF: That was in Streicher\'92s school.  Because I called out ?????.  It was with Streicher.  It was 
Streicher and he had another teacher with him.  And he went there and pulled me, and the guy 
went like this and I got seven stitches. They didn\'92t let me go home.  I didn\'92t sleep and I was all 
stuck with blood (lots of stuff missing here.)  Streicher was a Jew hater.  He wrote \'93Der 
St\'fcrmer,\'94 the paper.  He pulled me out ?????  just because I didn\'92t ?????   I never forget that as 
long as I live.  \par
}{\plain SF: Do you remember preparing to leave?  What happened?\par
}{\plain FF: I couldn\'92t leave.  I couldn\'92t get my papers.  I couldn\'92t stay home because my mother said to 
me \'93You have to leave because you get yourself and us in trouble\'94 because I couldn\'92t believe 
what happened.  When they threw down the silver thing, when they came and broke the 
windows.  They came to the house and they wanted money.  My mother opened the drawer and 
she says \'93We don\'92t have any money home\'94 so they took the thing and they threw it upside down 
and then they went and then they took the leather weight my uncle gave me.  It was such a 
beautiful one.  I always wanted to replace it but every time I get to it I can\'92t buy it.  Then they 
shot the dogs.  Then I cried and my mother  said to me \'93You\'92re gonna cry for the dogs.  You\'92re 
gonna cry for yourself someday soon, and for us.\'94  Then they went to the window and threw it 
through the window.  By us was everything on hills.  They threw the silver ladle, and this... (SF: 
Did they confiscate a lot of things.)  FF: At that time they didn\'92t.  They just threw everything out.  
They didn\'92t take anything away.  It was in 1937.  I just stood there.  I couldn\'92t believe it.  I just 
couldn\'92t believe it.  There were three (Nazis).  In regular dress. My mother said \'93Kind, you have 
to leave because you bring yourself....  I took one arm and I said \'93Get out of here.\'94  I just 
couldn\'92t believe it.  I said \'93I can take it.\'94  So he turned around and looked at me.  I said \'93I can 
take it. I can beat the life out of you.  Who do you think you are, breaking into houses like this?\'94  
He turned around and he went like this, like to say \'93You\'92re going to get it next.\'94  My mother saw 
that.  I couldn\'92t believe it.  I just couldn\'92t.  \par

}{\plain SF: You needed a guarantee of a job.\par
}{\plain FF: No.  I needed an affidavit.  It said that the person who gives you the affidavit is responsible 
for you.  In case you come and you get sick, he has to take care of you.  You\'92re not supposed to 
be a ward to the state or country.  So then I didn\'92t hear and didn\'92t hear so Gretl Weil sister-in-law 
came also here and she called up Aunt Saler and she said to her \'93Flora is waiting for an affidavit 
from your brother, and if he can\'92t give it then my brother-in-law (Note: meaning Herbert Winter, 
brother of Gretl Weil) would it to me to bring it back so she says \'93Well, my brother would give it 
to her immediately but my sister wrote that Flora has trouble with her knees and she\'92s going to be 
trouble for him.\'94  This is something I don\'92t even think you should put on the tape.  This was my 
mother\'92s niece, Aunt Saler\'92s sister, who lived in a small town, also near Stuttgart and she had a 
breast operation and they were, at one time, very rich.  Then he gambled everything away and 
then they were very poor and she was very sick.  She wrote to my parents that they should help 
her and I should please come.  My mother said \'93Please go there.  You do a big mitzvah.\'94  That 
was when I was in-between, you know.  So I went there and helped her and she was sick that 
time and came home from the hospital, and I took care of her.  He was a real woman chaser that 
was part of why they lost a lot, because he had to pay off girls.  Then wherever he was he puts his 
arm around me and first I thought....then all of a sudden he wanted to get fresh so I got very 
panicky.  My cousin was upstairs in the bedroom and I was down there and I prepared a meal and 
all this.  Then the doctor came, Dr. Mertzbach and visited her every so often.  I had trouble with 
my foot because when I was very young I fell in skiing and my knee got water, in the kneecap 
was full of water.  I said to him \'93Dr. Mertzbach, I have trouble with my foot.  What am I 
supposed to do?\'94 He says \'93I want to tell you something.  Your cousin is well enough to take care 
of herself and you have to go to the consulate in time to come.  You better go home and nurse 
your foot.  Otherwise you never make it.\'94  When I told her that Dr. Mertzbach said I really 
should go home now.  You\'92re well enough.  You go to caf\'e9 every afternoon grenzien(?) and all 
that so I\'92m going to go home.\'94  Because I paid all her bills she didn\'92t like that and she wrote to 
Simon that I\'92m going to be a risk for him.  Irene who came here said \'93Flora has trouble with her 
knee.  That\'92s a new one on me.  What kind of a thing is this.  Forget about your brother.  I bring 
her one from Herbert.\'94  She sent me one from Herbert and they sent me one from Detroit.  Then I 
had two.   \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Then I started working at it and the first thing I needed the birth certificate and couldn\'92t get the 
birth certificate because he says he\'92s not going to give Jews birth certificates.  So I didn\'92t know 
what to do.  I got very panicky.  Bianca\'92s mother corresponded with Aunt Gretl.  So she says 
\'93Aunt Gretl would love to have you.  Then you be right there.  If you\'92re away from here and 
write for your birth certificate, he has to mail it.  He has to send it, yet.\'94  I mean later on they 
probably could do what they want.  So I went to Stuttgart and I wanted to take a lawyer first.  
Then I went to one of those organizations, whatever they were and they said \'93we write for you 
and, if not, you have to take a lawyer\'94 because he has to hand it out.  That\'92s how I got my birth 
certificate in Stuttgart.  They had me in their hands and I stood with them because I needed them.  
That\'92s how I got the affidavit.  And that\'92s all.  Then I went to the consulate and they let me go 
through like nothing.\par
}{\plain SF: There\'92s some story about somebody not wanting to give you the papers?  A girl that you 
grew up with.\par
}{\plain FF: That was in the post office.  Well see what happened was this.  The affidavit came to, the 
papers came to my home town.  When Irene came back she wrote to me or called me up, I forgot 
now what it was, and she says \'93Your papers must come any day.\'94  I went there and I wanted to 
get the papers and I saw something laying there with stamps on it, like American stamps.  So I 
said to her \'93There is my mail.  Give it to me.\'94 She says \'93We don\'92t hand the mail to Jews.  There 
was this post office.  It had the door like this, half the size.  Here they gave you the mail and here 
on the bottom, that\'92s where they opened up to hand you the packages. She said \'93I\'92m not giving it 
to you.\'94  So I pushed my foot in like this and I went underneath and I threw her in the corner and 
I said \'93You give it to me.  Otherwise you and me, none of us is going to come out alive here.\'94  
Then she handed it to me.  Then I threw her in the corner.  \par
}{\plain SF: Then you went home and got packed?\par
}{\plain Then I went home and then I had to go for the birth certificate.  No I didn\'92t get packed because I 
had to find out first how long it takes with the affidavit.  You don\'92t get it right away.  That takes 
a long time.  They had to inquire.  That took months and months.  It took a year.  A year and a 
half.  That\'92s what happened.  Then the Weils left and I was then I wasn\'92t even sure then that I get 
it.  Then I wouldn\'92t know where to go in Stuttgart because the Lowenthals, Saler and Weils left 
at the same time.  Then three or four days before this wonderful man came from the (Bureau of 
Records) and he says to me  \'93I saw you were so nervous and I figured it takes a while.  I\'92m going 
to give it to you.\'94 He brought me my passport.  He was such a fine man.  He says \'93I hate to see 
what\'92s going on but what can I do?\'94  He was a wonderful man.    \par
}{\plain SF: So then you went home and packed?\par
}{\plain FF: Then I went home and I wanted to pack.  They wouldn\'92t take my packages on the mail.  The 
post office wouldn\'92t take my mail.  Wouldn\'92t take my package.  We didn\'92t have trunks made.  
We had the steamers.  The regular steamers.  I had to ship it to Munich because it has to be 
inspected and there was no one who would ever come home to inspect it.  You couldn\'92t go from 
there.  In the meantime we had still two horses and we had still our wagon.  We were the only 
ones who had a wagon, where we loaded the cows in to bring it to the markets.  So we loaded the 
trunks and we brought it to where Herta comes from, to that city, to that town (Note: 
Wassertr\'fcdigen), because we didn\'92t have any railroad where we came from and the post office 
wouldn\'92t mail it.  So we brought it there to the railroad and then they shipped it to M\'fcnich, to 
Ruth\'92s parents and from there on I went.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain In Munich Ruth\'92s father got me the trunks.  They had to be made to certain specifications and he 
did it.  I had in there two or three winter coats, a winter suit, my leather coat with fur on the 
bottom and fur on the neck, and I can\'92t tell you what else.  My God what...  My mother came to 
Munich.  She wanted to see me packing.  This man who packed was so good.  He say\'92s...We had 
to pack it down where my sister lived, in the washroom.  You had to give them a certain place.  
So he says \'93I\'92m going out for lunch now.  I be back in an hour.  I have to go to lunch.  I be back 
in an hour.\'94  He left everything open.  There was no seals.  People used to tell me that they had 
iron straps around, metals straps around.  You could put in whatever you want.  My mother came 
to Munich and I said at that time \'93Momma, what are you carrying?\'94  She says \'93A few things.\'94  
My mother went down and put....I couldn\'92t go near it.  I couldn\'92t go near the packing.  I couldn\'92t 
care what they put in.  Ruth\'92s mother went down.  She says to me \'93You don\'92t even know what 
you have.  Go down.\'94  I said \'93I couldn\'92t see.\'94  I couldn\'92t see anything from home being taken 
and given to me.  Like my mother wanted to give me the candelabra and they lit it every Friday 
night.  I said \'93Momma, I can\'92t take it.  How can I enjoy it when I know...\'94 And I wasn\'92t married 
then so how do I know I ever need it.  I said \'93Momma, I can\'92t take it.  I just can\'92t take it\'94 and I 
wouldn\'92t.  This silver ladle I took because I said \'93This will always remind me of what it was.\'94  
My mother said \'93You have to have it fixed.\'94  I said \'93No. Its going to remind me.  I never have it 
fixed.\'94  Someday when you get it you can have it fixed if you want.  \par

thing....Well, no, I never got my trunk.  That was a big, brown trunk with the initials on FW and 
when I went from...I wanted to go from Karlsr\'fche into France because Bianca\'92s brother learned 
to be a baker.  You had to learn a trade, you know.  He was there to say goodbye to me and I 
wanted to see him once more.  He was my everything really.  He was like a brother to me.  I 
looked out of the train and I didn\'92t see my... they disconnected certain wagons and I looked and 
looked and I saw a lot of trunks on that one wagon and it didn\'92t go into France.  (In it)were my 
winter coats and my clothes in there.  My coats, my skirts, my shoes.  \par
}{\plain SF: And stuff your mother put in too?\par
}{\plain FF: No. No.  That was the trunk, all clothes.  I really don\'92t know anymore what was in it.  I had a 
big trunk.  That I didn\'92t even see.  That I did not see.  That was direct going to the boat or 
something.  I really don\'92t know what was...  That had metal strips around it and all that kind of 
stuff.  \par

}{\plain I went to Paris.  I had a boyfriend there.  Before I left my father, who could not stay in the room 
with me alone, whenever he came in he cried.  He said to me \'93I want you to promise me in my 
hand that you will leave France.  Once you leave you have to leave Europe and you have to 
promise me.  You cannot stay in Paris.\'94  Because he knew I liked that man very much.  He was a 
veterinarian.  He says \'93You have to leave Europe and you promised me that and a promise is 
holy.\'94 I come to Paris on Friday and Leubrecht(sp?) was very fromm (pious, religious) and I look 
out the window and all of a sudden he threw a big bunch of flowers at me.  It was already 
Shabbos.  I said to myself \'93What am I going to do here now.  Its late already.\'94  It was a delay 
somehow.  I figured I take a taxi because I knew which hotel I go to.  That was all arranged. I 
said \'93How do you come on Shabbos?\'94  He says \'93We gave in to a few things\'94 he says.  \'93That\'92s 
one of them.\'94  We were happy to see each other and all that.  Then he invited me to go to Friday 
night to his uncle who was a veterinarian in Paris.  Dr. Leubrecht.  (SF: How did you meet him?) 
In M\'fcnchen.  He was a friend of Martin Bamberg.  He liked me then already and I liked him 
already.  But he always said \'93Look, we have to leave.  There is no sense getting serious here 
because who knows where luck goes\'94 and I felt its true.  Then after we were there and we ate, 
and they were very religious, very fine people, he says to him \'93Did you tell Fra\'fclein Winter 
what\'92s what?\'94  He says \'93No, no.  Later.\'94  So I felt very uncomfortable so I said....this is the first 
time I traveled on Shabbos too, because I couldn\'92t help it, so I said \'93How far is the hotel.  I feel 
very uncomfortable traveling on Shabbos.\'94  He says \'93When you\'92re in a strange country you do 
things you never thought you would do.\'94  So we walked and I said to him \'93What did your uncle 
want you to tell me?\'94  He says \'93Oh, I got a big surprise for you.  A big surprise.\'94  I was looking.  
I thought he was going to give me a ring or something.  I said \'93What\'92s the surprise?\'94  He said 
\'93You not going to leave here.  You gonna stay here.\'94  I said \'93What for?\'94  He said \'93Because we 
got you Auffelhatsgennamt (sp?)  We got you a paper that you can remain here.\'94  He said it was 
\'93...very, very hard and we pulled a lot of strings to get that.\'94 I said \'93You\'92re out of luck.  I can\'92t 
stay here.\'94  He says \'93What do you mean?\'94  I said \'93I promised my father.\'94  He said \'93Promises are 
broken.\'94  I said \'93Not to my father. I would never break a promise (to him).\'94 He says \'93You cannot 
do it to my uncle.\'94  I said \'93I do it to you and I do it to your uncle.  I promised my father.  I cannot 
go back on my promise.\'94  I said my father said it broke his heart for me to leave but I have to 
leave Europe.  He said \'93That\'92s ridiculous.  Nothing is going to happen here.\'94  I said \'93My father 
doesn\'92t say ridiculous things.  What my father says it is always true.\'94  He says \'93Please don\'92t do 
that.\'94\par

}{\plain So we had to go to his uncle the next day on Shabbos.  First we went outside to a big, big 
department store.  We couldn\'92t go in because we couldn\'92t carry money.  I carried every paper I 
had with me.  Then his uncle said \'93Did you hear, did you hear?\'94  I said.  \'93Dr. Leubrecht.  I don\'92t 
know how to tell you but I might as well tell you right away.  I am not staying in Paris.\'94  He got 
pale.  He had a beard.  He got so pale  He says \'93I cannot believe it.\'94  I said \'93I promised my father 
that I leave Europe.\'94  So he says to me \'93If you promised.  Das ist ein gebot (sp?)\'94 he says.  \'93And 
you have to fulfill it.  I understand.\'94  He understood but Leubrecht didn\'92t understand.  He never 
wanted to understand it.  I said to him \'93You come to America.\'94  I said \'93I try if you want to come 
to America.\'94  But he started to finish studying.  He wanted to get done with it.  So that\'92s how I 
got to America.  Leubrecht was killed too.  The whole family was killed I found out.  \par

M\'fcnchen.  His name was Mr. Lehrs.  He did that for people.  He opened the skis.  As a 
shoemaker he knew how to do that.  Like you put soles together.  We went to Switzerland and 
the skis.  You could never take the skis into the train.  You know, there was extra provision 
outside to put it in.  That\'92s how we went.  Then we got there and there was a man, another Jewish 
man, Mr. Tzimitz (sp?), who opened them.  You couldn\'92t get smuggle money out from Germany.  
You were never allowed to legally...  That was the only place you could put money.  I didn\'92t 
know anybody in... You had to bring your own money in by yourself.  (SF: you smuggled money 
into the banks in Switzerland?) FF: Yah, you got to Mr. Tzimitz and you had to pay Mr. Tzimitz 
something for opening your thing and he got a cut in there too.  (SF: so you smuggled money in 
for later?) FF: You wrote to Switzerland that they should transfer it to America.  That\'92s what 
happened and that\'92s where I lost it all.  \par

}{\plain SF: Did anybody give you gifts when you left?\par
}{\plain FF: Everybody.  My sisters gave me rings which I gave to Bianca.  I gave her the rings.  They

they gave me.  This little thing I got too.  The little bowl up there and the birds I got.  This I got

}{\plain FF: Daddy had a hard job.  He got the affidavit through a gentile friend in Buttenwiesen who had 
relatives here.  Through a relative here, his name was Frankenthaler, who was some kind of 
bigshot at the produce exchange.  Once he got here he didn\'92t want to know anything about 
anybody.  He got here (Frankenthaler) and he stood with Hella and Jack Lehman.  They got him 
room and board.  They helped him for that affidavit in that Frankenthaler because they got a 
roomer that time.  They needed it to rent out rooms.  Uncle Leo got him that job.  Before he came 
he had the job already.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who gave him the affidavit?\par
}{\plain FF: This man, his name was Frankenthaler, and some man I don\'92t exactly how that worked, a 
gentile man from his hometown who had relatives here, who wanted to help him or helped him, I 
can\'92t tell you exactly.  But Hella and Jack Lehman went to that Frankenthaler who was related to 
Hella\'92s father and daddy\'92s mother, they were brother and sister, and he got them the affidavit and 
they went there because they know when daddy comes he will stay with them and pay them room 
and board and be baby sitter for Laura.  \par
}{\plain SF: How did my father end up in Dachau?\par

elderly Jewish man who died right in his arms.  He just had to lay down.  From marching and 
starvation.  He couldn\'92t march because the numbers...that daddy\'92s feet... Do you remember his 
toes were so crippled?  That was from that.  He forced himself to do it.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Did he have nightmares about it?  FF: Oh God, I tell you something.  It was unbelievable. He 
went like this all night (Note: FF showed arms flailing). That was already a year later or a year 
and a half later.  Did he have nightmares.  It was terrible.  I wanted him to go to a doctor.  He 
wouldn\'92t go.  He says \'93You help me. You help me.\'94  Oh he was hit and everything.  It was 
terrible.  SF: What was the food like?  FF: I don\'92t know.  If he ever (described it) I don\'92t know.  
They beat him.  He got out because the mayor of his hometown was a friend of his and he 
(daddy) had a group, an athletic group.  He was the leader of an athletic group.  They all went to 
fight for him.  They said \'93We want him out, we want him out\'94 and they got him out.  Somehow 
or another.  They were different than by us.  Then he got here.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: You said the Nazis came and took away your goods?\par
}{\plain FF: We lived up the hill.  They just took it down.  What they did with you, where the loaded 
(it)... You couldn\'92t go to the window and look.  They turn around and shoot you.  SF: did they 
take your father\'92s wagon?  FF: Not while I was there.  1938 and then the Kristalnacht was in 
October of 1938.  I left in April.  March or April.  That was \'9138.  Then they confiscated 
everything.  They threw you out.  I understood they took my parents and the Jewish people there 
to a prison.  They had to walk.  How they ever came from that prison to my sister in Munich I 
never found out because it was a big distance and I don\'92t think they had any money or anything.  
I don\'92t know.  I just don\'92t know.  I like to know that myself and never found out.  \par
}{\plain SF: Do you remember where you were when the war broke out? \par
}{\plain FF: I was pregnant with you a week or two.  December 7}{\plain \super th}{\plain .  We had company.  The Meyers.  My 
thoughts were \'93Oh my God, I hope daddy doesn\'92t have to go and I hope I can hear from my 
parents.  I hope they don\'92t break us up that I don\'92t hear from them anymore.\'94  Then we wrote to 
them and we told them when you were born.  Then I got a telegram.  A Red Cross letter.  Did I 
ever tell you that?  I wrote them from the hospital when you were born, and also to my in-laws.  
My father always said to me \'93If we can\'92t write to you direct, we write with the Red Cross.\'94  See, 
he was so smart that he knew all this but he still didn\'92t want to leave.  He said \'93strenge hen 
redieren nicht mar (sp?)\'94\'96strong men will not last long.  Everybody said that.  They never 
thought that he would last long.  So then I was nursing you and the mailman rang from 
downstairs.  He lived up on top, on the third floor.  Remember that?  No, you were too small.  I 
called down and said \'93What is it?\'94  He said \'93Mrs. Frank I got a Red Cross letter\'94 and I run down 
and he handed me the letter and I fainted.  I thought it was a letter that my parents weren\'92t alive 
anymore and I fainted and I hit my head against the steps and I lost milk.  You kept screaming 
and screaming and they wrote a letter in which they congratulated us for your birth and they said 
they were so happy that we got a boy, because I always wanted a boy.  So that was the letter and I 
never had any milk and I went to the doctor, Dr. Wesley, and I said I can\'92t understand this child 
is crying day and night and he tried and he says \'93You\'92re all dried out.  What happened?\'94  I told 
him and he said \'93When you\'92re scared that can happen.\'94  Then I had to put you on milk.  You 
know, and all kinds of formulas, whatever that was.  That\'92s why you turned out so good.\par
}{\plain  \par
}{\plain SF: What kind of persecution do you remember?\par
}{\plain FF: They wanted to beat me but I never stood still long enough.  Constantly name calling and all 
this.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was this the people in the town?  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah, they were not too bad to me.  In fact there were some of the boys that I went to school 
with, to public school, and they came at night.  We had around our house those big gardens and 
they came in the bushes, crawling, and they came up and they said \'93Don\'92t you leave Flora.  We 
don\'92t want you to go.  No one\'92s going to do anything to you.  We don\'92t want you to go.\'94  There 
were a few boys who said that.  FF: I said no.   What changed you...\par
}{\plain SF: I thought you said people who you used to help were spitting at you?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, the neighbors when I went down from my house to pass by.  I had to pass by.  She said 
\'93Heinele (fond term for Heinrich), what do you do when Flor passes by?\'94 and he spit.  That\'92s the 
only thing I wrote back to that mayor when he says I should come and visit or something.  I wrote 
back to him, that\'92s the first time I wrote back to Wittelshofen, I said \'93What happened to those 
people?\'94  And I wrote to which people I meant and he say\'92s they all died.  Too bad.  He says he 
remembers my parents very well.  I even know who he was.  He was a little boy.  Maybe now in 
the 50s.  He was a little kid then.  \par
}{\plain SF: You had several workers on the farm?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  We had those neighbors.  We supported them and we gave them half of our gardens 
too.  See our gardens went around five houses and that house was one of them and they didn\'92t 
have much garden on their own.  So my father always said \'93Take care of it and whatever comes 
off the tree you take.\'94  That\'92s what happened.  They took it and then they turned against us.   \par
}{\plain FF: (The workers) helped with the hay.  You had to get the grass off the ground and you had to 
work it and all that.  Whatever you have to do on a farm they did.  Our man lived above the barn 
because he had to feed the animals when you had the high snow.  You couldn\'92t leave the house.  
The barns were just down the road but you couldn\'92t get out of the house.  You couldn\'92t open the 
shutters.  Sometimes two or three days.  Always had enough stuff in the house because you 
couldn\'92t...you always had everything in the house anyway.  That was a good time.  That\'92s when 
you were home and the house was so nice and warm and all that.  It was very comfortable.  Very 
good.  \par
}{\plain SF: Two stories.  One when you came home once and nobody wanted to light the fire because it 
was Shabbos and the other when you came home and there was a beggar there and you wouldn\'92t 
eat with him.  \par
}{\plain FF: That was when I went to high school.  He was in the bus with me.  We had no train.  As I 
told you there was no train depot where I came from.  The train went to where Aunt Herta came 
from, der Wassertr\'fcdigen, and from there we had to take a bus.  The bus went there twice a day, 
morning and  afternoon.  The trains met the bus.  Otherwise sometimes you had to wait a half 
hour.  So I went in the bus and there was this man with a black coat and a beard, and when we 
got closer to the town he says to me \'93where is the banas(?),\'94 that means the president of the 
Jewish thing. So I said \'93Oh, that\'92s my father,\'94  I said.  So he says \'93Well how do I get to him?\'94  I 
said \'93Oh, they\'92re going to be at the bus to pick me up so you can talk to him.\'94  I went out before 
him because I didn\'92t respect this type of people.  My father was already mad when he saw me 
going out before an old man.  So I said \'93Papa, there is the Pollack who wants to talk to you\'94 so 
my father said to him \'93What can I do for you?\'94  He must have told him he is poor or whatever.  I 
don\'92t know.  My father said to him \'93You come home with me and we take care of you.\'94  So I put 
my papa on the side and hugged and kissed him and I said \'93Papa, if this Pollack eats at our table, 
I\'92m not going to sit with him.  I\'92m not going to sit at the same table as that Pollack sits.\'94  My 
father just put me down and walked away, back to this man, and excused himself and went to this 
man.  Before we up to our house he called my mother and he talked to my mother something.  
When I came home up there, oh God the maids were there with big hellos and the table was set 
so nice and always flowers on the table and a present, always a present when I came home.  My 
mother used to hang the present on the window so that when I came up the hill I saw already that 
a present was waiting for me.  You know that Tyrolean jackets or whatever.  So I went in there 
and I wanted to take the present down and my mother said \'93Leave it here till later.  Leave it 
here.\'94  I thought \'93That must be a big thing that I have to leave it there.  I can\'92t rip it apart right 
away.\'94  Then my mother went out into the kitchen where the soup was steaming and everything, 
whatever there was.  I don\'92t know anymore.  I helped carrying it in.  The soup by us was always 
served in a soup tureen.  We never ladled it out.  It was done in the kitchen and then you brought 
it in.  Then my mother said \'93You take this plate.  Take it out in the kitchen\'94 so I took it out to the 
kitchen.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain I was sure I said that I wouldn\'92t eat with that man on the table there so he is eating out there.  I 
wanted to sit down and my mother said \'93No, you brought your place out there, that\'92s where you 
eat.\'94  \'93Not me in the kitchen.\'94  \'93Yes, you in the kitchen.  You wouldn\'92t eat with this poor man, 
so you have to eat where he isn\'92t.  That\'92s the kitchen.\'94  There were the cats and there were the 
dogs and there was I, because our help always ate on the table.  I cried and I cried and I cried so 
loud that my father just couldn\'92t help hearing it.  Then he came out.  He says \'93What is it?\'94  \'93I 
have to eat here because this Pollack eats in there.\'94  My father said \'93This is not a Pollack.  This is 
a poor man, a poor religious man, and I want to tell you something right now.  If this is why we 
sent you away, to come back as such a snot nose, then you aren\'92t going to go back.  You stay 
home because you have to learn bringing up at home.  They don\'92t do it, we will do it.\'94   My 
father never spoke like this to me.  He went in again and there I ate.  I wouldn\'92t even go in to get 
more food.  I wouldn\'92t go in and get my meat.  Our help they were sitting there and they felt 
terrible.  That\'92s where I had a terrible day.  I had a few terrible days, and my mother said to me 
\'93If you learned a lesson, you can come back.\'94   The next day I couldn\'92t eat there either.  The man 
was gone but my mother said \'93You learned a lesson, if you learned a lesson.\'94  But I came to 
Munich and every time a Pollack came like this, I felt the same way.  Mr. Schindler was a real 
Pollack.  He said to me \'93I am gonna bring you a Pollack.  You\'92re gonna marry a Pollack.\'94  I said 
\'93Mr. Schindler, don\'92t punish me, don\'92t say that..\'94  I don\'92t know.  I never learned it at home.  I 
never learned it at home.  Just a terrible, terrible thing.  I felt very bad.  \par
}{\plain  \par
}{\plain SF: What about the fire?\par
}{\plain FF: The fire?  I came home and in between coming here and staying home, still waiting for my 
papers and all that, and it was very, very cold.  God it was so cold.  See I left in April or March 
and I was home for two months.  It was winter.  Winter.  So we sat there and we sat there, my 
momma wrapped up in things.  I said \'93Momma, that\'92s no good.  If you get sick, you have no 
doctor.  You can\'92t do it.  So my mother said \'93I can\'92t lay in bed all the time.\'94  We had no more 
help, we had no more maids, nobody you know.  I said \'93I\'92m going to do something.  I know it\'92s a 
sin but I\'92m gonna do it.  Before you and papa get sick I\'92m gonna go out and make a fire.\'94  My 
mother went like this but she said to herself \'93I wish she would do it.\'94  I went out and I put in a 
fire and the wood was cracking and I went in and said \'93You\'92re gonna feel all right soon.  I don\'92t 
feel good in doing it.  I did it the first time in my life but you\'92re not going to get sick because 
there is no one, no doctor who would take you, no hospital who would take you.\'94  I said \'93You 
need to help yourself.\'94 (SF: Because they were Jewish?)  FF: Yah.  So my mother didn\'92t answer 
me.  My papa comes down and says \'93What is it, what is it?\'94  My mother says \'93The Goye are 
here.\'94  My father went right back up in his room.  I said \'93Papa, I know you say that I am half a 
goy for doing it.  What\'92s going to be if you are sick?  If the lieber Gott (dear God) sees this, why 
do you do this kind of thing?  Why do you sit here?  It\'92s the first time in my life I did it, but 
somebody has to help you people.\'94  He said \'93I don\'92t know who brought you up, I don\'92t know.  
The big ones would have never done it.\'94  He always said that.  I said \'93Well I did it and I do it.  
I\'92m glad I did it.\'94  Then they came.  Then the Oberdorfers came and the Gallingers came.  They 
all came to see what the goye did.  And every Saturday they came marching in.  They knew I\'92m 
gonna do it anyhow.  But I put food in the stove to heat up.  My parents wouldn\'92t eat it.  That 
they wouldn\'92t do.  (SF: Because you had cooked it on Shabbat?) FF: Yah.  I heated it up.  SF: 
When did they normally eat on Shabbos?  FF: After Shabbos was out.  We usually ate the main 
meal lunchtime but on Shabbos we didn\'92t.  We ate the main meal after Shabbos.  That\'92s what I 
did.  I ate.  \par
}{\plain SF: The maids left at that point?\par
}{\plain FF: They had to leave.  Long before.  (SF:  Nobody would let them work there.) No.  They made 
it terrible for them.  \par
}{\plain SF: When did it get really bad?  \par
}{\plain FF: It got bad already before I left.  When I left it was already bad.  But they left us alone.  
Somehow they were afraid of me or they liked me.  They liked me.  The town really liked me.  
Whenever I came home they brought me flowers and everything.  They always said when I come 
sunshine comes.  \'93Oh, Flora is home.  The sun is shining.\'94  They always said that.  In fact, once 
made a joke.  It was so snowy, they said \'93Send Flora out, the snow is gonna melt.\'94  I was always 
very happy.  I had no reason not to be.  The only trouble what I had was with my hair.  They 
didn\'92t like red hair.  I got over that very fast, because it was such a beautiful hair.  It was so, so 
full of luckin(?) they used to say.  When I had it open, when I played...I had braids and when you 
opened the braids it was just like gold flowing.  It was very red.  At times it was redder.  They 
told me in the summer that if you go in the sun, the sun is bleaching it so I walked around in the 
sun like crazy.  I wanted bleached hair.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Tell me about where your mother looked up and said \'93there won\'92t be anything but trouble 
from there.\'94  Was it Berchesgarten?\par
}{\plain FF: No. That was our mountain (Note: the Hesselberg). Not Berchesgarten.  Is near Munich.  
From our bedroom, the view from my parents bedroom was so beautiful.  All the mountains were 
there.  It was just beautiful.  Some people came... we had this doctor and he used to come and he 
used to say \'93Please let me paint from this window.\'94  And they did.  I used to say \'93Oh, momma, it 
looks so beautiful\'94 but you get so used to it.  She says \'93This is going to bring nothing but tzoris 
(trouble)\'94 and it did bring tzoris.  They put a youth castle up there and that\'92s where they came 
every few weeks, der Streicher and the Goering and the thing.  They came with the white coats 
and with the big glasses, those dark glasses.  We used to wear them for skiing.  You know, the 
blinders.  They came and when they came the bells were ringing.  The heart cruze (Swastika?) 
went up, the flags went up.  It was just terrible.  My mother used to say \'93Didn\'92t I tell you it\'92s a 
curse.\'94  It was a curse.  \par
