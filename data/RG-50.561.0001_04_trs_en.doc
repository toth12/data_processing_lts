}{\plain RECORD ED 2/16/87\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: You wrote to your parents.  How often did they write back to you?\par
}{\plain FF: Well, you could still write there.  That was 38.  When I told them.  I told them what 
wonderful jobs I had.  I didn\'92t tell them what work I did.  They sent me people to visit me when 
they came over here.  Gretl Weil used to send me all the people who sold things.  Some of those 
German people who came here, they were a lot of doctors and lawyers and they had to start 
school again and they had no money so they sold canned stuff and stockings and everybody who 
she knew she sent to me.  I bought all that stuff because I couldn\'92t say \'91no\'92 and then I gave it all 
to her.  What was I going to do with canned stuff?  I worked for people.  I worked for some 
people they didn\'92t give me enough to eat.  \par
}{\plain SF: So then you had to spend your own money to eat?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  I left.  They had very terrible underwear.  I couldn\'92t stand that.  I had to wash it.  They 
had such torn, dirty underwear and I got sick over it.  I couldn\'92t... I had to sleep in the....  They 
had one child, they were teachers, and I had to wait till they were in bed and then I could sleep in 
the hall.  The hall had no light, and no window.  No nothing.  They just put a cot up.  They had 
like a paper closet.  You know, one of those brown paper things.  That\'92s where then hung my 
clothes in and I had nothing for my underwear and this I dropped in the bottom of the closet.  I 
said I can\'92t.  Then I had to do the wash and then one day she brought a lot of wash and I had to 
drip this all in the kitchen.  I said to myself \'93This is funny.  They don\'92t wear this kind of 
underwear.  Flannel long nightshirts and this.\'94  She brought her parents to me too to wash.  So I 
said to her \'93No.  I can\'92t.  You\'92re too tricky for me.\'94  I said \'93What do you think I am, a slave?\'94  
She says \'93You ought to be glad you have something to eat.\'94  I said \'93I\'92m not that hungry that I 
have to make a slave for you.\'94  I slammed the door and walked out.  Oh they were so tricky, you 
have no idea.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Then I got another job as a cook. Then they never paid us in time.  They had no money.  They 
lived above their means.  They lived on the East Side (Note: Of New York City).  Then they 
claimed that a lot of stuff was stolen.  Plates and linen and things.  They wanted to get some 
money somehow.  Then they came, the detectives came and they questioned us.  There was a 
chamber maid and me and I couldn\'92t believe it.  I said \'93Why do you ask us such questions?  I 
never took a handkerchief or a piece of paper which didn\'92t belong to me.\'94  They said \'93Well, it 
was stolen.\'94  I said \'93 I don\'92t steal anything.  I don\'92t need that kind of stuff.  I have more stuff than 
I need.\'94  So then I left too because I was hurt.  Then I went to Proskauer.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain No.  Then I took a job with an old couple.  It was opposite the Museum of, what was the 
museum, the one you look into the skies and the stars?  The Planetarium.  There was my room, 
was a small room that went off the kitchen.  I couldn\'92t lock it at night so I put the chair on to 
keep the door closed.  All of a sudden I woke up and I said to myself \'93I see this door moving\'94 
and that old fuzzy duddy comes marching in and wants to touch me all over.  I hit him on the 
hand and got up 3 o\'92clock in the morning and packed my suitcase.  When she got up I said \'93I\'92m 
leaving.\'94  She says \'93Why are you leaving.  I\'92m so satisfied and all this.\'94  I said \'93I don\'92t want to 
hurt you.  I can\'92t tell you the truth.\'94  I said \'93Just let me leave.\'94  I dragged my suitcases on 81}{\plain \super st}{\plain  
Street to the subway and went up to the Weils.  Brought my stuff and she said \'93What happened?\'94  
I said \'93That old guy came and he wanted to fool around.\'94  Oh, God, I tell you.  You think he 
couldn\'92t hold a cup himself.  Starts fooling around we me.  So I left there too.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Then I went to Proskauer.  I saw it advertised in the paper that they needed a kitchen maid for 
Lake Placid.  So I went there.  Gretl says to me \'93How do you expect to do this?\'94  I said \'93I don\'92t 
know, I just got to do something.  I got to make more money.\'94  In the meantime was Ruth and 
Bianca (Note: FF\'92s nieces, the daughters of her two sisters, who escaped to England on the 
kindertransport) in England and I signed up that I send every month $20.  With those teachers 
you didn\'92t make more than $40, how could you send $20.  (SF: What do you mean those 
teachers?  Oh, the ones you worked for?  FF: Yah, $40 a month.)  I went around that building a 
few times and then I went into the service entrance.  That bothered me though.  Then I went up 
and they called Mrs. Proskauer.  She says \'93Can I help you?\'94  I said \'93Yes, I saw your 
advertisement in the paper and I\'92d like the job.\'94  So she looked at me and said \'93You want to be a 
kitchen maid?  Do you realize what that consists of?\'94  I said \'93No.\'94  She says \'93You have to wash, 
you have to do all the dishes.\'94  There were no dishwashers.  \'93You have to wash all the towels 
and you have to do the chauffeur\'92s and the gardener\'92s bungalow and then we have an extra 
bungalow where my daughter and her family live for the summer.  They come from Boston and 
you have to do the dining room and the bedroom there too.  You don\'92t have to do anything for 
the children.\'94  So I said \'93I\'92m willing to do it.\'94  She said \'93You\'92re very thin and you\'92re very 
young.  Do you think you can do it?\'94  I said \'93I can do it.  I have no other choice.\'94  She says 
\'93Well, we try you out here.  We have to come for a month here to the house.  57}{\plain \super th}{\plain  Street.  You 
have to see how to wait on the table.  You have to help the chambermaid, you have to...\'94  So I 
did everything good.  I washed the dishes and I washed...she soaked it with Clorox and my 
fingers they were all red and hurting but I did it.  I think I got $75 a month.  You got tips and 
everything and I didn\'92t take the tips.  I left them laying there till they said \'93You better take the 
tips.  In (this) country they tip you so I run and got the tips.  (SF:  Who tipped you?)  They had a 
lot of visitors.  So I made about $1000 in the summer.  So that\'92s what happened.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: You stopped working for them after the summer?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  I got...then they had a chambermaid who was a terrible Nazi.  An Irish woman.  She was 
such a Nazi.  Oh, she was terrible.  I fought with her.  She used to say \'93What do you have to 
work for those rich Jews.  You\'92re Jewish yourself.\'94  I said \'93What is your husband? The chauffeur 
for Vanderbilt, and they are good Catholics and so are you.\'94  I said \'93Answer me.  You answer me 
and I answer you.\'94  She hated the Proskauers.  She just was terrible.  She hated the Jews.  She 
didn\'92t hate me she said, because I didn\'92t have anything either, but the rich ones she hated.  Mrs. 
Proskauer heard that.  There was a small bathroom near the kitchen where we always fought.  
She called me in once and she said to me \'93This can\'92t keep on anymore.  She hurts you so.\'94  I said 
\'93Yah, I answer her back.\'94  So she said there is no necessity that you have to run away from and 
get the same thing here.\'94  She said \'93She\'92s going to go.\'94  She went in and she says \'93Mary.  Here 
is your ticket.  Leave tomorrow.  I\'92ve had enough of you.\'94  She wanted to say goodbye to me so I 
said \'93You must be crazy.  You must be crazy.  You want to say goodbye to me.  The hell, I don\'92t 
care where you go.  For my part you go to hell but don\'92t you put your hand out for me.\'94 So I 
became the chambermaid.  (SF: Which was easier?)  Oh yeah, was much easier.  Then you got a 
lot of tips.  \par
}{\plain SF: You were essentially responsible for making up all the beds?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  Then I ate all that Ex-lax.  Didn\'92t I ever tell you.  I wanted chocolate.  I needed 
chocolate so bad.  They didn\'92t have any chocolate.  In every night table there was Ex-lax.  It 
looked like chocolate.  Tasted like chocolate.  So everywhere I broke a piece off.  In every night 
table.  I had about six rooms and Jeanne had about six rooms.  I said to her \'93Jeanne could you get 
me a little chocolate.  She said \'93There\'92s no chocolate.\'94  I said \'93Ex-lax.\'94  She said \'93That\'92s not 
chocolate.\'94  I said \'93Well I like it.  I need some chocolate.\'94  I said that I\'92m a chocoholic.  So she 
got me chocolate and I got me chocolate and I just couldn\'92t leave the bathroom.  I was supposed 
to serve on the table at night and I got such cramps and I just couldn\'92t work.  Oh, it was terrible. \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain I went there three times to Lake Placid.  Every time I went there I cried.  I was so homesick.  The 
chauffeur went after me.  He threw me once over...not the chauffeur.  No, he was nice.  They had 
a Canadian gardener and he threw me once over his bed.  He wanted to fall over me and I went 
back like this and he had glasses.  He couldn\'92t see without glasses and the glasses went in the 
corner.  He said \'93Get me my glasses!\'94  I said \'93For my part you can lay there day and night.  I 
wouldn\'92t get you your glasses.\'94  Then I went to Mrs. Proskauer and told her what happened.\par
}{\plain SF:  How do you spell Proskauer?  FF: P-r-o-s-k-a-u-e-r.  \par
}{\plain SF: When you were up at Lake Placid there was an accident when you hit your head on the rock?\par
}{\plain FF: You mean on the swimming.  Oh God, I nearly drowned.  That\'92s why I can\'92t swim anymore.  
I have pictures of it.  I took the daughter\'92s bathing suit because I didn\'92t have a nice one.  I had a 
European one.  I couldn\'92t afford to buy one here.  I said \'93Ooh Francis had such a beautiful 
bathing suit\'94  so the chauffeur was a very nice man.  He had two married daughters.  He says to 
me \'93Toots, go ahead.  Put the bathing suit on.  I take pictures.\'94  So I went to put the bathing suit 
on and he says \'93Go up on that rock.  It\'92s nicer when up there.\'94  I went up on that rock and those 
rocks were kind of loose,  for some reason or other.  You know, the water hit against them all the 
time.  I held like this and the rock loosened and the rock and me went into the water.  They 
thought that I was joking.  They told me I came up the third time and my eyes were all like this.  
Then the chauffeur who was dressed in his uniform, he went in with a big stick and got me out 
and threw me on the floor and I threw up water for hours and I was all night.   \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Then Jeanne slept with me because I threw up all night and I was like delirious.  I was just 
worried about the bathing suit.  If I would drowned and have Francis\'92s bathing suit on then they 
think I stole the bathing suit.  So I wouldn\'92t go across.  See we were on an island Camp Highwall 
was on an island.  Whenever we had a day off I wouldn\'92t go because I wouldn\'92t go on the boat.  I 
couldn\'92t smell water.  I had to do above where the water was, where the boathouse was, there 
was this man\'92s room on top.  You know, where the men came together and they had this, what 
you had (Note: Pool table) and all this and that was my place to clean, to keep in order.  Not 
vacuum or anything, just to keep in order.  It was above the water.  It was a beautiful room with 
leather chairs and this.  I couldn\'92t go so I made out with Jeanne who was a chambermaid.  I said 
\'93Jeanne do me a favor.\'94  No, Jeanne was the waitress.  I was the chambermaid.  I said \'93I do 
anything for you, but go down and do the boatroom.  I can can\'92t go.  I can\'92t smell it.\'94  She says \'93I 
understand.  I do it\'94 and she did it.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Did you ever hear from her afterwards?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yeah.  She came very often with her husband and her children.  She had a half a dozen 
children.  On the end it got too much for me and then she gambled(?).  He name was Jeanne 
Gristman.  She lived in New Jersey.  So, oh God, I tell you that was terrible.  Oh was it terrible.  \par
}{\plain SF: Then what did you do after the Proskauers?\par
}{\plain FF: I got married.  Daddy called me every day.  When he said four o\'92clock, then he called me 
four o\'92clock.  Mrs. Proskauer knew something happened so she called me in once and she said 
\'93Flora I hope you\'92re not going to leave us. I hope you\'92re not going to leave us.\'94  I said \'93What do 
you mean?\'94  She said \'93I understand you get calls every day and it looks like serious.\'94  I said 
\'93Mrs. Proskauer, you have two daughters.  Don\'92t you want them to be married?  I\'92m sure my 
mother would want me the same thing to do.\'94  So she says \'93Well if you leave, we wish you the 
best.  We hate to see you go.\'94  Then when I told her she says \'93Don\'92t go to your relatives.  Take 
the room upstairs.  Stay in the room.\'94  They had a triple apartment.  She says \'93Stay here until you 
get married.  You go to your relatives, you never have peace for a minute.  Stay here.  The room 
is yours.\'94  But I promised the Weils to go so I went.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did you do at the Weils?\par
}{\plain FF: They went to Florida.  A week before I got married.  Two weeks before I got married.  They 
thought that...then tante was there, Gretl\'92s mother was there you know.  She was sick.  She had 
cancer in the stomach.  I came there and they left for Florida.  In the morning the doorbell rang 
and I go on and the painter stands there.  I said \'93What do you think you\'92re doing?\'94  He says \'93I\'92m 
ordered to start painting today.\'94  I said \'93You\'92re not painting here.  I said I am here with my aunt 
and that\'92s a handful.\'94\par
}{\plain Oh, the Mrs. Weil extra gave me a tip.\'94  I said \'93I don\'92t care what she gave you, you\'92re not going 
to paint while I\'92m here.\'94  They thought they go to Florida and I do their house painting.  When 
they come back they come in a clean house.  (SF: They were wrong.)  FF: You bet they were 
wrong.  You have no idea what I went through.  You have no idea.  Yah, and then we got 
married.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Once while we were on vacation at Lake Placid you saw Mrs. Proskauer again.  \par
}{\plain FF: Yeah but she didn\'92t...she was blind then.  Yah, she didn\'92t know anybody anymore.  I think 
they had to take her to a home.  \par
}{\plain SF: I thought she invited you to the island.  FF: No.  She didn\'92t.  I said \'93Ooo, this is Mrs. 
Proskauer\'94 but they told me later on, somebody who knew them, that she was blind.  SF: What 
was the name of the island.  FF: Camp Highwall.  Well the camp was the name Camp Highwall 
but the island had no specific name.  Kate Smith was there too on that island. \par
}{\plain SF: So they owned a house there, not the whole island.  FF: No, they owned a house and a 
boathouse, and he had his horses in the city.  \par
}{\plain SF: He was a judge?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  He was a crooked judge.  That\'92s what they said.  I don\'92t know how he made it (the 
money).  She had it.  Naumberg, you know Naumberg.  Naumberg was her maiden name.  They 
have those concerts in Central Park, the Naumberg Concerts.  She came from... he wanted to 
become a rabbi.  He came from Mobile, Alabama and he wanted to become a rabbi.  They 
weren\'92t happily married.  \par
}{\plain SF: How long did you write before the letters got answered.\par
}{\plain FF: I could write because I got a, the last letter I got, when you were born (1942) because my 
father said to me once \'93If we can\'92t write to you anymore direct, we write through the Red Cross.\'94  
See he knew everything.  He just didn\'92t want to know.  So one day I was nursing you and Mr. 
Levy was our mailman.  He called up \'93Mrs. Frank, you got a European letter.\'94  I went down and 
he handed me this Red Cross letter and I fainted.  Hit my neck against the steps.  Do you 
remember on Parkside Avenue (Note: apartment was at 260 Parkside Avenue, Brooklyn, NY)  
upstairs where we lived.  (SF: on the third floor?)  FF: Second floor.  I hit my neck like this and I 
had no more blood..no more milk.  You screamed day and night and I couldn\'92t figure out what 
happened.  When I went to Dr. Wesley he says \'93You have no more milk.  What happened?\'94  I 
told him and he says \'93That\'92s what happened.  You were scared.  The child is hungry.\'94\par
}{\plain SF: So you wrote to each other for close to four years.\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  \par
}{\plain SF: From \'9138 to \'9142.  It was only at the very end that the letters were censored?\par
}{\plain FF: They were censored for a long time.  Even the letters they wrote.  They were sometimes... I 
have the letters.  I have a lot of letters.  Some of them were crossed out and some of them were 
over taped.  Taped over.  But that letter I got from the Red Cross.  That was \'9142 when you were 
born.  Well my mother couldn\'92t get over it when I told her I\'92m gonna marry.  You know my 
mother and daddy\'92s mother came from the same town.  Years ago when I was in Munich and my 
mother came to visit us, so I said \'93Momma, don\'92t you have anybody from home who you could 
visit?\'94  She said \'93Well there is an elderly couple and they very old fashioned,\'94 meaning the 
Hamburgers.  Remember the Hamburgers?  Then there is another people she says, they live near 
Augsburg.\'94  I said \'93You\'92re here in Munich.  Why can\'92t you visit them?\'94  She said \'93They have a 
lot of children.  They come from the other side of the tracks.\'94  I said \'93What\'92s their name?\'94 so she 
says \'93Frank.\'94  I said \'93Are they Jewish?\'94 because we had Frank home who were not Jewish.  She 
said \'93Yah, they\'92re Jewish.  In fact the mother was a Frank when she was single and she married a 
Frank.\'94  So she...\par
}{\plain SF: Did your family use code words or secrets?  FF: No.  (SF: Just wrote regular and they were 
censored.)  FF: Yah.\par
}{\plain SF: Did you ever write to your sisters?  \par
}{\plain FF: Sure I wrote to my sisters.  Well my parents lived with Ruth\'92s parents on the end.  They took 
them.  See I don\'92t even know those things.  They took my parents from home to a prison, and 
Herta\'92s parents too.  She Paula knows more.  Paula came later to England, but you can\'92t ask 
her(SF: Paula Seligman?.  Note: Paula Seligman was Herta\'92s sister.)  She lived in Munich. she 
lived above my sister.  My sister got them an apartment.  But you can\'92t ask her anything.  She 
can\'92t talk about it.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever write home?\par
}{\plain FF: Sure he wrote home.  We all wrote home.  I got letters from his family.  Sure we always 
wrote.  Every week we wrote.  His parents they were in a concentration camp, Bialek (Note: 
Belzec?  Bergen-Belgsen?) something near this Poland and there some distant, distant, distant 
relative of theirs, their name was Wolf and they lived in Switzerland.  We used to send money to 
Switzerland.  I said once, I said \'93Daddy, believe me I would like to go out and make money so 
you could send to your parents but they never gonna get it.  This is gonna stay in Switzerland 
with that Wolf as sure as I sit here.\'94  That\'92s what happened.  They never got it.  They made 
money those.  There were plenty of people who made money on those.  \par
}{\plain SF: They were doing what they had to, to survive.  \par
}{\plain FF: Well, in Switzerland.  You couldn\'92t be in Switzerland unless you had money there ahead of 
time.  That Wolf, I knew him from Stuttgart.  I never liked him.  \par
}{\plain SF: Do yoere any of the sons sent to America?  FF: Yah.  Simon who was in Detroit, Irving who 
you knew, Aunt Maler, and Aunt Elsie.  Those were the five living children of Aunt Regina.  \par
}{\plain SDF: Which one was your mother of the 12?\par
}{\plain FF: She was the youngest.  Oh, Tante Lorsian (sp?) that was too.  Tante Lorien (sp?)  She was 
one of the sisters too. \par
}{\plain SF: Where do Ruth and Marian come from?\par
}{\plain FF: From Uncle, I think his name was Uncle Sy.  I don\'92t know, Seymour or whatever it would 
be.  They (are) related like Aunt Salerave the dates and the numbers.  I got some answer back.  
Yah.  I got some answer back.  They told me when my mother died.  May 18.  And they told me 
when my father died.  Somehow or another they found that out.  \par
}{\plain SF: They didn\'92t have any records of your sisters?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  No.  \par
}{\plain SF: Is it possible they survived.\par
}{\plain FF: No.  No.  \par
}{\plain SF: You never checked any further?\par
}{\plain FF: I did.  With certain Jewish organizations.  I think its enough now.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Ruth came on Thanksgiving.  How did you keep track of Ruth and Bianca and how did they 
get out of Germany?\par
}{\plain FF: They sent me...when the kids came to England.  Well Bianca was first in England.  Then she 
asked for Ruth.  When they came to England they gave some address of relatives in America.  \par
}{\plain SF: Wasn\'92t Ruth on the last children\'92s boat to leave?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t know.  Could be.  Could not be. I\'92ve forgotten.  (Note: was not.)  \par
}{\plain SF: That was in what year?  FF: I couldn\'92t tell you that either.  Then, let me see, Ruth came here 
what year?  (SF: Ruth came here when I was two so it was \'9144).  FF: \'9144, and she was 12 years 
old.  She was 6 when she came to England so she was six years in England.  SF: 1938.  FF: I 
think \'9139 they left.   That\'92s what I think.  Then they had to give some addresses from whoever is 
in America and my sisters gave my address and they sent me a letter from Blumsberry (sp?) 
House which I signed, that I would support the children.  That\'92s what I had to do.  Support the 
children.  \par
}{\plain SF: You did what?  Send $10 each?\par
}{\plain FF: $10 each.  \par
}{\plain SF: How was it determined after six years for them to come here?\par
}{\plain FF: They asked for so many things.  The people she stood with.  The one Ruth stood with in 
London, they wanted parfum and nylons and all..I used to stand on line.  I didn\'92t get nylons for 
myself but I got nylons for them.  Then the color wasn\'92t right.  Then they wanted parfum.  They 
wanted all this kind of business.  Bianca was with very, very nice people.  They had no children.  
They must have been wonderful people.  Then Ruth..they were bombed out in London.  Then 
they sent them to the country and then Ruth was with this woman.  No first she was with the 
young woman whose husband was in the army and she was sleeping with a lot of soldiers.  Then 
Ruth had to go in other peoples gardens and pull down the diapers to steal diapers and she 
couldn\'92t do it so the woman threw her out.  Then she was taken to another woman, an elderly 
woman who was a spiritualist who told her that she has to become a spiritualist and she has to 
change her religion.  She wouldn\'92t do it so she locked her in a chicken coop, and Ruth nearly 
crawled up the wall.  For days she locked her in a chicken coop so, when she let her out, she run 
away.  Then the mayor took her and he went through town with her.  He say\'92s \'93I have a child 
here.  Can anybody use a child?.  Can you have a child?\'94  So this man was outside, Mr. Youth, 
and he fixed his wood shed and he says \'93Oh, give her to me.  I have 11 so I might as well as 12" 
and he took her in.  They were very good to her, but she used to have to go at night and get beer 
in the pubs and then she had frostbitten feet and frostbitten hands.  But they were very good 
otherwise to her. \par
}{\plain SF: Are those the people from Edinburgh?\par
}{\plain FF: No they are from Windsor.  I used to send them things.  God, I tell you how I used to cry.  I 
went to the post office, I packed the package and we didn\'92t have much ourselves.  Then I came to 
the post office and then the package was an inch too big on this side and a half an inch to small 
on this side and they had to send you home and you had to repack the whole thing.  You had to 
send so many things along, paperwork and ooooooo. \par
}{\plain SF: Who decided to bring Ruth and Bianca over here?\par
}{\plain FF: Well, we wanted them for the longest time but they didn\'92t let them go.  It was too dangerous.  
Then they wrote that they can go on a freighter.  Before we could answered that they can go on 
the freighter they sent us a telegram, the Council of Jewish Women, that the kids are, that Ruth is 
coming and she came on Thanksgiving.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about Bianca?\par
}{\plain FF: She came later.  I don\'92t know really know for sure. \par
}{\plain SF: How come Ruth came to you and Bianca went to the relatives in New Jersey?\par
}{\plain FF: Well, Ruth had me only as relatives and Bianca had the ones in Jersey.  Beatrice was the 
same age as she was.  Then Ida helped along right away.\par
}{\plain SF: What was the relation with the people in Jersey to Bianca?\par
}{\plain FF: It was her uncle, and she had an uncle in New York which she didn\'92t get along with.  An 
uncle and aunt she fought with them in New York.  (SF: On her father\'92s side?)  FF: Yah, yah.  So 
she went to Newark, to Jersey, to them.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: What was your reaction when Ruth came?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t know anymore, Steven.  I was scared to death to get a big girl like this.  \par
}{\plain SF: What was my reaction?\par
}{\plain FF: I wouldn\'92t know either.  She just..er...she didn\'92t know a banana, she didn\'92t know an egg, she 
didn\'92t know an apple.  (SF: She must have know what an egg was.  She was locked up in a 
chicken coop.)  They never got eggs to eat.  They didn\'92t give them to her to eat.  They sold 
everything.  They put everything into money, those people.  It isn\'92t that those people that they 
didn\'92t give her to eat.  They didn\'92t have enough themselves.  They all got it on the black market 
and if you had no connection you got nothing.  So it was bad. \par
}{\plain SF: Were we living on Parkside Avenue at the time?\par
}{\plain FF: We moved downstairs.  Before she came.  (SF: Why did we move downstairs?)  FF: We 
needed another room.  Where are you going to put a 12-year old?  (SF: So you moved because 
you knew she was coming?)  FF: Well we wanted to move anyhow to give you a room.  (SF: 
Then Ruth and I shared the room, in the front?) Yeah.  Yeah.  \par
}{\plain SF: How did Ruth\'92s coming affect the family?\par
}{\plain FF: Everybody was happy.  We were happy.  What I had the trouble with her.  You know she was 
all crippled up.  You remember that.  Then I had to have braces made for her.  (Braces to) 
straighten her out.  She was like this.  She was undernourished from not getting the food.  Her 
teeth were bad, and she was like this.  Sometimes when you spoke to her she had to look up like 
this.  See her bones were all different.  They were all so soft from getting the wrong food.  (SF:  
But she was happy to be in America?)  Yeah, she was happy.  I\'92m sure she missed England too, 
but who worried about that.  \par
}{\plain SF: The War was on and there were no bombings here.\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  Oh she used to scream bloody murder when an ambulance went through to Kings 
County (Note: name of main local hospital).  God, what I went through with her.  I tell you.  It 
was terrible.\par
}{\plain SF: What clothing did Ruth have?\par
}{\plain FF: Not much.  Daddy gave me money and I went to Macy\'92s and I bought her a dress.  I didn\'92t 
ask her which one she liked, I just bought what I liked.  Come to think of it years later, how 
wrong could be...\par
}{\plain SF: Then she started going to school?\par
}{\plain FF: They put her right away in the right class.  (SF: 12 years old, she would have gone to the 6}{\plain \super th}{\plain  
grade.  Did she go to PS 92 then?)  Sure.  (SF:  Then she went to Erasmus.)  That\'92s right.\par
}{\plain SF: Did she do a lot of babysitting?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  She did babysitting.\par
}{\plain SF: Did she go out a lot?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  She had nice boyfriends.  The girls went out and got boyfriends.  I don\'92t know.  You 
ask me things that are 30 years ago.  That\'92s a little old.  25 she\'92s married.  You know, you better 
send something on her anniversary.\par
}{\plain SDF: These are what Jewish grandmothers say and you need to keep it there so her great, great 
grandchildren can see what she was like.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SIDE TWO\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Your mother had twelve siblings, including Saler and some others.  What were their names.\par
}{\plain FF: Aunt Regina, Aunt Saler, Aunt Maler, Aunt Elsie, Aunt Sophie, Uncle Emmanuel, Uncle Sy, 
a sister and a brother died when they were young.  I don\'92t know.  I really don\'92t know.  I never 
met them.  SF: How many of those do we know other than Saler?\par
}{\plain FF: Maler, Elsie.\par
}{\plain SF: Did they come to America? FF: Yeah.  They came to America.  Er, Irving...That\'92s right.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did anyone else come to America?\par
}{\plain FF: Not from those sisters.  They died before.  Normal death.  \par
}{\plain SF: W was related.  (SF: So they\'92re from one of the 12?) Yah.  The uncles were sent to America.  
They were all sent to America when they were 13.  (SF: These were your mother\'92s brothers?)  
My mother\'92s brothers.  After they were 13 years old, after their bar mitzvah they all went to 
America.  That was Uncle Emanuel, and Ruth and Marian\'92s father, and another uncle, I forgot his 
name.  There were three brothers.  Emanuel had two sons, one who died and one...two died but 
one died when he was young and the other died as long as I am in America.  Then Marian\'92s 
father, they had the two girls, and then there was Aunt Gussie and her husband.  I forgot her 
husband\'92s name.  I forgot.  I never...\par
}{\plain SF: And they didn\'92t have any children?\par
}{\plain FF: Well, I just told you the children.  Marian\'92s father and Uncle Emanuel had two sons.  They 
died.  I just told you that.  (SF: Did they have any children?)  I don\'92t think so.  One was young 
when he died and the other one I don\'92t think he was ever married.  I really don\'92t know to much 
about that.\par
}{\plain SF: Irving and Saler and all those were from Tante Regina?  FF: Yah.  \par
}{\plain SF: She was the only one who sent all her children here?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  She was dead already when they went here.  Well Simon, who went to Detroit as an 
engineer, he studied in the Mercedes Benz, in Gargenau (sp?) in Germany he studied.  He came 
here as a young man and then he had Irving come but they never got along, so Irving went to 
Portland, Oregon and he didn\'92t get along there either so then he just went around from city to city 
and (to Scott\'97take your finger out) and then finally came to New York and that\'92s where he got a 
job with relatives, Baer, Sterns and Company.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did Simon bring the others in?  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  They came in through Hitler\'92s times, they came in.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was Saler married to Uncle Hugo at the time?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yeah.  Trudy was there already.  She was married many, many years.\par
}{\plain SF: Were all your relatives in Germany orthodox?  You said your parents were.\par
}{\plain FF: None of them.  None of them.  \par
}{\plain SF: We were the most.\par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever talk about the inflation in Germany?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  He was young yet.  \par
}{\plain SF: My father studied Hebrew under the father of the woman in Israel?\par
}{\plain FF: He went to Hebrew school like I went to Hebrew school.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did he ever study Talmud or things like that?\par
}{\plain FF: (laughing) No, no.  Daddy was far removed from Talmud.\par
}{\plain SF: Did he ever talk about Israel?\par
}{\plain FF: Well at the time, I tell you, Steven, at the time we had enough to talk about ourselves and 
getting along and making a living and working hard.  Israel was very far away.  It was that time, 
when did Israel become it\'92s own state? (SF: \'9148).  \'9148.  Daddy was still alive then.  We never 
talked too much about Israel.  (SF: Not even about the idea?) Oh yeah.  We...Daddy used to say 
\'93If I would have gone to Israel then I probably would have a farm and God knows what\'94 so I 
used to say \'93You would have to go alone because I wouldn\'92t want to be a farmer\'92s wife.  I had 
enough farming home.\'94  We never really had the things to go.  I mean to visit, yes, but it was too 
far away.  You know you still had to work with your hands and get where you were.  Don\'92t forget 
when daddy died (Note: 1953) you were 11, Ruth was 21, a few months later Ruth got sick, you 
had to go to public school, to high school, to college.  So those kinds of ideas to go somewhere 
were too far removed.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did he philosophically agree with Israel?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yah, yah.  We used to read about it and he said many times \'93What those people do, I wish 
we could do more for them.\'94\par
}{\plain SF: Did he have any relatives or friends there?  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah, he had cousins there and we wrote once to..but the letter came back and nobody could 
find them.  I don\'92t remember their name.  That was all.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about our relatives in Israel?  Do we have any?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  \par
}{\plain SF: Didn\'92t you buy some bonds?\par
}{\plain FF: Not bonds.  We gave to the Kerem Kayemet.  That was this organization where you planted 
the trees.  My father gave a lot to that.  We helped in every way we could with money.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you father help with Israel too?  What other things did he do?\par
}{\plain FF: Well that was the only thing at that time to do.  Planting trees.\par
}{\plain SF: There were groups sending young pioneers to Israel.\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, we did help.  He gave me money once.  There was one near Munich in 
Wolfratshausen.  They trained people to go to Israel.  You know, young people they trained them 
there.  They had like farming things and they need money and so, whenever I came home, he says 
to me \'93Give them some money.\'94  So he used to give me some money and then I bought meat for 
them or whatever, when I went to visit.  There was another one near Bamberg and I went there 
too and visit and brought them something.  \par
}{\plain SF: So you knew some of the people who were going?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yeah.  They wanted me the worst way to go with them.  Oh they wanted me.  How they 
wanted me to go to Israel but I just didn\'92t want to go.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were these people you grew up with?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  I had this boyfriend who went to Bamberg to this Hecha...they called it Hechalutz and 
so they invited me.  I even have pictures of...I wonder where they are...and I went there and 
visited and the one who owned the house, where they had this Hechalutz in, used to go to school 
with my father.  He had a small hotel while the others we all, ten of them, in one room.  You 
know how those camps are, those things are.  I was always there.  So my papa always said \'93You 
don\'92t go.  You just stay home with us.\'94  I used to say \'93Papa, you don\'92t have to warn me.  I 
wouldn\'92t go.\'94  I just didn\'92t like that life.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who gave you the picture of the old man?\par
}{\plain FF: He painted it himself.  He was a professor, Zeigler, in N\'fcrnberg.  He gave it to me.  He liked 
me.  (SF: When you were leaving?) Before.  Before I left.  He said to me, before I graduated, he 
said to me \'93I want you to have something of mine.\'94  When he gave it to me I couldn\'92t believe it 
because he painted months and months and whenever we came in the room he laid over like this, 
nobody should see it.  Then he gave it to me in a roll, scroll, and he said to me \'93I don\'92t want you 
to open it now\'94 he says.  \'93When you go home, you open it.\'94  He wrote a note to it too.  (SF: 
What did the note say?)  That he liked me a lot and that I was very attentive, and very accurate in 
my answers.  He just liked me.  He was a wonderful man.\par
}{\plain SF: What was he a teacher of?\par
}{\plain FF: English.  Not English.  Literature or something.  To speak right.  To you know, poems and 
things like that. (SF: What we call English?)  FF: Yah.  I wanted to say English but it wasn\'92t 
English. \par
}{\plain SF: Who is it a picture of, did he say?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  He just said a Jew prayer.  I tell you something.  For years I didn\'92t want it because it 
looked to me like a Polish Jew, a Russian Jew.  It didn\'92t look like a German Jew and I couldn\'92t 
say it.  When I opened it up once, oh, my father loved it.  It\'92s a Mizrach.  It should be hung east.  
But I wouldn\'92t even know where east is here (Note: she did have it hanging on the eastern wall of 
her apartment.)  I never know which side is east.  Is east.  East is where Israel is.  That\'92s what we 
were taught.  If it\'92s wrong then I was taught wrong.  \par
}{\plain SF: If you are here then you pray toward Israel.  If you are in Israel you pray toward Jerusalem, 
and if you are in Jerusalem you pray toward where the Sanctuary was.  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  Did you read this week in the paper (about) Goldie Hawn?  Wasn\'92t that interesting?  
She\'92s a lovely girl. \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever talk about his parents?  \par
}{\plain FF: He loved his mother dearly.  His father, he didn\'92t have too much love for his father because 
he was the one who supported the family from almost childhood on.  Everybody who came from 
Buttenwiesen used to say to me \'93You got the best.  He worked and worked and worked to 
support the family and never got anything.\'94  He always wanted a motorcycle and whenever he 
had the money ready for a motorcycle, his father started building more towards the house.  They 
had the most beautiful house in town and every time he had $150, mark ready for a motorcycle 
his father invested it in the house.  Then he had this other brother who was in Munich which I 
knew.  He was very good looking.  He went to school, he went to like real schul, business school, 
and he paid for everything.  Daddy paid for everything.  He married his sister out and he gave 
along 10,000 marks.  He made it all, as a cattle dealer more than a butcher.  He used to ride on 
his bicycle from morning till night and he just wanted a motorcycle.  But he loved his mother.  
When I was pregnant with you he said \'93I don\'92t want you to lay on the floor and do the floor\'94 so I 
said \'93Who should do it?\'94  He said \'93I do it.  I did it for my mother.\'94  I said \'93You\'92re not doing it 
for me.\'94  See he was spoiled.  He was kind of like you, like sloppy because he worked all day so 
when he came home at night his mother did everything for him.  The others sat around, didn\'92t do 
a darn thing.  They were spoiled rotten.  I can\'92t understand that.  That one person had to work for 
everybody.  \par
}{\plain SF: How did he feel about his brothers and sisters?\par
}{\plain FF: Well he liked them.  He liked them a lot.  But they were not as ambitious as he was.  One 
became a baker, in the Hitler time, and one became a businessman, Ludwig I think.  Karl and 
Ernst, I don\'92t know what the other one became.  They had to do whatever there was to do.  They 
couldn\'92t do anything else anymore.  They told them you do this and you do that, and if you didn\'92t 
do it....  You don\'92t know how lucky you are Scott, that you can pick what you want to pick.  \par
}{\plain SF: You don\'92t know what the brothers did for a living?\par
}{\plain FF: One became a baker.  I don\'92t know what the other (SF:  Which one?)  I think it was Ludwig, 
no Karl, Karl.  I\'92m not quite sure Steven.  I don\'92t know for sure.\par
}{\plain SF: Did they go away from home?\par
}{\plain FF: No, they never went away from home.  In fact, when they were supposed to go to 
concentration camp, the mother and father went with them.  They weren\'92t even told to go then, 
but they went.  But Ludwig, the younger, youngest, he was married and he had a wife and a 
beautiful boy, Paul.  \par
}{\plain SF: What was his wife\'92s name?\par
}{\plain FF: Irene.  \par
}{\plain SF: They all went to the camps?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  He was a beautiful boy.  They used to send his pictures here.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were all the brothers bar mitzvahed?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yah.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever talk about his bar mitzvah?\par
}{\plain FF: Well I tell you something.  They weren\'92t much made out of bar mitzvahs in Germany.  I 
remember this boy in our town, Josef, who used to be my boyfriend.  He had bar mitzvah so I 
was very generous.  I gave him a tie.  I still remember, I brought the tie...my mother wrapped it.  I 
said \'93You don\'92t have to wrap it up.\'94  She says \'93Yes, you do.\'94  So she wrapped it up and I went 
down and I said \'93That\'92s your bar mitzvah present.\'94  It was a silk tie. It was one thing.  It didn\'92t 
even have much shape.  But there wasn\'92t much made for bar mitzvah.  You went to the temple 
and aufgarufen (called up) and you\'92re a man and maybe you got a piece of chicken extra.  There 
wasn\'92t a big spiel made.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever say what his haftorah portion was?\par
}{\plain FF: If he did, I forgot.  Tell you the truth.  See, I tell you something Steven, the time, when the 
time came that you sit down and talk things over and keep on talking about the things, that was 
when we came to here, to Rockville (MD).  Otherwise there was always a struggle or other.  You 
know that yourself.  I got up everyday, went to work, came home at 6 o\'92clock and you were too 
tired and daddy wasn\'92t there anymore.  When daddy was alive, he left the house 3 in the 
morning.  He came home 3 in the afternoon and then he slept.  Then we ate and then he went 
back to bed.  \par
}{\plain SF: You said other people came from Buttenwiesen.  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah, yah.  I had them once.  I surprised him once and had them invited for Thanksgiving.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who were they?  FF: The Klopfers.  They died too.  Their son is a professor at Pittsburgh 
University.  I kept in touch till Mr. Klopfer died.  Hildie was a good friend of daddy\'92s.  Oh she 
really loved him.  She told me that she really loved him and that he was so good and so hard 
working and so decent.  I invited them and her mother.  Then Hildie worked in Lord and Taylor 
and I went there very often and then he came in and then we went to eat out.  He was a very fine 
man.  Then Hilda died.  She went up the steps to go to work and she couldn\'92t catch her breath.  
When she got to Lord and Taylor she looked so bad they took her to the doctor who said \'93Take 
her to the hospital.\'94  She never came home.  Then he home alone.  He was robbed twice.  He 
went to his son, to Pittsburgh, who is married to a Chinese or Japanese girl, very fine girl, they 
have a lot, I think four or five children.  That killed...suffered terrible through that.  Then two 
years ago I sent him always a package to the nursing home in Pittsburgh and I didn\'92t hear from 
him.  He didn\'92t say \'91thank you\'92 and I didn\'92t hear from him.  Then somebody who lives in Paula\'92s 
(Note: Seligman) house in Flushing, in that complex, told me that he died.  But the son didn\'92t let 
me know.  When Hilda died he let me know.  He came here.  He called me up here but when his 
father died he didn\'92t.  He probably didn\'92t know anything... His father (probably said) call up 
Flora but when he died there was no one there.  How do you know some of those old friends?  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: You said your father served in World War I.  Did my father\'92s father and family also serve?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  He served also.  He served, I think, in France.  Your father\'92s father.  That\'92s where that 
little ring came from.  Marcie has that ring.  Where I had the diamond put in.  That\'92s from his 
father.  He brought that home from the War.  I think from France.  \par
}{\plain SF: And then his mother gave it to him when he left?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  Gave it to daddy and she said he should give it to his wife to be.  That\'92s the ring I got.  
(SF:  That was your engagement ring?) Didn\'92t get an engagement ring.  Got a watch.  He 
couldn\'92t afford a ring.  \par
}{\plain SF: Your sister lived in Munich.  Did you go to visit her?\par
}{\plain FF: I was in Munich all the time.  (SF: I thought you were in N\'fcrnberg?) In school, but I was in 
M\'fcnchen for years.  \par
}{\plain SF: When were you in N\'fcrnberg and when were you in M\'fcnchen?\par
}{\plain FF: Hm, hm, hm.  I don\'92t the years I was in N\'fcrnberg.  (SF: Well how old were you?)  Twelve.  
From 12 to 16 or 17, 18.  From 12 to 16.  I hated N\'fcrnberg.  I hated that city.  They were such 
showy people.  They walked around with diamonds and with fur coats.  I hated that city, and it 
was such a dirty city because it...see, they\'92re making a lot of toys there.  N\'fcrnberg is known for 
it.  There was a saying \'93N\'fcrnberger tan gehts durch ganzer land,\'94 what they make goes through 
the whole country.  Also the lebk\'fcchen, that\'92s a specialty from N\'fcrnberg.  Then I went to 
M\'fcnchen and M\'fcnchen was entirely different.  M\'fcnchen was sporty.  You didn\'92t go around with 
all this glitter and all that thing.  That was just for me.  Not that showoff business.  Oh M\'fcnchen 
was a beautiful city.  (SF: How long were you in M\'fcnchen?)  Five and a half years.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you live with your sister there?\par
}{\plain FF: No, I worked in M\'fcnchen.  (SF:  From when you were 16?)  I think I was 18.  I lived with 
where I worked.  With the Bambergers.  \par
}{\plain SF: You liked M\'fcnchen?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh I loved Munich.  I loved Munich.  I loved Munich like I love New York.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did you do there?\par
}{\plain FF: Worked in a butcher store.  In a kosher butcher store.  Bookkeeping....\par
}{\plain SF: What did you do for relaxation.\par
}{\plain FF: Skiing and sport events and dancing and hiking and rowing with boats and did all those 
things which young people do.  It was great, M\'fcnchen.  Oh M\'fcnchen was beautiful.  I had so 
many boyfriends.  They used to call up and I used to make an appointment with one and then 
another one called up and then I fell bad that I made it up with them and then I broke it and had 
an excuse and then we went out to those boats were battling and doing things and there they were 
and got me.  They said \'93What are you doing here?\'94  Then they didn\'92t speak to me for weeks.  
You know when you\'92re young you do those kind of things.  But Munich was beautiful.  \par
}{\plain SF: Then you went home afterwards to try to get your papers?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  That was the biggest mistake I ever made.  (SF: Why?)  I wanted to be together with 
my parents.  Because the Nazis were so bad.  They hurt.  They hurt and they hit and they broke 
the windows and they, they just did everything to hurt you.  \par
}{\plain SF: It wouldn\'92t have been better if you stayed in Munich.\par
}{\plain FF: Sure.  It would have been better.  Munich didn\'92t bother you.  People didn\'92t bother you.  For 
me it would have been better but I wanted to be with my parents.  \par
}{\plain SF: Are there any stories of anti-Semitism before the Nazis?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  Not really.  There weren\'92t.  They used to call you some names.  They never called me 
names.  They were afraid of me but they used to call Ida names.  Don\'92t ever let Ida read those 
tapes.  Don\'92t ever, whatever you do, because she would feel very bad.  Because she didn\'92t have it 
as easy as I had.  Don\'92t ever let her read the tapes, or hear the tapes.  \par
}{\plain SF: So they called Ida names, anti-Semitic names.\par
}{\plain FF: Yah, oh yah.  All kinds of names.  She came to me crying so I said \'93Ok, let\'92s go.\'94  Then we 
went.  When we passed she says, she was hiding behind me, I said \'93That\'92s your whole trouble.  
You\'92re hiding behind me.  Stand in front.\'94  I took some sticks along.  As soon as they opened 
their mouth I threw the sticks.  I had a very heavy book, book thing you know where you had 
your books on (SF: Knapsack.)  It wasn\'92t a knapsack it was a real book thing.  A leather thing.  I 
took my thing off, they came near me and I hit them with my book thing over the head.  That guy 
was laying on the floor.  They were all running.  They thought he died.  I said \'93I wish he would.\'94  
When he opened his eyes I said \'93You call me again Judische stinker.\'94  He says \'93I didn\'92t call you, 
I called Ida.\'94  I said \'93Doesn\'92t make a difference.  You called us, called us a bad name.\'94  They 
never did.  They were like this.  But nobody else ever did except those.  They were really low 
class people.  Poor.  Nasty.  Lazy.  Drinkers.\par
}{\plain SF: Germany has a history of anti-Semitism.\par
}{\plain FF: We really...well I tell you...no, I shouldn\'92t say.  There was the mayor.  The mayor told me, 
when I went there for my..., he was terrible.  That came with the Hitler thing.  Before, he wasn\'92t.  
Maybe he had it in him but I never felt.  When I went there to get my birth certificate, he says \'93I 
don\'92t give Jews birth certificates.  I give them only death certificates.\'94  So (his wife) she said to 
him, whatever his name was, she said  \'93Please give Flora her birth certificate.\'94  He said \'93You 
open your mouth once more, you\'92re going to get a death certificate together with her.\'94  So I had 
to go out and I went home and I couldn\'92t get it.  Then I had to go Stuttgart to go where the 
consulate is.  To scare him.  To take a lawyer to get my birth certificate.  I tell you something, 
when I think what hard times that was.  It\'92s just heartbreaking.  \par
}{\plain SF: You talked last time when the Nazis came and threw the soup ladle through the window.  
How many times did they come?\par
}{\plain FF: While I was home they came about three times.  I saw them coming up the hill and I stood 
against the door and I ?? Like this.  My mother said \'93Please come away\'94 and I said \'93No.\'94  So 
they opened up and they pushed me in.  They said \'93Who was that\'94 and I said \'93Me.\'94  I said \'93You 
got no right in our house.\'94  He said \'93You open your mouth once more.\'94  I said \'93I do because you 
got no right in our house.  That\'92s our house.\'94   He just pushed me away ....  My mother was 
shivering.  She felt terrible.  I just couldn\'92t believe.  I could not believe that they could do those 
things.  I think if I would have stood home longer they would have killed me.  I really think so.  I 
would have killed them.  I really would have.  There wouldn\'92t have been anything too much for 
me to do.  When they broke our broke our window I said to my mother \'93I keep a piece of glass.  
They come in there I cut their throat.\'94  My mother looked at me.  She says \'93What are you 
saying?\'94 I said \'93Yah, I wouldn\'92t take a knife but that I (would) use.\'94  I think I would have done 
it.  You know, they get you so psyched up.  For no reason at all they come into your house, open 
the drawers, turn the drawers around, go through.  They didn\'92t even know what they went 
through and you stand there and watch it.  I can\'92t believe it.  To this day I can\'92t believe it.  \par
}{\plain SF: They came three times?  FF: When I was there they came three times.  As long as I was 
home.  Once they killed the dogs. Yeah, killed the dogs. (SF: Did the dogs do anything?) FF: 
They just looked.  Sure they were hollering.  They killed them right there.  (SF: How many dogs?  
Saint Bernards?)  Yah.  Two big ones.  My little one died before.  That was terrible.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did they take anything while you were there?  Confiscate anything?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t think so.  I don\'92t think so.  No.  I didn\'92t see anything.\par
}{\plain SF: So why did they come?  Just to mess up the house?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  They wanted to make it miserable for you.  Just miserable.  They said to my mother 
\'93You got nice order in your drawers.  I never seen such nice order in drawers.\'94  My mother said 
\'93Thank you.\'94  \par
}{\plain SF: So they wanted to scare them, make them leave?\par
}{\plain FF: That\'92s what do.  They want you to leave.  But where were you going to go.  You didn\'92t know 
where to go.  \'93That one\'94 he said once.  \'93That one\'94 meaning me.  I said \'93What\'92s the matter with 
that one?  That one doesn\'92t take your baloney\'94 I said.  My mother used to say \'93Kind (child) you 
have to go.  You bring yourself and us in ungl\'fccklich (unhappiness).  In schlimmazel.  (Bad 
luck).  I just...I couldn\'92t believe it.  It was not, none of the ones I knew.  They came from a 
different town.  I didn\'92t even know who they were.  They just looked like hoodlums.   \par
}{\plain SF: Uncle Leo was stopped from selling kosher meat.  Did they stop your father from dealing in 
cattle?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yeah.  Oh sure.  Naturally.  Sure they stopped him.  I don\'92t even know, I was wondering 
many times.  My parents must have lived just from the money they had in the bank.  Because my 
father couldn\'92t do any more business.  I don\'92t know.  See, you couldn\'92t say \'93Papa do you have 
enough money to live on or do you have a lot or do you have a little.\'94  You didn\'92t ask such 
questions.  I just said once to my father.  He told me that once that he has a life insurance or 
whatever that is for me, and when I am 20-something I\'92m gonna get the money paid out.  But I 
don\'92t know.  When the lawyer wrote back they said they have no papers from my parents except 
that they don\'92t owe any taxes.  So if they have no papers, how do they know that they didn\'92t owe 
any taxes?  Yeah, it was terrible.  \par
}{\plain Bianca went through a lot.  She was there much longer.  She went through a lot.  She with my 
parents.  She surely did.  Oh, what they did to that kid you wouldn\'92t believe.  She couldn\'92t go to 
school anymore in our town.  Then my sister took her to the smaller town and it was, you had to 
go a while, and then she didn\'92t come home.  She didn\'92t come home, so my sister was worried so 
she went to look for her.  There was a big thing, Easter where they rolled the Easter eggs, a hill, a 
big hill and then she heard somebody crying and she went down.  There was Bianca laying there 
all beaten up, her eyes swollen, her face swollen. She really went through a lot.  That\'92s really 
true.  She had a terrible, terrible youth.  Then my sister sent her to Munich.  Then she acted up.  \par
}{\plain SF: She went to live with your other sister?  Yah.  She says if you hit me or if you holler at me I 
going to call Hitler.  I\'92m gonna tell Hitler.  She had Kissinger as a teacher.  (SF: The father?) No, 
the uncle.  The father was in N\'fcrnberg.  The uncles were in Munich.  They were such big men, 
with such big stomachs.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: What route did you take to get out of Germany?\par
}{\plain FF: Took a train to Paris, because I had a boyfriend there.  I promised my father in his hand that I 
will not stay in Paris.  He says \'93You leave, you have to leave Europe because if its here, it might 
be tomorrow...\'94  My father was very smart.  So I said \'93Papa, if I tell you.\'94  He says \'93I want you 
to take my hand and promise me in my hand that you will go to America.  That you will not stay 
in France.\'94  He says \'93Why do you want to go to France?\'94  I said \'93I want to see my friend once 
more.\'94  They had the papers for me.  His uncle was a veterinarian in Paris and they had the 
papers for me and they were all excited that it took them so...hard job to get the papers and I told 
them I can\'92t take it.  They were religious.  (From there) I went to Le Havre .  I had so many 
flowers on the boat.  All the friends.  Boyfriends sent me flowers.  Lebring (?), he sent me 
flowers from Paris and I had some sent from Germany.  Yeah, that was nice.  (SF: What was the 
name of the boat?).  Britannia.  Britannic.  Cunard Lines, because I didn\'92t want to go with a 
German line.  (SF: When did it sail?)  I think April to May of \'9138.  I think I came here in May.  
(SF: How long did it take to get across?)  About a week and a half I think.  Maybe two weeks.  
Stopped in Ireland.  Took in a lot of those Irish.  They all looked like underprivileged.  They 
looked like such poor people.  Yah.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: When you came to America, who was here to greet you?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh God.  Herbert Winter.  The Weils.  Aunt Saler and Uncle Hugo and Trudy.  They were all 
fighting over me, where I go with.  So I went with Saler because they wrote to me last.  Gretl was 
standing there so a week after I went to Gretl.  I always had to wander, not to hurt anyone.  Saler 
they lived in Flushing at that time.  They hardly had any room.  \par
}{\plain SF: You can with one trunk and the other trunk went on another train?\par
}{\plain FF: I never saw it.  I had those big trunks.  I had one with all coats and suits which I never saw 
and I had the second one.  There was some linen in there and some clothes and then I had a 
suitcase with me yet.  You know, where I needed the clothes on the boat.  I still know some 
dresses I had made, and underwear I had made, all handmade.  When you think of it.  The ideas I 
had.  There were all made in a cloister by nuns.  They were beautiful.  Silk.  (SF: Where was the 
cloister?)  Dinkelsb\'fchl.  Had to go there.  I went there with the bicycle all the time.  (SF: So you 
had clothes made there regularly?).  No.  The clothes I had made home.  We had a woman 
coming from N\'fcrnberg and she made our clothes for all the years.  For all the years.  So she came 
before I left and made...I designed my own clothes the way I wanted.  I had really beautiful 
clothes but I never had a winter coat because the coat was in the trunk which I never got.  (SF: 
What did you wear for a winter coat?)  Hah hmm, two blouses.  I had an English tweed coat.  
That\'92s what I wore.  So I wore two blouses and some underwear, and then two years later I 
bought a coat.  (SF: How much money did you have when you came over?)  I had about 
15..$1800.  I think about $2000 from...  (SF: With you?)  No, that was sent from the Swiss bank 
(SF:  How much of that did you smuggle into Switzerland?)  About $1500.  (SF: How many 
skiing trips?)  Every time I went.  Sometimes we went four and five times a winter and 
sometimes we went three times.  That\'92s there for years.  That\'92s not there for the last year or two 
(Note: only).  That was there a long time.  \par
}{\plain (SF: You said you smuggled some out in the skis?)  All of it went out like that.  For years we did 
that.  I tell you.\par
}{\plain SF: Do you remember at all Kristalnacht?\par
}{\plain FF: I wasn\'92t there.  I wasn\'92t in Germany.  (I was) In America.  I was there before when they stood 
guard in front of the Jewish stores and didn\'92t let anyone in, and I went in, in M\'fcnchen.  I said \'93I 
want to go in you better let me go in.\'94  He says \'93You can\'92t go in.\'94  I said \'93I\'92m going in.\'94  I went 
in and then they said to me \'93Do me a favor.  Go out. You get in trouble and we get in trouble.\'94  
So the fella said to me \'93For my part you can go where you want\'94 he says, \'93but you\'92re gonna get 
hurt so you better go out.  Don\'92t do that.  You get in trouble.\par
}{\plain SF: Wasn\'92t Ruth\'92s father involved with Kristalnacht.\par
}{\plain FF: They all were.  They all were.  \par
}{\plain SF: What happened to the rest of the family?\par
}{\plain FF: Steven, I was here.  They couldn\'92t tell me.  They all were thrown in jail.  My parents were 
thrown in jail.  They all were thrown in jail.  Ruth\'92s father was in Dachau.  They were all....but I 
was here.  When they burned the temples and when they burned all the books, I was here.  That 
was the ninth of November.  Daddy was there.  That\'92s when they took daddy to a concentration 
camp.  To Dachau.  See daddy came a year later than I did.\par
}{\plain SF: He went to Dachau after Kristalnacht?  FF: Yah, yah.  They took him.\par
}{\plain FF: I tell you why we didn\'92t talk much about it.  When he came here he still had this in him, this 
fear and this thing, and the man died in his arms.  They gave them shoes to wear and the shoes 
were two numbers too small and some people said \'93I can\'92t wear the shoes, they too small.\'94  But 
they had to march all day long and the ones that couldn\'92t march they just shot.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was the man who died in his arms an older man?\par
}{\plain FF: He was an older man.  He couldn\'92t march so they shot him.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever talk about the food or the sanitary conditions or anything?\par
}{\plain FF: He couldn\'92t.  He couldn\'92t.  He used to go at night in his sleep like this.  (SF: And flail his 
arms?)  Yeah.  He couldn\'92t talk about it.  No he couldn\'92t talk about it.  He always said that.  
Somebody wanted to ask...we were once somewhere, I don\'92t know.  Yeah, we went once to New 
York somewhere.  Daddy had relatives there.  His sister\'92s sister-in-law and they were people 
there who were in concentration camps and he went out in the bathroom and he didn\'92t come back 
for an hour.  He couldn\'92t hear it.  It brought back everything.  (SF: He didn\'92t talk about the food 
or anything?)  I don\'92t know if he did or didn\'92t.  If he did I forgot.  He was in Dachau, he was I 
think for three months.  Two or three months.  \par
}{\plain SF: He must have been home for six to nine months before he came (to America.)\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  When did daddy come here.  I think he came in May.  November, December, January, 
February, March....yah, he was home maybe about six months after that.  Sure it took you a long 
time.  They didn\'92t have any relatives here to get the papers so it was very hard.  There was a 
gentile person home who had a brother somewhere, I think in Philadelphia, who also helped 
daddy with an affidavit.  In daddy\'92s town there were the gentiles, they were much, much better 
than in our town.  (SF: Do you know the name of the man who helped get him out of Dachau?).  
No.  He died a long time ago too but I don\'92t know.  (SF: Was he the mayor of the town?)  No, he 
was just a good friend of...we were friends with all the gentile people.  They were all our friends.  
We didn\'92t know any different.  I went to school with those kids, we didn\'92t even know that...you 
know, we respected them and they respected us.  Then they couldn\'92t talk to us anymore.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were there other people who I knew when I was growing up who were in the camps?  
Clothilde Lehman?  Sophie?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah she (Clothilde Lehman\'96Bianca\'92s mother-in-law) was.  No.  Sophie wasn\'92t.  Sophie was 
here long before.  Sophie came here in 1934.  You mean Sophie Rothberg.  No, she came here in 
1934.  There were the Meyers, the Meyers who daddy...that Larry, no what was his name?  I 
forgot.  He lives in Florida now if he is still alive.  He and daddy were together in the same group 
in Dachau and then they met in Prospect Park and then we became good friends again.  The 
Hamburgers weren\'92t there.  They were here already.  Uncle Leo was here already.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about the people who owned the tailor shop around the corner?\par
}{\plain FF: The Levys?  Yah, he was in Dachau too.  Mr. Levy was in Dachau too.  A lot of them Steven 
but I shocked it out of my system and now you ask me those kind of things and I don\'92t remember 
anymore.  Yah, the Levys were too.  Mr. Levy was in Dachau.  He talked many times about it, 
but he couldn\'92t either for the first few years.  Those were very, very hard times and people 
wanted to forget it, and not remember it.  \par
}{\plain SF: What sports did my father do?\par
}{\plain FF: Football (soccer).  He was very good at soccer.  (SF: Gymnastics?)  Oh yeah.  Remember he 
such a well developed body.  (SF: Did his brothers and sisters also do sports?)  He only had one 
sister.  I don\'92t know.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did he do any sports when he came over here?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, (feigned laughing) he walked from Newkirk Avenue to Atlantic Avenue to save a 
nickel.  That was his sport.  How could we do anything.  I wrote to Gretl Weil if I should bring 
my skis and she said \'93They don\'92t ski in America.\'94   \par
