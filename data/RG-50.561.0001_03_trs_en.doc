}{\plain SF: What towns were near Wittelshofen? \par
}{\plain FF: Wassertr\'fcdigen and Dinkelsb\'fchl.  Wassertr\'fcdigen was east and Dinkelsb\'fchl was west.  They 
both had train connections but we did not.  We had to get a bus from Wassertr\'fcdigen to 
Wittelshofen or from Wittelshofen to Dinkelsb\'fchl.  Ours was like sandwiched in.  A regular bus 
like we have here.\par
}{\plain SF: What towns were near Buttenwiesen?\par
}{\plain FF: Not towns.  I don\'92t know the towns.  I just know the nearest city was Augsburg and 
Donauw\'f6rth.  \par
}{\plain SF: What mountains were near you.  FF: Near us was the Hesselberg.  On top of this Hesselberg, 
it was the most beautiful mountain.  We could see it from our bedroom window.  My mother 
used to say \'93That mountain is going to bring us only schlamazel\'94 which means bad luck and it 
came to pass.  Hitler built a youth hostel there and that\'92s where they trained all those young 
Hitlers, Hitler guys, and that\'92s where Goering and Goebbels and they all came there in order to 
teach them and tell them whatever they\'92re supposed to do and whatever they should kill and not 
kill.  \par
}{\plain SF: What other landmarks were there?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t really know any other landmarks except where we lived.  We lived, our house was in 
the town and our street was called the Schloss.  That means like a castle because that\'92s where 
there used to be a castle.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father every mention any landmarks near Buttenwiesen?  FF: No.\par
}{\plain SF: Where did the other families live in Wittelshofen? \par
}{\plain FF: Through the town.  There was our best friends they lived just two seconds away from us.  
Their name was Weinschenk.  They had no children.  We were just like with Aunt Mella and 
Uncle Leo, it was just like one family.  \par
}{\plain SF: You father was a cattle dealer.  What were the occupations of the other Jews in town?\par
}{\plain FF: They were mostly cattle dealers and one they had a material store.  One he was a cattle dealer 
too but he couldn\'92t make out too well so he started with knit clothes.  (SF: So he owned a shop?)  
No.  He just went around selling it to the small towns.  He put the backpack on and that\'92s how he 
went away.  Weinschenk.  \par
}{\plain SF: What was the religion of most of the people in town?  FF: Protestant.  \par
}{\plain SF: How big was the town.  FF: about 700, 750 people.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were there other towns nearby that had big Jewish populations in them?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  The next was, as I said, Wassertr\'fcdigen and next was Dinkelsb\'fchl.  They both had 
Jewish populations.  \par
}{\plain SF: How far back can you remember the family names and where they came from?\par
}{\plain FF: As old as I am.  (SF: So just your parents and grandparents who we\'92ve recorded already?)  
FF: Yah.  (SF: One of the early Winters came from Wassertr\'fcdigen?)  FF: They all came from 
Wassertr\'fcdigen.  Only my father (moved to Wittelshofen.).  My father married my grandmother 
and married into the house and to the business.  Not my father.  My grandfather.  SF:  He grew 
up in Wassertr\'fcdigen and moved to Wittelshofen to get married.  That was Solomon?)  FF: No 
that was Falk.  Gretl\'92s father married and moved to Altdorf.  That\'92s near the Black Forest.  
Herta\'92s grandfather stood in Wassertr\'fcdigen.  \par
}{\plain SF: Where did your mother come from?\par
}{\plain FF: My mother came from near W\'fcrzburg.  From B\'fctthard.  That\'92s where my mother-in-law 
came from too.  SF: Both your mother and my father\'92s mother came from the same town, so they 
must have known each other?  FF: Sure they knew each other.  I told you that.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did the grandparents do for a living?\par
}{\plain FF: My grandparents?  In B\'fctthard?  I don\'92t know.  (SF: Your father\'92s family?)  FF: They had 
leather, like you make shoes.  They had a big business with that.  They sold leather.  SF: So Falk 
was in the leather business too?  FF: Yah, yah.  \par
}{\plain SF: What educational background did your parents have and your grandparents have?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t know any about my grandparents.  I only know that my father went to real schul  
Which is equivalent to a boys school, to a seminary.  (Note: described on a later interview as a 
\'91business school.\'92). SF: Did he apprentice at all?  FF: No.  He could even speak some English 
words.\par
}{\plain SF: What languages did they speak at home?  FF: We only knew German.  That\'92s the only thing 
we spoke.  SF:  Not Hebrew or Yiddish?  FF: No.  We don\'92t know anything about Yiddish (and 
didn\'92t speak Hebrew.)  \par
}{\plain SF: At what age were your parents married?\par
}{\plain FF: My father was, I think, 29 and my mother was 24.  It wasn\'92t arranged but everyone had to 
know where you come from and they inquired.  I don\'92t know how my parents really met.  My 
mother\'92s brother-in-law was a teacher and he wrote to the Hebrew teacher in Wittelshofen and 
asked about the family.  They said it\'92s a very good family and they are very well to do and the 
only bad part is that red hair is in the family so if you get children they might be red hairy.  
Because red hair wasn\'92t too much liked at that time.  That\'92s what I have.  That was the only bad 
part.\par
}{\plain SF: Where were your grandparents buried?  FF: In Schopfloch.  That\'92s near Dinkelsb\'fchl. SF: 
Why were they buried there?  FF: Because that was the Jewish cemetery.  There was no other 
Jewish cemetery around.  SF: So everybody in the surrounding towns went there to be buried?  
FF: Yah, yah.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was there any major, serious illness in your family when you were growing up?\par
}{\plain FF: Nobody was ever sick.  Nobody.  In fact I asked my mother, I must have been about 20, I 
asked \'93What does it feel to have a headache?\'94  We were never sick.  I don\'92t know.  I didn\'92t know 
anybody who was every sick in my family.  SF: Healthy living.  FF: Yah.  Good air.  \par
}{\plain SF: Your father was a Cohen, right?  How about your mother?\par
}{\plain FF: Nothing I think.  (SF: A Yisrael?)  I imagine so.  They didn\'92t count.  Cohen only counted.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who was the family member you thought the most colorful, the most interesting?\par
}{\plain FF: My mother.  My mother had a lot of common sense.  My mother, it seemed to, had very good 
upbringing.  She taught us things which other people never even heard of.  Even at home, every 
few years we re-did our living room, we put new furniture in.  She just had a flair for all that nice 
things.  They used to say \'93Oh God, you must have a lot of money.  Every time we come...\'94  It\'92s 
not every time.  Every 10 or 15 years.  \'93Things look so different.  They look so nice.\'94  Because 
my mother had a thing for that.\par
}{\plain SF: What kind of things did she teach you?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh, I told you.  She used to say \'93Wenn ich spar, spar ich on me selber\'94 I want to save, I save 
on myself.  And the manners.  We were brought up on very good manners.  I don\'92t know if I 
followed them but we were brought up with them.  Oh God, when I tell you what I used to do.  
Just to aggravate them.  My mother was witty and my mother was extremely charitable.  She 
always told us that.  She says \'93If you have an extra, not dollars, we had marks, an extra mark and 
someone needs what\'92s underneath the mark, you always have to keep your hand open and think 
of somebody else.  Not just of yourself.\'94  That\'92s the way we were brought up.  All the poor 
people they came to us.  My parents were away once and one of the poor guys came out of the 
bus and he asked the man \'93Where does the Winters live?\'94 He forgot from the last time.  So this 
guy said \'93The Winters aren\'92t home.\'94  He says \'93I might as well turn around.\'94  There was another, 
a Jewish schnorrer.  A baker.  I don\'92t know how he lost his...  Whatever he did I don\'92t know.  He 
used to sing very nice.  He came to us every four weeks and we wined him and dined him and my 
mother had clothes made for him and everything.  His name was Moses Mendel.  And a while he 
didn\'92t come, he just didn\'92t come.  My mother used to say \'93I\'92m so worried about Moses Mendel.  
I wonder what happened.  He must be sick.\'94  My father said \'93Write to the city\'94 which was 
Erlangen, that was near N\'fcrnberg.  So my mother wrote there and they said that he is very sick 
and he is in the hospital.  Then my mother said they should keep us posted and let us know what 
happened.  He died.  So my mother went...and that was really something to go there.  My father 
went to the cattle market in N\'fcrnberg and my mother met him and they went to the funeral.  They 
were the only ones at the funeral because he never told us if he had anybody.  Then in his will 
that all the money he has had to go to my mother.  It was a hundred marks, and my parents turned 
around and bought him a tombstone.  He used to sing so nice, I never forget that.  He used to 
come up the hill and he used to....and we came running.  We loved him like he belonged to the 
family.  He always came.  And my father was the head of the Jewish organization so we gave 
him money.  We gave him money, I mean my parents must have given him money, and the 
community gave him money.  I don\'92t know how he always go where he was, because he was 
such a jolly fella.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did the Jewish community have much money?  \par
}{\plain FF: There was a time where they did have money, Yah, but the young people moved away 
because there was no future for anybody.  Them moved away and then just the old ones were 
there and the old ones had a hard time making ends meet.  Especially at the time when the Nazis 
came.  They wouldn\'92t deal with us and so you had to live on what you had.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who was your favorite uncle or aunt or cousin?\par
}{\plain FF: I had only one uncle I liked.  The others I didn\'92t know.  See I came very late and they were 
already old.  Most of them died.  Then I had that one uncle which I liked.  He died too.  I didn\'92t 
have any uncles.  You never heard of him.  He was a teacher.  He had two sons and a daughter 
and the two sons went in the War.  I told you that in the Second World War (Note: must have 
been the First) and one was killed and one there was the end of the war and he went to the 
mailbox to mail a letter to his parents to tell them when he comes and the mailbox exploded and 
killed him too.  Then the mother... (SF: This must have been World War I).  FF: World War I, 
yah.  Then the mother, my aunt, her name was Laura.  That was my mother\'92s favorite sister.  She 
couldn\'92t eat anymore and she got sick and she got TB (tuberculosis) and then my uncle died, my 
aunt died, the two sons were killed and my aunt and then my uncle really died from a broken 
heart.  (SDF: What was his name?) FF: Leo, Leo Hecht.  They had one daughter and the daughter 
went to America.  She was a spoiled brat.  She went to America many, many years before this 
happened.  Then she didn\'92t like it and she came back and she married a man twice her age and 
we never knew what happened to her.  My mother used to say \'93I wonder what happened to that 
girl.\'94  Nobody ever heard from her.  She probably was killed too.\par
}{\plain SF: Did my father mention any favorite uncles or aunts?.  FF: No, no.\par
}{\plain SF: Did you have any heroes when you were growing up?  Anybody you read about...\par
}{\plain FF: I liked everybody.  I was a happy-go-lucky.  History was not my...  I liked music.  I liked 
theater.  Richard Strauss and those kind I went for.\par
}{\plain SF: Did you join any youth groups or clubs?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yeah.  I was the leader of Agudas Yisrael.  It was very religious.  It\'92s one of the 
religious... Agudas Yisrael.  That\'92s one of the real religious organizations.  In M\'fcnchen.  Oh, at 
home we had one girl who was very religious too and she started, on Saturday, to have those 
uh....You know you come there on lernen (to learn).  I couldn\'92t take it.  I couldn\'92t do it.  I just 
couldn\'92t do it.\par
}{\plain SF: Did you have any hobbies or collections?  I collected dolls for a while.  (SF: Who brought 
them to you?)  My father.  The Weinschenks.  Everybody who came brought me dolls.  I had 
them with those beautiful faces.  You know something, I can\'92t even remember that far back what 
I did.\par
}{\plain SF: How about sports?\par
}{\plain FF: I loved sports.  I loved skiing.  I loved tennis.  I loved anything in sports.  My mother used to 
beg me to come with a dress on and a pair of gloves in my hand and be dressed like a lady, and 
don\'92t always come with skis and boots on.  With pants and boots.  I just couldn\'92t... Ida used to go 
home all dressed up and me I came like this all the time.  I was never the dress up type.\par
}{\plain SF: How about my father with sports? He played soccer?\par
}{\plain FF: Daddy was ...yah, he played soccer and he was a what\'92s-you-call-it a physical...(SF: 
gymnastics?) Yah, he had those muscles.  He was excellent.  Excellent.  (SF: Where did he learn 
gymnastics?)  FF: At home.  You learned and you taught it yourself and he taught it to others.  
That\'92s how he got out of Dachau.  Because he was so good that to the people in town, to those 
young people, and the mayor said \'93If I can help anybody, I help him.\'94  For some reason or other 
he got him out.  SF: So he helped youth groups?  Yah.  He was very good in sports.  If you 
remember, daddy had those muscles and all that.  That\'92s why we really clicked so easily. \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Did you ever go to camp when you were young?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  We didn\'92t have to go to... we had the kids coming to us.  From the orphanage in Furth, 
we had the boys coming.  We had three boys every summer.  Ida was in that orphanage.  (SF: I 
thought Ida lived with her mother?)  FF: She had to go away too to school. She lived in that 
orphanage for many years and she had those boys, they were with her, and we had the three boys 
coming every summer and we dressed them and we bought them shoes.  They just lived with us.  
Every year we had them coming.  The same boys.  Till they grew up.  When Ida went the first 
time to Israel and she wrote to them and met them and the first thing was that he wants to meet 
me.  Then when I got there I left his address...I don\'92t know, I just never met him.  I think I didn\'92t 
want to.  It brings too much on.  They always ask the same question: why? why? And I didn\'92t 
want to answer that.  It was just too hard to answer those things.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you have any jobs around the house?\par
}{\plain FF: I should have but I didn\'92t.  I did shopping for everybody.  I rode with the bicycle like a 
lunatic.  I did shopping for everybody in town.  All the Jewish people.  (SF: Where did you 
shop?) FF: Well, for meat I had to go to the next town.  It\'92s nothing to write up, believe me, that 
town.  It was full of Nazis.  Uch, it was so full of Nazis.  (SF: What town was it?)  Gerult....  I 
forgot what the name of it.  (Note:  Gerolfingen.)  I don\'92t remember any more.  It was just full of 
Nazis.  To Dinkelsb\'fchl I went for other shopping.  I had this bicycle and I had the two bags 
hanging on there and I shopped for them and brought them everything the way they wanted.  I 
was the town shopper.  (Chuckle.)  And they never gave me anything.  Sometimes they gave me 
two candies.  But I always did shopping.  \par
}{\plain SF: How far was it to the towns?\par
}{\plain FF: To Dinkelsb\'fchl with the bicycle it took about an hour and a half.  It was uphill all the time.  I 
drove and it just didn\'92t bother me.  Going there was hard because it went up the hill but coming 
home was all down the hills.  That\'92s why I went, so I could go down the hills.  Oh, I had the 
nicest bicycles.  \par
}{\plain SF: Where did you get things like vegetables and clothing?\par
}{\plain FF: (Vegetables) In our garden.  In Dinkelsb\'fchl (got clothing.)  Then we bought the material and 
we always had a dressmaker coming twice a year to the house.  She stood with us for a week and 
she made the clothes for my sisters and myself and my mother.  After she made the dress for me 
and I didn\'92t like it, I wouldn\'92t put it on.  (SF: How about for your father?)  They had it made in 
town by a tailor.  In Wittelshofen there was a very good tailor.  There were shops, there were 
grocery shops, there were material shops, one material shop, and there was the tailor, and there 
was the shoemaker, and there was the butcher but we couldn\'92t, you know..., (SF: It wasn\'92t 
kosher?) well the one next town was not kosher either but was schect with kosher und was 
watched over with, what do you call it, those guys who come, a shomer or whatever you call it.  \par
}{\plain SF: Where did most of the relatives live in Germany, Herta, Saler, Gretl?\par
}{\plain FF: Gretl lived in the Black Forest, in Altdorf.  Herta lived in Wassertr\'fcdigen, that was a little 
city.  That\'92s where our dentist was.  I went there to the dentist.  Aunt Saler, that was different.  
That was from my mother\'92s side.  She lived in K\'fcnzelsau.  That\'92s near Heilbronn.  That\'92s near 
the Neckar.  Not far from Heidelberg.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you see them often?\par
}{\plain FF: I wouldn\'92t call often.  Once a year at least.  See the transportation was very bad.  (SF: Did 
you go to see them or did they come to see you?)  Either way.  They came and we went there.  
Never on holidays.  See my parents couldn\'92t go away because they had all those animals which 
had to be taken care of.  (SF: You had people to take care of them.)  Yeah, but you still had to be 
there.  The business had to go on.  It wasn\'92t that you took vacation like here.  You go away for 
four weeks or whatever.  They were busy too.  Aunt Saler, they were twelve sisters and brothers 
so they were busy too.  Then I had an aunt, she lived to Frankfurt and she was not nice to my 
mother, that was my mother\'92s sister and she didn\'92t treat my mother nice after her parents died, 
and I have never met her.  I never wanted to meet her.  She wanted to send me money to come to 
visit her and I told her I wouldn\'92t come.  So I never knew what she looked like.  But when she 
died, she left me $1000.  A thousand marks.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were there other relatives that I skipped who you saw?  Ones who stayed behind.  \par
}{\plain FF: Most of my family stayed behind.  Tell you the truth I can\'92t think that much.  I can\'92t...\par
}{\plain SF: What were your parents ideas on charity?\par
}{\plain FF: On charity?  There were a Jewish family in our town and they had two boys and two girls.  
The oldest son was as old as my oldest sister and then the second son we didn\'92t have anyone in 
between.  The daughter was as old as Ruth\'92s mother and the younger one was as old as I am.  As 
I was.  They had also,....they were cattle dealers.  But they lived it up.  Whatever they made they 
spent so they always got bankrupt.  Every other year they got bankrupt.  Then their relatives 
came, my father came, and they got the money together and took them out of the red.  So one 
year that her relatives, the woman\'92s relatives, said \'93I have enough now.\'94  She says \'93You\'92re 
grown up people and if you can\'92t live like everybody else and hold on to what you have, forget 
about it.\'94  So the winter came and they were really broke and they had no coals and no nothing.  
We had two maids and the man working for us.  One evening my parents they went and they said 
they go away.  I want to come along and they said no we don\'92t want anyone.  They went down in 
the stables and they took those heavy coals, there were briquets if you know what that means, 
black coals, and they filled up.  I never forget because I watched them, a big basket with coals, 
and they carried it out to them and they put it in front of the door, and then they took the basket 
home and filled it up with wood and they brought it there, so nobody should know that they did 
it, so none of the help should say we did it, you know.  That\'92s (what) they did it.  They gave 
money to people and my mother gave constantly.  There was a house in town where poor people 
lived.  I had to bring fruit there and food there all the time.  My mother fixed it so beautiful like, 
never forget, we had those high baskets and she filled it with the plums.  They were beautiful 
blue plums with the blue on it and then she stuck leaves in there.  I used to say \'93Why do you do 
that\'94 so she said \'93People shouldn\'92t think they just get it because they poor.  They should see that 
they get like everybody else, with a little beauty behind it.\'94  You know, they looked nice with 
green leaves in between the blue.  When I brought em there, she just opened the thing and poured 
them in, green or blue or whatever.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Then my father belonged in the town, he belonged in the town to all those...the school thing and 
to all that, and then I came home once and I said I fell up the stairs in that poorhouse and he 
made sure that someone went there and fixed the steps.  He said \'93Those people, those people 
have to....\'94  They were really poor, they have God know how many kids from all kinds of men, 
you know, just like here.  Then my father arranged that they have the steps fixed.  The town paid 
for that but he was the only one who saw it and I told him.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain My parents did a lot of good.  My mother went to poor people, to sick people.  It\'92s really....  
That\'92s where we learned to do the things we did, you can\'92t just take it out of nowhere.  You have 
to be shown somewhere.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: What were the typical foods you had at home?\par
}{\plain FF: All the vegetables.  I mean not (?) we eat.  Carrots, peas, cole slaw, potatoes...potatoes we 
got from the farmers.  (SF: What dishes did you make?)  We had chicken.  Chickens was a 
holiday meal.  Chicken in Germany was very expensive.  Then we had a lot of geese.  In the 
winter we slaughtered about maybe 25 geese and that was all preserved and you wouldn\'92t believe 
how that was preserved.  In the goose fat.  We had big stands like this with goose fat and that\'92s 
where the geese was in there, the pieces of the geese, and then you took it out, out of the fat, and 
you wiped it off and you had fresh goose.  We killed ten and another six and another fix and 
this....  Then had chicken.  Then the butcher came every year and slaughtered an animal for us.  
(SF: A cow?).  Yah.  A young cow.  A calf.  Then we gave to the other Jewish people too.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: What did you have normally for breakfast.\par
}{\plain FF: Cacao, a piece of cake.  Yeast cake.\par
}{\plain FF: Lunch we had the main meal.  We had meat and we had potato salad and meat with some 
sauces, and vegetable and salads.  Dessert you only had on Shabbos, Friday night and Shabbos.  
That was the difference between every day and Yontif.  Then we had soup all the time and we 
had a lot of potatoes.  My mother was a fantastic baker.  We had big cans like this with cookies 
all the time.  Cakes.  Then we had fruit.  Oh, did we have fruit.  Did we have trees.  We had pears 
this size, apples and then we took them down like you have, to preserve them.  Then in our cellar 
we had those big closets and pulled out a thing like a drawer, and that\'92s where we had the apples 
in and the pears.  (SF: How did you keep them from spoiling?)  I don\'92t know how but they were 
in those wooden things and they never spoiled.  I mean you had to go down and go through it 
quite often in order to see but they lasted the whole winter.  We never bought an apple.  We 
never bought fruit.  Plums my mother preserved.  We had glasses and glasses of all the fruit.\par
}{\plain SF: What did you do for dinner if lunch was the main meal?  \par
}{\plain FF: Evening you mean?  Oh, you had potatoes and herring or scrambled egg and uh...you had a 
lot of fish.  Fish was very cheap and easy to get.  You had a lot of herring.  You made a lot of 
stuff out of herring.  Lox.  (SF: Although you were inland, fish was easy to get?)  Yah, yah.  Like 
Uncle Leo said, they never had fish. (Note: Leo Kalberman lived in Mannheim but grew up 
elsewhere.)  Fresh fish we had, carp and things like this.  We had them very easily.  We bought 
them but they were very easy to get.  We had water around where they got fish but I don\'92t know 
what kind of water.  You know when you are young like this, and when I got older, then the 
trouble started so that was the least of your worries.  \par
}{\plain SF: How did the holidays differ from regular meals? \par
}{\plain FF: Oh, you had noodle charlotte.  You had matzoh balls.  You had other soup.  You had green 
kern soup.  You had big pieces of meat.  You had everything.  Pot roast and all those kinds of 
things.  Then we had pigeons.  Then we had young lamb.  Oh were they good.  My mother never 
ate a piece of lamb but she knew how to make it.  When we had the pigeons each one got a 
pigeon.  They were like this and then they were stuffed and ohhhhh.  When I was 16 then I got a 
whole one.  Otherwise I just got a half one.  I couldn\'92t wait until I got a whole one.  Oh those 
pigeons they were good.  Ohhhh.  Then stuffed breast of veal.  Veal wasn\'92t that expensive either.  
(SF: That was on the Jewish holidays?)  Yah, or on Shabbos could be too.  Shabbos was always 
treated like a holiday.  Friday night and Shabbos. \par
}{\plain SF: What were your favorite foods?\par
}{\plain FF: Meat.  Meat and chocolate.  My mother told me to marry either a butcher or a chocolate 
manufacturer.  That\'92s the only thing that keeps me (will keep you) going she used to say.  SDF: 
Chocolate all the way!  \par
}{\plain SF: What was the town synagogue like in size, shape, location?\par
}{\plain FF: It was very big.  It was big.  I think I even have a picture of it.  It was made for years, I don\'92t 
know for how many hundred of years before when they needed it, and then it was empty.  SF: 
Was it wooden?  FF: No.  It was stone.  It had windows that were like this (SF: Arched.)  And it 
only had in front there at the bimah they had you know the lions and that was in stained glass.  
(SF: So the Bimah was up front, it wasn\'92t in the middle?)  No it was up front.  The men\'92s seats 
were on the bottom and the ladies seats were upstairs.  It was like wood around like this.  It was 
like a design in it.  You could look down and see the people (SF: and the people could look up 
and see you.)  Yeah.  They wouldn\'92t dare do that but they could.  SF: Do you know when the 
synagogue was built?  FF: No.  No idea.  SF:  Did it have any art work in it?  FF: No, I don\'92t 
think so.  It didn\'92t look like...  There was a synagogue in a small town about maybe an hour and a 
half away.  That was, they said, at that time that it was the oldest synagogue, I have pictures of it, 
in Germany.  That was called Bechoven.  It was made out of wood and everything was written on 
the wood.  Prayers and everything.  It was just beautiful.  (SF: Was there anything written inside 
your schul?) No, no.  \par
}{\plain SF: What was the family role in the schul?  Was your father president of the schul?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah, forever.  Forever.  \par
}{\plain SF: Do you remember the rabbi?\par
}{\plain FF: We didn\'92t have one.  I told you the rabbi we had, who was gay, who came from Ansbach.  
The rabbi came every year, from Ansbach, during the year.  He had to check us in Hebrew.  You 
know, ask questions and the like, tests.  He was not a married man and he was a very good 
looking man.  His name was Dr. Brader.  Whenever he came, I was six years old when my sister 
got married, I run out and run to my sister.  I wouldn\'92t stay in the same house with him.  My 
mother said... So he said to my mother....yah he stood in our house.  He was such a wonderful 
speaker that when he came and spoke in the temple the minister came, the teachers came, 
everybody came to listen to him.  He had a voice, he was just a great man.  That\'92s what they 
thought.  Whenever he came I run out.  He used to stand like this and I run under the thing and 
run out so he said to my mother \'93What\'92s wrong?  Whenever I come, that little one runs out. 
Doesn\'92t she like me.\'94  My mother said \'93I never asked her really\'94 so my mother said to me before 
he came \'93If you stay home, why do you run out?\'94  I said \'93I don\'92t like him.  I don\'92t want him to 
touch me.\'94  My mother said to me \'93If you stay home, I buy you anything you want.  I buy you a 
new bicycle, I buy you...\'94  \'93I don\'92t want it.  I don\'92t want to stay in the house.\'94  I run to my sister 
like crazy.  She knew.  She says \'93Oh, Dr. Brader came?\'94  That was it.  When he came and he 
made a speech and he came to eat, I\'92m sure I sat like this so when he gets up he wouldn\'92t touch 
me.  I don\'92t know.  I was six years old.  So then my parents looked at him and everybody.  They 
just thought he was the greatest.  One day my father came home from the cattle market.  Usually I 
run down and I greeted him and he opened his little satchel and he gave me chocolate and he 
always bought me chocolate with coconut.  I liked that the best and he gave it to me and I hugged 
him and I said \'93Papa, don\'92t you feel good?\'94  He says \'93Yah.\'94  I said \'93Don\'92t you like me?\'94  \'93Oh 
yah, I like you.  I have to speak to momma.\'94  So he came up and he took my mother and he 
talked to her and they all got red in the face and they went in the room.  I stood there and I 
listened on the door and I heard them talk about Dr. Brader, Dr. Brader.  Then when my mother 
came out I was gone already, and I said \'93What\'92s wrong with Dr. Brader?\'94  My mother said \'93You 
wouldn\'92t understand.\'94  Well, Dr. Brader was caught with a soldier and they found out that both 
were gay.  The soldier was arrested and he (Dr. Brader) fled.  They thought he fled to 
Switzerland.  I grew up....it was just a terrible shame.  It was over all the papers and he was such 
a prominent man and everybody looked up to him.  The little city of Gunzenhausen, of Ansbach 
where he was, they were heartbroken.  They couldn\'92t believe to them.  In years later it was 
forgotten.  We got a new rabbi and it was forgotten.  I was with people in Switzerland, we went 
skiing, and we were very religious and we only ate in...they had very few Jewish restaurants but 
they had vegetarian places.  We got in those vegetarian places.  We sat down, I never forget it 
was a big round table like this, and I look up and I said \'93My God, there is Dr. Brader.\'94  He turned 
like this and run out.  I wanted to run after him.  I don\'92t know what I wanted to run (laughing) 
and they held me back and this friend said to me, he says \'93How dumb can you be?  He heard 
your name, he heard his name and he run and you want to run after him.  What do you want?\'94  I 
sat there.  I just couldn\'92t believe.  It was the same man.  The same tall, heavy man.  He looked the 
same.  And I wanted to run after him.  That was our rabbi.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain He was replaced by a rabbi, Dr. Munk.  That\'92s Tanya\'92s uncle (Note: Tanya SF believes is the 
wife of Jack Kantal, son of Hella and Sol Kantal.)  (SF: Who officiated at services?)  We had a 
teacher.  Lehrer Sommer.  His name was Sommer.  He taught us every day.  We had to go direct 
from public school to Hebrew school.  From, I don\'92t know anymore.  I couldn\'92t tell you anymore.  
Eight till one or twelve, I don\'92t know.  Then we went direct from there to Hebrew school.  (SF: 
How long were you in Hebrew school?) Two, three hours every day.  (He taught us) the reading, 
the history, everything.  He was a very good teacher but he died.  He was a nasty man too.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did your father go to schul every day?\par
}{\plain FF: They went every day.  As long as they had minyan they went every day.  My mother didn\'92t 
go.  My mother went Shabbos.  (My father went every day) as long as they had minyan.  I was 
away already.  I couldn\'92t tell you.  I was away already and they didn\'92t have minyan anymore and 
came the holidays they we got either the boys from somewhere else or whoever came and we 
hired and paid....(SF: But they wouldn\'92t have a service without a minyan?) No. No.  That was 
very hard for the people.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: How far was the schul from your house?\par
}{\plain FF: No far.  Ten minutes.  You just walked out the town and up the hills.  \par
}{\plain SF: Sigbert had a Bar Mitzvah?  FF: Yeah.  SF: Do you remember it?  Did relatives come from 
all over.  FF:  No, just from the small community the family came.  They brought the tie as a 
present, and the pen as a present.  (SF:  Herta and Saler wouldn\'92t come?)  FF: No, no.  They 
weren\'92t invited.  They had a lot of kids of their own and they didn\'92t....  It wasn\'92t like that.  It was 
like years ago here.  The elderly people here they said they never heard of such big things.  When 
you speak to elderly Jewish people they say \'93We didn\'92t have that.  We went to temple and came 
home and that was it.\'94  Like Richie, Ruth\'92s (Note:  FF\'92s niece) first husband, he had his bar 
mitzvah on Thursday.  They went to the temple and went home and that was the bar mitzvah.  
They didn\'92t have it like this now.  It was strange to me too when I came over.  I remember that 
boy in our town who had bar mitzvah and I went down I brought him a tie.  I still know the color 
of the tie.  A striped tie.  That was the present.  Then you got a piece of cake and a cup of coffee.  
No, there wasn\'92t a big thing done.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did your parents give Sigbert?  FF: Gold.  Gold pieces.  That I remember.  A lot of gold 
pieces.  How many I don\'92t know.  Ginny (Note: wife of SF) got a gold piece?  Remember (Note: 
Ginny has a gold piece that was sent to SF by a German friend of FF, for SF\'92s bar mitzvah.)  \par
}{\plain SF: Do you remember your sister\'92s weddings? \par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  When my older sister got married I was 6 years old.  I had to stand up there and make a 
speech.  I got two pigeons, two paper mache pigeons and I had to say a poem how those pigeons 
love each other and this and I couldn\'92t stand it but I had to do it.  That was in a hotel.  That was a 
beautiful wedding.  In Gunzenhausen.  That was the only Jewish hotel in the whole 
neighborhood.  Strauss in Gunzenhausen.  I remember that.  That\'92s where we went and we stood 
overnight and it was a big thing.  (SF: A lot of people came?)  Yah.  I don\'92t know how people 
came from out of town but there were a lot of people there.  When Ruth\'92s mother got married, 
she said she wanted to be married at home so she got married at home.  Then we had somebody 
who cooked.  We had ducks that time, I remember that too.  That was a nice wedding too.  I used 
to say then already \'93Momma, that\'92s not going to happen to me.\'94 \'93I don\'92t have this kind of 
business\'94 I said.  \'93Not with all those people.  That\'92s not for me.\'94\par
}{\plain SF: When Ruth\'92s mother got married where did people stay?  \par
}{\plain FF: There\'92s a hotel, there were two hotels in our town.  They weren\'92t called hotels.  They were 
called gasthof.  They gave beer and dinners and they had a lot of rooms upstairs.  That\'92s where 
they were.  We had a big house.  I remember Ruth\'92s parents they went away the same night.  
Where they went on their honeymoon I don\'92t know.  I don\'92t know where my other sister went 
either.  Look I was so young I didn\'92t know those kind of things.  Never asked.\par
}{\plain SF: Did any of your relatives get into the reform movement? No.  Uh, yah.  Not in...there was no 
movement.  They just kept less and less and less.  Where Saler came from they weren\'92t that 
religious at all.  I mean they kept the holidays and this but I don\'92t think they were that religious.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about my father\'92s family.  \par
}{\plain FF: They were not that religious either.  They also kept the holidays...\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SIDE 2\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Was there a newspaper in town?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh yeah.  We had the Frankfurter Zeitung (Frankfurt Newspaper) and the W\'f6rnitz Boden, 
that was the water which went through our town was the W\'f6rnitz.  (SF: Was that a stream or 
river?) FF: It wasn\'92t a real river, it was sometimes in the winter from snow when it run over, boy 
it had half of the town in trouble.  It never hit us because we were up the hill.  (It was) pretty 
wide, pretty wide.  There was a bridge over it and the other side was the other side of the tracks.  
I never even came...very seldom came there.  \par
}{\plain SF: There was a Jewish paper too?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  Oh, yah.  There was the Familien Platt, Family Paper, that came from Frankfurt.  That 
came every week.  Every Friday.  When the town was prosperous, when the Jewish people were 
prosperous, my father had the Frankfurter Zeitung, that almost like the Wall Street Journal, and 
we had the W\'f6rnitz Boden, and we had sometimes the N\'fcrnberger Zeitung.\par
}{\plain SF: Was your father a Hebrew Scholar?  Did he study Talmud?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  He knew but he didn\'92t study.  Nobody in the town studied.\par
}{\plain SF: How about your grandparents?  \par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t think so but I didn\'92t know them.  I only know my grandmother which I didn\'92t like.  \par
}{\plain SF: What were your parents\'92 likes and dislikes?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t know.  My father was a businessman through and through.  My father couldn\'92t tie his 
tie.  My father didn\'92t know where his handkerchiefs were.  My father was everything handed (to 
him).  When my father came home we stood on the door and my mother wiped his head, he had 
no hair like Uncle Leo, and I put the cap on.  Then he had to take his jacket off and my mother 
hanged it up.  My father was a businessman through and through but otherwise he didn\'92t know a 
thing.  Like my mother used to say \'93As much as I love papa, but I hope if the time comes that 
papa dies before me.\'94  I used to say \'93How could you say that.  I thought you love...\'94  She said 
\'93Yes, because I love him so much. Nobody would take care of him the way I do.\'94  That\'92s the 
truth.  He was spoiled.\par
}{\plain SF: Did he dislike anything in particular?  FF: He never said.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about your mother?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  My mother didn\'92t like gossip and my mother didn\'92t like when people complaining about 
others.  She used to say \'93Stay away.  Why aggravate each other.\'94  She was always there to have 
peace.  \par
}{\plain SF: What was your parents greatest source of pride?\par
}{\plain FF: The children, and the grandchildren.  And me, I must say me.  My father used to say \'93I 
wouldn\'92t give you away for a million dollars\'94 and my mother used to say \'93Who do you think 
would want her?\'94  But he used to give me anything and everything.  When he came home 
sometimes and business was bad he used to say, he always said \'93Sit over there.\'94  He just looked 
at me and that made him happy.  That\'92s the spoiling he did.  See he could never see any wrong. \par
}{\plain SF: Was there anything they were ashamed of?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  We never did anything to...ashamed of.\par
}{\plain SF: Was there a schul in Buttenwiesen?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  You met the woman in Israel who her father was daddy\'92s teacher.  Sun.  There was a 
schul there.  There were more Jewish people than by us.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was the family, like your father or grandfather or your mother\'92s parents, do any military 
service?\par
}{\plain FF: My father was in the First World War four years.  And Bianca\'92s father and Ruth\'92s father.  
Ruth\'92s father was in Russia.  Bianca\'92s father was in Macedonia wherever that is.  My father was 
in Grafenwere (?) and then he was in France, in Lille or something.  (SF: Did he ever talk about 
it?).  He used to say how some people stole the people blind.  He never...in fact when they came 
home, my mother used to tell that.  I didn\'92t know.  When they came home they could keep the 
uniform, the long coats and the long things and my father said \'93Give it away.  I don\'92t want to see 
it anymore.\'94  But those people who I was telling you before, who never had anything, who were 
always bankrupt, he brought home diamonds and he brought green velvet, I never forget, and he 
brought everything.  He just robbed the people blind.  You know, in France, the ones who 
because Germany because they went through, I don\'92t know really how that happened.  My father 
said \'93No, I don\'92t want to get rich on other peoples trouble.\'94  Never did.  \par
}{\plain SF: You grew most of your own vegetables and fruits.  Did you have your own vineyards too?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  We had some but they were so small that they weren\'92t... (SF: Who did the cultivating?) 
FF: Our man.  \par
}{\plain SF: What clothes did you normally wear?  A dirndl?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah, I wore a dirndl.  I wore dirndls.  I was very thin so not everything fit me.  The dirndls 
you could tie up here, the vests and this.  I had a lot of dirndls and they were beautiful.  Then for 
Shabbos I had a regular dress.  A silk dress or anything like that.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about my father?  Did they were lederhosen or regular pants?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  Regular pants.  They wore regular pants. \par
}{\plain SF: Who wore lederhosen?\par
}{\plain FF: Sigbert, my sister\'92s... I bought him the lederhosen for the summer.  The kids when they were 
young they wore lederhosen.  (SF: Adults didn\'92t wear lederhosen?) FF: In Munich they did but 
not where we were.  Because that\'92s where they all wore them all the time.  (SF: That was the 
style?) FF: Yah.  I mean you didn\'92t go to work with those.  Like you wear them now, when you 
come home from work you change.  Or they were out in the fields they with lederhosen, things 
like that.  \par
}{\plain SF: Can you draw a diagram of your house?\par
}{\plain FF: Our house was outside like this.  Very heavy.  Stone.  For years, you know, the Nazis broke 
the windows.  They didn\'92t let put any of the glass.  There was no one there who would put glass 
in so we had to put paper, from a box-cardboard in.  On the outside of the house it was so 
neglected.  My mother used to say \'93I don\'92t want to go out.\'94  It was so neglected.  Because it 
needed to go over because it was up on the hill and the wind (Note: said winnnnd with 
inflection), you know.  Nobody could do anything so half of the wall was...it was a terrible thing, 
it was just an awful thing to see.  \par
}{\plain FF:.... because they got old and couldn\'92t climb stairs.  So that was my grandmother\'92s room.  It 
was a small room off the living room, to the left.  When my grandmother died, then we had a 
desk in there and a sewing machine in there.  It made it very comfortable.  It wasn\'92t that small 
but it was a nice room.  Then you came out from the living room and then you went...that was the 
hall, then you went here and there was the kitchen.  The kitchen was big. (SF: Across the hall 
from the living room?)  FF: No.  It was this way, toward the front.  This was the kitchen and the 
kitchen had two buffets, one for milchdich and one for fleishdich.  There was a stove and the 
stove was beautiful.  It had a what-do-you-call-that?  The top was shiny like a...  It was always 
polished.   There was a big kitchen table in there and from the kitchen you went into what we 
called the schpice.  That was...that came up from the cellar, the coldness came up from the cellar 
and there was all out of stone.  That\'92s where...it was cold like ice in there too.  The coldness 
came out from the cellar somehow or another.  It was built on top of the cellar.  Then in the 
corner my mother had a big closet like with screen and that\'92s where we had our food in there.  
You didn\'92t have a frigidaire or even ice, we didn\'92t have that.  That were the food in there.  Then 
you went back there from the hall and there you went down the cellar.  Back here was a big room 
where we had our working clothes.  The men had their shoes there.  You know, you came up 
from the thing.  The shoes and we had the big thing where we all had the shoes, the working 
shoes, and the girls had the closet there.  They had their clothes there.  What was in the closet.  I 
don\'92t know.  My father\'92s working clothes.  Then there was the bedroom, one bedroom.  No then 
there was the bathroom and there was the bedroom.  The bedroom was first for my sisters 
because it was big and they got married so I got it.  It was a nice sized bedroom.  It had two beds 
in there and they had a thing in there to wash your hands and all that.  It was nice set.  Then you 
went upstairs.  There was my parent\'92s bedroom.  Then there was another bedroom.  Then there 
was a room where you had a big thing where you had your flour for the winter.  Next to it was 
another way we had...I don\'92t even know what was in there.  Then there was the \'93gutte zimmer\'94 
(good room) they called it.  It was a beautiful room with red velvet furniture in there.  Then there 
was a buffet that was just beautiful.  Next to this was another room like a guest room and there 
was a big closet in there with mirrors and clothes, where we hung the clothes.  Then upstairs 
were the maids rooms.  (SF: You lived downstairs and the maids lived upstairs?)  Yah, on the top 
floor.  \par
}{\plain SF: Where did the people who worked on the farm live?\par
}{\plain FF: In their own houses.  The man who worked for us, he lived above the stables because 
somebody had to live there in the winter.  (SF: You had several people who worked for you?).  
FF: At times.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Phone rings, interrupting discussion, which picks up at a different point. \par
}{\plain SF: Camp?\par
}{\plain FF: No her husband was...  \par
}{\plain SF: When did get a telephone?\par
}{\plain FF: I don\'92t know.  It was there all the time.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you have any other appliances?\par
}{\plain FF: Electric iron.  We had the electric iron.  See Uncle Leo could remember that they didn\'92t have 
electricity but I don\'92t.  We had electricity all the time.  Then we had some other irons which you 
put on the stove to get hot and to iron with.  Then we had the carpet sweeper.  That was really 
something to have a carpet sweeper.  (SF: A vacuum?) FF: No a carpet sweeper. A regular carpet 
sweeper for the rugs.  Well, we had electricity all through the house.\par
}{\plain SF: What style of furniture did you have?\par
}{\plain FF: Modern.  We had beautiful furniture.  Like this.  We had in the living room we had a buffet 
and we had where you came in we had a stand where we had a big palm tree.  Then we had a 
buffet and we had like a credenza on this side and then we had the sofa here and then we had 
leather chairs.  \par
}{\plain SF: The furniture was made by somebody?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah, they were made locally.  Lately they were locally but I don\'92t know where the buffet we 
had downstairs...\par
}{\plain SF: Where did the family buy steins and silverware and those things?   \par
}{\plain FF: They had it all.  We had it all the time.  In the city I imagine.  The steins you probably bought 
from the farmers when you saw them.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did you do for transportation?\par
}{\plain FF: We had the bus who came through the town three times a day.  Then we had the horses and 
the wagon.  (Sf: The bus went between the little towns?)  FF: Yah, from Dinkelsb\'fchl...from 
Wassertr\'fcdigen from the train to a small town, to our town and then to Dinkelsb\'fchl.  You could 
go on the train here and my father went to N\'fcrnberg, to the markets so he took the bus or 
sometimes the man brought him there with the two horse...with the horse.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you ever ride horseback.  \par
}{\plain FF: I didn\'92t go near a horse.  They scared me to death.  SF: How about your father?  FF: He 
didn\'92t drive either.  The man drove.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you or your father take trips to other cities?\par
}{\plain FF: My father went every week to N\'fcrnberg, that was a trip, that was with the train about three 
and a half hours.  (SF: That\'92s where the cattle market was?)  FF: Yah, and Dinkelsb\'fchl had a 
cattle market about once a month.  And N\'f6rdlingen and Donauw\'f6rth.  That\'92s how he knew 
daddy.  Our daddy knew my father from Donauw\'f6rth, from the cattle market and from 
N\'f6rdlingen from the cattle market.  \par
}{\plain SF: What happened at these markets?  Did people just make paper transactions?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  You transferred your animals there.  We were the only ones in town who had a truck.  
My father had a truck made where you put the two horses on and you transported the animals 
(SF: You mean a wagon?) FF: Yeah, a wagon and you transferred the animals to the train and 
then it was transferred to the city. ( SF: My father did the same thing and that\'92s where they met?)  
FF: Your father didn\'92t.  Your father bought em.  He bought them to take them home and 
slaughter them.  \par
}{\plain SF: How did the family make the money originally to buy the schloss?\par
}{\plain FF: (Laughing) You got a good question.  I have no idea.  This was my grandmother\'92s name.  My 
grandmother was...\par
}{\plain SF: Do you want to read the article now and translate it?  \par
}{\plain FF: It says here: When there were anymore Graffen and ... their title was taken away and they 
fought each other.  Those herren.  Whatever they were.  When this was taken away, the 
Margrave, then they lost all their money and then they had to sell it.  The family Schlossheimer 
and Monheimer.  Schlossheimer was a cousin of my grandmother\'92s.  My grandmother\'92s maiden 
name was Monheimer and they took this over, the schloss besitz (possessed) for 1800 gulden.  
That\'92s what they paid them for.  1800 gulden.  It was 1856.  Wittelshofen ,130 years ago, at night 
from the 13}{\plain \super th}{\plain  to the 14}{\plain \super th}{\plain  of May, 1856 the fire alarm came.  The Margrave...and the schloss stood 
in flames.  The fire came from all sides that they couldn\'92t save it.  It was burning and they came 
from all the surrounding towns they came with fire equipment.  Nine fire sprayers came and only 
two could come nearby on account of the high elevation.  It was high up.  They didn\'92t reach up.  I 
always told you our house was up on the hill.  The burning took from May 14, 12 in the 
afternoon till May 16.  They had fights with each other.  The Margrave and the other one.  You 
know all those people, they lived on the peoples land and the people had to bring all the food in 
and support them and they lived in...they had to work for them for nothing, bring the food in for 
nothing, bring the wine and the beer, and they lived up to it and the other people starved and they 
got tired of it so they through some flames in and burned down the whole thing.  They had a hard 
job that they (the Margrave?) got away from it.  They would have killed them too.  They were 
always killers you know.   1300.  In the year 1300 came a man, 13 hundred eighty were that one 
thrown out and another one came in.  He sold it to someone in Dinkelsb\'fchl.  (SF: So it was built 
in 1300 originally?) FF: Yah.  Then came something else.  In 1426 came another one who owned 
it.  Ninety nine years.  Ninety nine years they had the man in Ansbach who took care of, who 
owned it this place in Wittelshofen.  Then in 1520 finally he could call it his own.  Again it 
started like this that they took everything from the people and then... That\'92s also a town.  1525 
they also came and sturmed against it.  They shot against the thing.  They just didn\'92t take this 
being fooled anymore.  Then they built it up again.  35 rooms and three rooms for...where you 
have the big parties in it, what do you call it?  Three ballrooms.  They put that thing around the 
walls.  Those water...  (SF: A moat?)  FF: But they was just small things.  It was floating around 
but there were small things.  On both sides were trees and there was water going through.  That 
went around the houses.  We had a lot of trouble with it.  There were stones in there and we had 
to clean them out.  He thought that\'92s going to help.  He built 35 rooms with three of those 
ballrooms and the zehnten (Note:  tithe).  That\'92s the one who is still standing.  That\'92s call zehn.  
They had to give a tenth of all their earnings and all their fruit they had to bring there.  So those 
big shots could just live on that.  They didn\'92t have to worry and work about it.  They just took 
whatever they could get.  And they got tired of it and they burned it down again.  That place was 
burned down more often than anybody ever....\par
}{\plain SF: But if they had 35 rooms on the same property you had your house on...\par
}{\plain FF: We had four houses built there.  Four houses.  \par
}{\plain SF: Article is from a May 13, 1986 FLZ.  \par
}{\plain FF: Let me tell you something.  Our house was built on the ruins of the schloss but the 
surrounding, the grounds belonged all to the schloss and that\'92s where the other houses.... We 
didn\'92t own them.  We only owned the grounds.  We owned the trees and we owned the gardens.  
The houses were built from the Monheimer and the Schlossheimer and they must have sold the 
houses to those people but our house was ours and the one opposite us, was just almost like here, 
belonged to ...but this house on 1936 or 38 or 34, they don\'92t go that far, see.   \par
}{\plain   \par
}{\plain SF: You said your father knew my father.  What did he have to say about my father?\par
}{\plain FF: Steven.  Listen.  Let me explain.  Your questions some of them are so ignorant.  I have never 
spoken to my father since I got married.  \par
}{\plain SF: But he wrote to you after that. \par
}{\plain FF: Daddy said, our daddy said he knew my father when I explained to him what my father 
looked like.  So he said he knows my father, he remembers my father.  He had a little red hair 
here and he knows my father.  My parents couldn\'92t write.  They wrote through the red cross to 
me.  What are you talking?  So I\'92m going to ask him how he likes daddy when he never spoke to 
him?  I don\'92t know.  Hella says the same thing.  I want to tell you something.  When I was 
young....\par
}{\plain SF: Was the family in any kind of politics?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did any of them talk about Israel?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  My father just said once a year \'93lashonah habah berushahlayim\'94 (next year in 
Jerusalem) and I said \'93I don\'92t want to say it because I don\'92t want to go there.  It\'92s good enough 
for me here and I don\'92t want to go to Jerusalem.\'94  He used to say \'93That\'92s what written here and 
you read it.\'94  I said \'93I don\'92t want to go, why should I read it?\'92 \par
}{\plain SF: Were there any Zionists in the area?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  He always said... He says....then he always said he would love to go to France to-what is 
it called?-the Forgesen(?), that\'92s a mountain in France.  He always said \'93Ooo, I would love to go 
to see that once in life.\'94  He would have enjoyed that.  Oh would he have enjoyed that.\par
}{\plain FF: Scott don\'92t, God forbid, don\'92t drop it.  Don\'92t play around with it.\par
}{\plain SF: Did the family take trips together or go on vacations?\par
}{\plain FF: They couldn\'92t take it together.  My father came to Munich or my mother came to Munich.  I 
told you about the animals.  Always somebody....even it you had help you still had to be there 
to...\par
}{\plain SF: Did you or your sisters ever go with them?\par
}{\plain FF: They lived already in Munich.  My sister lived in Munich. (SF: How about when you were 
younger?) Yeah, I went with my father and with my mother.  They weren\'92t too keen on taking me 
because I wanted to do things and they were already old, don\'92t forget.  My mother was 42 when I 
was born.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did the family do for relaxation during the year?\par
}{\plain FF: Huh, huh.  That\'92s a good question.  We relaxed at home.  We were glad to be home after a 
day\'92s work.\par
}{\plain SF: Did you listen to music or read or...?\par
}{\plain FF: Read.  My father was a great reader.  A great reader. We had a lot of books.  Always had a 
lot.  My mother always..I got her from the school library a book.  It was called Genevieve and she 
read that every year.  We had all the papers and magazines.  (SF: You had a Bechstein?.)  I took 
piano lessons but I wasn\'92t good at it.  I didn\'92t care. (SF: Did you have a record player?) FF: No, 
we didn\'92t have a record player.  (SF: Did you go to concerts?)  FF: Not in town.  When I came to 
Munich.  Yah, we had sometimes some theater groups coming to town.  Steven, don\'92t forget, it 
was a small town.  There weren\'92t such things as you ask.  You had to go to work early in the 
morning.  Those kinds of things, they are not real what you ask.  This is not this time.  
Remember when we used to go to Toms River, when they had the chicken farm?  They worked 
from mornings to night and went to bed at night.  Right.  This is the way it was at home too.  \par
}{\plain SF: What were your favorite subjects in school?\par
}{\plain FF: Math.  Reading.  No, I didn\'92t like history.  I hated history.  Geography.  I loved geography 
and I was very good at it.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did my father ever talk about school?\par
}{\plain FF: He was the best in math.  He enjoyed math.  He loved math.  And reading.  He used to say he 
wasn\'92t good in writing, in writing letters, but his handwriting was 100 times better than mine 
ever, and when he sat down and wrote a letter he came right down to the point, he didn\'92t flower it 
up but he knew how to write a letter.  Just like Uncle Leo.  He always said he wasn\'92t good in 
writing.  He wrote very well too.  \par
}{\plain SF: You went away at what age to go to school?  FF: 12.\par
}{\plain SF: Why did the send you away to school.  \par
}{\plain FF: Because that was the only way, you go away.  Because that was the break of the public 
school. 12.  SF: Did most people continue their education.\par
}{\plain FF: No.  They all went.  They went to 16.  It didn\'92t stop at 12 but that was the public...  I don\'92t 
know how to explain it to you.  The teacher always said that, to tell you the truth I to say, I was 
too smart for the school there and they should put me in a better school.  He didn\'92t know what to 
do with me a times to ask questions, you know.  Then my mother said she didn\'92t know what to 
do and then my relatives came from N\'fcrnberg, they came during the war.  They had no food so 
we gave them all the food, we had the chickens and we had the meat and we gave them....  Then 
they wanted to make good and they said \'93Why don\'92t you send her to us and we send her to 
school from hereon where she can learn better than at home.\'94  So that\'92s where I went.  Then I 
went to public school till 16, right?  How long do you go to public school?  14?  16?  Then I 
went right away from there to high school which we didn\'92t have home.  We had good teaching 
but not that excellent.  \par
}{\plain SF: So you went to high school in N\'fcrnberg?  FF: Yah.  See we didn\'92t just have one class 
together.  We had classes together third and fourth and fifth grade.  We had it in the morning.  
They had it in the afternoon.  It was just one schoolhouse.   In Wittelshofen.  N\'fcrnberg, that was 
much different.  It was such an old building.  Oh, was it old.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was it unusual to send the girl away to school?  FF: Yah, very unusual.  \par
}{\plain SF: You said Ida went away also.  FF: Well she had to go away to the orphanage.  \par
}{\plain SF:  But her mother was alive.  FF: Yah.  I don\'92t want to tape that....\par
}{\plain SF: Did you have any very good friends in school?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, I had very good friends in school.  In N\'fcrnberg they were very Nazis then already.  
They used to sing some Jewish things against the Jews then already.  At home yeah.  They were 
good.  I was very good with them.  (SF: Who were your best friends?) Selma in England who 
died and Ida naturally and there were a lot of...we were just like one family, there were a lot of 
girls I was very friendly with.  We didn\'92t even know any different.  I mean I didn\'92t go to their 
house and they didn\'92t come to my house but we were very family.  There was this girl, her name 
was Marga, who was at the post office who we supported.  Her mother had TB and she came 
home with me every day to eat.  When I expected my papers she says to me \'93We don\'92t give 
papers to Jews and I\'92m not giving it to you.\'94  She wouldn\'92t give me my paper and I went in and I 
threw her against the wall.  \par
}{\plain SF: Were your friends mostly Jewish?\par
}{\plain FF: No, there was just Ida and Selma and me and Josef, he went away to become a teacher and 
that was all of us young people.  SF: Who was Josef?  FF: Gallinger, the one who took me down 
like this and I thought I was pregnant.  I told you.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you ever have any private tutors?  FF: No, I never needed any.  I tutored others.  I helped 
Ida.  Don\'92t ever talk to Ida about school otherwise she\'92s going to hit the ceiling.  \par
}{\plain SF: Any special books you remember other than Genevieve?\par
}{\plain FF: Genevieve.  What I read.  I read everything.  Whatever came across I read.  I don\'92t know any 
special books but I read any romance and anything.  Whatever a kid reads.  We had a very good 
school library.\par
}{\plain SF: And you had good teachers too?\par
}{\plain FF: One.  He killed himself later on because he went after girls.  He went after me too.  He kept 
me in school and then he sat down with me.  Because I didn\'92t empty that spit thing he kept me in 
school.  Then he sat on the bench with me and we went all over me and I went home and told my 
father and then another girl the same thing.  Then they called him and told him and he didn\'92t and 
just wanted to be good to us and then, years later, I was already in ...oh ya I was in M\'fcnchen and 
he did the same thing and then they threw him out and he went to another town and did the same 
thing and then he killed himself.  But he was a very good teacher.\par
}{\plain SF: How about in N\'fcrnberg, what did you study?\par
}{\plain FF: Everything.  But nothing specific.  (SF: What about the professor who did this?\'96pointing to 
the pencil drawing/Mizrach).  Oh, he was wonderful.  He was wonderful.  In Hebrew.  Zeigler.  
He was a wonderful man.  I tell you something Steven, you ask me something 50 years ago and if 
you want me to remember those things I have to make up a story.  I cannot remember.  If you 
asked me what he looked like I really don\'92t know anymore.  I really don\'92t.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did your parents do during the inflation?\par
}{\plain FF: I was 14 years, 13, 14 years old.  I don\'92t know.  My father built a new stable.  He built a 
beautiful stable.  A modern stable where you fed the cows...you know you used to have to go in 
between the cows to put the food in and then it went around.  Just the heads faced you.  \par
}{\plain SF: Then you bought a piano too?  FF: Yah, we bought a piano.  I must have said that.  I forgot in 
the meantime.  As I tell you Steven...\par
}{\plain SF: Tell the story about the lady whose chickens you got drunk.  \par
}{\plain FF: Oh, well.  The lady I got the chickens drunk.  The lady didn\'92t like me and she lived 
downstairs in a house and every time I passed by with my bicycle I rang the bell like crazy 
because I didn\'92t want to run anybody over, you know, so she didn\'92t like me for that because 
sometimes she must have slept.  I woke her up with ringing the bell.  Everybody knew I was 
coming because I rung like a lunatic.  So whenever something was wrong in her place she 
blamed it on me even if I wasn\'92t there.  She\'92s says \'93Flora did it.  Flora did it.\'94  Once I came to 
Hebrew school and he said to me \'93What did you do to Frau Pollock? \'93 I said \'93nothing.\'94  He said 
\'93Yes you did\'94 and he hit me.  I said \'93What for?\'94 He said the Frau Pollock said you did 
something.  I didn\'92t say good morning or...she asked me...oh no, I never forget Frau Pollock, it 
was thundering and she says to me \'93Do you know the brocha over the thunder or the lightening?\'94 
I says \'93Yeah, but I forgot\'94 and I should have remembered it.  Frau Pollock said to the teacher 
\'93You don\'92t teach your children right.  She didn\'92t even know the brocha over thing\'94 so he hit me.  
Everything what was wrong she blamed it on me.  So one day I felt very hurt because she said I 
did something and as bad as a devil as I was, I never lied.  I told the truth even if I know I get 
punished.  \par
}{\plain So she made this up.  I don\'92t know what she told my father I did something I didn\'92t do so I said 
to myself \'93This time I\'92m going to hit you where it hurts you most.\'94  I just about had it.  She was 
this size but she was a devil.  So I had this apron on.  And she loved her chickens.  She always 
stood there and cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck and they stood in the middle and the clucks were all 
around her.  I put this challah, this Berches, in whiskey and as a child, as dumb as you are, and I 
put the whiskey things in my pocket and my pocket got all sticky and full of crumbs and I went to 
the chickens and I just through it.  I go cluck, cluck, cluck and all the cluck, cluck, clucks came 
and all the cluck, cluck, clucks they ate the thing and I stood there on the corner.  I know the spot.  
I looked and they ate like crazy and I threw more.  I went home and I was the happiest person.  I 
said to myself \'93This time I got you.  This time I got you.\'94  It didn\'92t take an hour.  She comes 
running in and she had such small feet.  \'93Herr Winter, Herr Winter.\'94  My father was for 
everybody.  My mother used to call him the blitzachleiter.  He was like whenever the lightening 
hit they knew where my father was.  We had a veterinarian.  We had him under thing (retainer).  
You never know what happens to the cows.  So she said \'93You got to call the veterinarian.  You 
got to call.  Oh my chickens are dying.  My chickens are sick.  My chickens are dying.  My 
children.  My children.\'94  My father said \'93What happened?\'94  She says \'93I don\'92t know what 
happened.  They were all right in the morning and I let them out and I come out and they are all 
laying there dead.\'94  So my father said she should go home and he is going to call the veterinarian 
and he is going to come out and he is going to tell her what to do.  He says \'93We get you chickens.  
Don\'92t worry about it.\'94  \'93No\'94 she says \'93We had those gray pearl chickens.\'94  They were all gray.  
They looked like pearls, you know.  My father said \'93We help you getting it.  Don\'92t worry about 
it.\'94  So she run home and she had a kerchief around.  My father said \'93What could happen?  What 
could happen?\'94  I stood on the door and I said to my father \'93Papa, her chickens aren\'92t sick.\'94  He 
said \'93What do you mean?\'94  I said \'93They\'92re not sick.  The chickens are drunk!\'94  So my mother 
said \'93Her chickens are drunk?  What are you saying? \'94 I said \'93You\'92re going to hit me.\'94  
(Background has Scott laughing.) I always said that.  My father said \'93Tell the truth.  I don\'92t hit 
you.\'94  My father never hit me anyway.  My mother did the hitting. I said \'93I tell you why.  
Because she is always saying things about me and she\'92s always lying about me and even the 
lehrer, the teacher, hit me because she lied about me.  I\'92m sick and tired and I wanted to hurt her.  
So I made her chickens drunk\'94 My father started laughing (continued laughing in background by 
Scott) and my mother said \'93Solomon that\'92s nothing to laugh.  This is the undergang.  She said 
this is the trouble with that kid.  Whatever she does you laugh to it.\'94  He said \'93What did you 
do?\'94 and I told him what I did.  My mother said \'93Where did you get the whiskey?\'94  I said 
\'93Home, from here.\'94  \'93How did you do it.\'94  \'93In my pocket.  My pocket was all fat and greasy 
from the liquor.\'94  I said \'93You gonna hit me.\'94  My father said \'93No, I don\'92t hit you but what am I 
going to tell her?  Because if I tell her this, you really be mud (Note:  Scott is continuing to laugh. 
and FF is feeding on his laughter.)\'94 My father went out.  To tell you the truth I don\'92t know what 
he told her but when he came out the chickens came back to life.  I don\'92t think he ever told her 
what happened but he came home and he took me on his lap and he says \'93Would you promise me 
one thing?  Would you promise me not to do those things.  This time you got away good.  The 
next time it\'92s not going to work that easy.  Don\'92t do those bad things.\'94  I said \'93She condemned 
me all the time.  She blames me for everything.\'94  Ida could do anything she wanted.  She never 
was wrong and I was always wrong and I got tired of it.  My father told her, he said to her 
\'93Enough is enough.  This constant bothering and the constant hurting the kid and the constant 
telling her the things, I don\'92t want you to do it.  If she does something wrong then we punish her, 
but you don\'92t leave her alone...\'94\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain I tell you what happened then.  She died a few years later.  We were supposed to sit there and 
watch over night.  See when the people died in small towns, you didn\'92t have a funeral parlor or 
anything.  You put straw on the floor and that\'92s where the person stood overnight.  The next day 
they got buried.  Ida, Selma and me were supposed to watch a few hours at night, you know, you 
changed off.  So I said to them \'93I don\'92t believe she\'92s dead\'94 so Ida said \'93Yes she\'92s dead.\'94  I said 
\'93Let me do something.\'94  I took the ball and I always played ball and I was very good like a ...?...I 
said \'93I\'92m going to throw the ball against the wall and if she doesn\'92t say anything then I will know 
she is dead.\'94  I took the ball, I threw it against the wall, she didn\'92t say anything, I said \'93She\'92s 
dead.  We have to sit.  We have to watch.  She\'92s dead.\'94  Then I believed.  We really had good 
times though.\par
}{\plain SF: Anything else you can remember like that?\par
}{\plain FF: No.  Then came the hard times.  }}
