...bit of a repetition about what's here, and where and when you were born and a little bit about your family. And I think you'll need to move a little closer.
\par AM:\tab O.K. I was born in Brussels, Belgium in 1933 and I lived there with my mother and father until 1940 when the war exploded and we ran away to France. My problem at the time
 was that I was in a hospital and in many ways I was responsible for saving my family's life because they thought that I should be in a sanitarium no matter what was happening. So, my father picked me up and we went off to France to find a place for me an
d
 the rest of the family stayed there and, of course, none of them survived. I lost my grandfather, all my uncles and aunts. One uncle survived, but he had married a Catholic and my grandfather disowned him so, to this day, he's still alive. We have diffic
u
lty in relating to him. An aunt survived. There were nine children in my father's family and of those everyone but two were killed. My mother's side were all from Warsaw, and she never heard from her parents again. But her sisters lived in Paris, and ther
e
 were five sisters. Two of them went to concentration camps. One wound up in Russia and then came to America afterwards. She just died recently. And my Tante Burnka from Paris, she hid for four years behind a wall in Paris at my aunt's place where my uncl
e
 was the shoemaker. And he had been captured during the war as a prisoner of war. And they didn't know he was Jewish so he survived the camps over there as a prisoner of war. My cousin from Paris, when we got over there, joined the French underground and 
h
e was all of 16. He was six years older than I. And there he was quite an apparition when he showed up one day and he was a wild man. And he had joined the most militant of all the underground groups, which was a left-wing Jewish outfit. And he was into r
eally getting the Germans to the point that even my father was scared of harboring him in our house. You know we were in the middle of France. I'm getting ahead of the story.
\par JB:\tab You were in a hospital? You were sick?
\par AM:\tab I was in the sanitarium in Belgium.
 I was seven years old. And I had a spot on my  lungs, which nobody ever figured out how it got there. The myth is that I got a sun stroke and got burned or something happened, which other doctors claim was part of TB. And I was in the hospital for about 
a
 year when I was six to seven. Then the war started on May 10th, 1940 and I was still in a hospital in St. Charles when my father took me with my little sister and my mother. And we smuggled across the French border because we--evacuees were not allowed t
o go through to France. The French would try to stop the flow of people at the time.
\par JB:\tab So you had a sister.
\par AM:\tab My little sister was one year old. She was born in 1939. So the most momentous moment at that time was that when we were being smuggled across 
with her she would be crying. But, you know, we could be discovered up there. Luckily my mother was nursing her so that solved the problem. When we got to France the French army got a hold of my father and drafted him right then and there to go in the arm
y
. And he knew that the war was lost and if he got caught he probably would be a prisoner of war. So he had told my mother--he didn't speak hardly in French, I was the translator at seven actually, from Yiddish to French--so before we got to Paris my fathe
r
 said, "Well, you know, your name is Armand now. And you're not called, Avrum no more. And you're not to speak Yiddish anymore except when your mother speaks to you, and you translate in to French. And if anybody asks you, you tell them it's Flemish." Whi
c
h, when we went to France most people didn't know what it was, in the part where we were. And he left us and he told us to go south and he would find us. And he gave us a train schedule and all that. The train was strafed and we were stopped right in the 
m
iddle of France where the tracks had been blown up. And we were just let go in the middle of a town and somebody let us have a stall from the stable. My mother and my little sister and I were in there and I progressively got sicker, a fever and of course 
i
t wasn't very clean so I had lots of diseases from the bugs and all that kind of thing. But my father, which was I would say three months after that, had deserted the army and had managed to find us. And it was the most incredible kind of thing because he
 
was able to trace us. We had left messages with a Belgian family and there weren't that many going in that direction. And he found us. And when he saw me he did something very dramatic and very adventurous. He just stopped the first truck he saw on the st
r
eet, which happened to be a gasoline truck. And he had a rifle with him and he had the uniform of a French soldier and well he said to the man that, you know, he had to take his son to the hospital. And, after much protest, but not too much choice for the
 
driver, he took us to a place which was a sanitarium, in the mountains of the Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand. And in that sense, I think that I was responsible for saving my family because they wanted to be close to me and they found a town, Volvic, which was
 
about four miles away, to be close to me. And I was put in this sanitarium for adults, in the woman's ward, which was a most unusual experience since I was the only little boy in a room full of, you know, women who were dying of TB. And I was there for ab
o
ut six months and they took very good care of me. Then I was transferred to a prevantorium. And this was 1941 when it was about the worst time. My father in the meantime, he was amazingly adaptable, to become everything, an electrician, a milkman, a chees
e
 maker, and finally he fell into a job that was as a surgical orthopedist. He didn't know anything about it. He was a leather maker, I mean he was a glove maker originally. And there he made contacts with somebody who was in the underground, Captain Durai
n
, that he still knows today. In the meanwhile I was getting to be nine years old and had skipped about three years of school by now and I was still in hospitals with this very fragile constitution. So my father was always looking for extra food and bread.
 
And the only thing that at the time was possible was wine, which was supposedly a medicine. So he would bring me a bottle of wine every week that the doctor recommended, which I suspect might have been my undoing for the future, but I think that when I fi
n
ally got better and my little sister Eliane was already four, my other sister Yvette was born. And I joined them in this little town where we were completely hidden and that my mother was passed off as Dutch. I was put into a regular school. And my father
 
didn't fight the church priest of the town from, you know, having me go to catechism and to Catholic school even though I knew that it was all a subterfuge. And I found that I could get along very well just assimilating and becoming invisible. To this day
 
I don't speak Yiddish, but I understand it perfectly. But I think the affects of that are so long-lasting. We found that we had no contact with family. There was no way of finding out what had happened. And the contacts that I had were very tenuous becaus
e
 the Gestapo, after France was declared an open country all the way through, they started to come into our town and looking for the underground. So I was witness to a few raids and atrocities when I was nine, ten. And those are the stories I tell my stude
nts as I teach now.}{\b\fs24 
\par }{\fs24 JB:\tab So you really grew up in those years from seven...
\par AM:\tab To fourteen.
\par JB:\tab To fourteen...
\par AM:\tab Before I came here.
\par JB:\tab In a subterfuge.
\par AM:\tab Absolutely.
\par JB:\tab Like a Marrano, really.
\par AM:\tab That's right. And I knew that I was Jewish, and I enj
oyed the games of fooling the priest. But I was doing it with Catholic boys who had no idea what I was about, so that I could never have an open friendship with anyone. And in that sense I always felt that I was very different. There was no antisemitism b
ecause there were no Jews. But when there was any mention in the church, it was always mostly economics so I knew that...
\par JB:\tab What about the, your own little nuclear family? Did they, were they able at that time to maintain any semblance of Jewish life internally or were they afraid also to do that?
\par AM:\tab No, my father was marvelous in trying to keep up, at least the rudiments, of the traditional holidays. And one time even I remember 1942, '43, he had found out through a network that there were a few Jews who
 lived in the countryside and that were gonna have a }{\i\fs24 seder}{\fs24 
. So we walked there seven miles, just myself and my father because my mother was going to stay with my two sisters. And we went there and there was a farmhouse. It was all hidden. And it looked lik
e a biblical scene. The men were at the window making sure that nobody was coming. And we had one }{\i\fs24 matzo}{\fs24 
 that somebody had made. It was a most moving and memorable kind of experience. We weren't very religious but that, everybody cried, of course.
\par JB:\tab How many people were there at that }{\i\fs24 seder}{\fs24 ?
\par AM:\tab There were about, well, I think 15 men with children, men, I mean boys over ten. So they had a }{\i\fs24 minyan}{\fs24  and a few more. And there were no }{\i\fs24 Haggadahs}{\fs24  but people remembered enough. And we never saw anybody else who 
went to a }{\i\fs24 seder}{\fs24 , you know, meeting in any kind of way except casually on the street. But...
\par JB:\tab What was the name of the town that you lived?
\par AM:\tab We lived in Volvic, which is near Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne.
\par JB:\tab Volvic?
\par AM:\tab Volvic. And Clermont-Ferra
nd was, well that's where they make Michelin tires now. It was a place that was very important for the Resistance as well as being a place that the English would bomb to get rid of the Michelin tires. There weren't too many Jews in that area because most 
of them had been picked up and sent to Drancy. And we knew about that so we were [unclear] there.
\par JB:\tab Do you remember anything of your life until you were seven, in Belgium? How much of it do you remember?
\par AM:\tab Quite a bit because I was, I would say from fiv
e on, constantly exposed to my larger family for the holidays, for any kind of family gatherings. And the pictures that we had, hundreds and hundreds of pictures, always stimulated, you know, remembrances of the time. So I found that I remember quite a bi
t
, in the sense that our family was left of center? Very left of center. My grandfather was, I don't know, he kept talking about Russia and thinking that, you know, they would come to their senses. And nobody believed him but still, he was a marvelous, mar
v
elous man my grandfather. A long beard--I think I grew one because of him--and great hands. He was a skillful engraver. And he would pop up in the middle of the night at my house and just pick me up. And I remember that; I was five, six. Much ado was made
 
by my parents. But still, he was a presence that was so overwhelming. Oh, my father too, who deferred to him on all matters, really. I don't recall ever going to synagogue before I was seven. But I do know one thing that as the war ended and I was just ab
out 13, there was for sure going to be a }{\i\fs24 bar mitzvah}{\fs24 . And even though there was no time for me to learn Hebrew, the whole ceremony was transliterated into French and I did study for six weeks intensely, since I was going to be the first 
}{\i\fs24 bar mitzvah}{\fs24  in Brussels after the war. So that was very significant.
\par JB:\tab You went back to Brussels then?
\par AM:\tab We went back to Brussels after the war. My father was, had been involved with fighting at the end because he had come out as being part of the Resistance. And then we 
went to Paris just as, it had been liberated by the French, by the French Army or the American Army really. And there was nobody there. And my father was trying to find any survivor. And he found that my cousins, three children from a sister, had survived
 
and had been put into a Catholic home and he wanted to get them out of there. The Jewish organization was able to reach them too, and they were interested in getting them to Palestine. And my father came and you know, said that they had the choice of goin
g
 to America, since our cousins in Philadelphia had offered us passage. So they decided to come along and then they came over here two years afterwards. But we went back to Belgium before the end of the war and we were bombed by the V-1s and V-2s that neve
r
 got to England because at that time, during the Battle of the Bulge, we were in Brussels. And this was the end of, the winter of '44. And the war didn't end till the spring of '45. So that we were exposed to that kind of thing where there was nothing you
 could do, because if you were in a building and you could hear this bomb flying over and if it stopped, was silent, either it went straight down or the house would be blown up, whatever.
\par JB:\tab When you went back to Belgium, was there anyone there from your family?
\par AM:\tab One sister, Tante Raymonde, who somehow had managed to, I don't know how she did it, but she survived and she found us an apartment. And she's still alive today, very sick, and she has a disintegrating spine. She is getting a little...
\par JB:\tab Where is she?
\par AM:\tab She's in Belgium now and my father's there with her. She was just put into a home for incurables. She's 68. She was the youngest of the family. And...
\par JB:\tab The parents? Your grandparents?
\par AM:\tab Everybody was gone. They were taken in '42 and we got the lists back of their deaths confirmed from Buchenwald and their names are on a monument now in Belgium. So that's my grandparents, and my aunts, and my uncles, all cousins.
\par JB:\tab When you were in school in the little town in France, hiding the fact that you were Jewish, what kind of association was there in terms of the townspeople knowing what was going on? Did they have any indication what was happening with the Nazis?

\par AM:\tab Oh yes. They had an indication of what was happening because the Nazis always ca
me in to try to get their goods. They were farmers. They wanted all their food and all that. And they were fairly patriotic. There weren't too many collaborators in that town because there was a strong bed of resistance. But as far as consciously being aw
a
re that I was different and that I might be in danger from the people in the town? No, I didn't feel that. As a matter of fact there was a raid from the Gestapo and all the important people in town were taken away of which the priest, the doctor, the head
 of the school. And this was a little town of maybe 500 people. So, they took all the leadership and sent them to concentration camp. And in that sense it made them certainly much more resistant to the Nazis.
\par JB:\tab Did you know that Jews were the focus of...
\par AM:\tab Oh certainly.
\par JB:\tab You knew it. Your family knew it.
\par AM:\tab Oh yes, sure, sure. We had heard stories from before the war, because my father was politically active, and he knew about concentration camps. And he was begging his father to run away because he 
believed the stories that were happening in Nazi Germany. My grandfather didn't believe them and he said that, you know, God would take care of him. Well, he certainly did.
\par JB:\tab So you knew, living in a Catholic environment and passing yourselves off...
\par AM:\tab Absolutely.
\par JB:\tab ...as Catholics.
\par AM:\tab No, no, not Catholics.
\par JB:\tab Not Catholics.
\par AM:\tab We said we were Christian, vaguely, non-den-, you know, not Catholics because then we would have had to go to Church officially as their members. But my father 
always played a whatever was the dominant, he would be the minority as long as it was still kosher. But in that sense I had to go to the Catholic school for Catholicism because all my friends in school were, and the priest would have raised an eyebrow and
 all that sort of thing. And I developed a real strong curiosity for history during that time. And that made me fairly objective too.
\par JB:\tab When you were in Belgium until you were seven, eight, that age, did you live in a Jewish community?
\par AM:\tab For a while, an
d then, which was completely Jewish and on the left. But then my father found a job as a glove maker in an ar-, working for, of course, for a Jewish concern. But there were no Jews around me, so that that made us feel like we were also strangers in a neig
hborhood. I guess it started us to guard ourselves at that time because I remember, at that time, being taught it was O.K. for antisemitic remarks in school, especially when St. Nicholas would come around and I didn't celebrate.
\par JB:\tab As a young child in Belgium?
\par AM:\tab As a very, first grade, you know. I was six or seven.
\par JB:\tab Was there any interaction with the community as Jews, with the non-Jewish community?
\par AM:\tab No, no, there weren't, because at the time the fascist party, the Rex party, was so, so dominant and antisemitic--it would have been the equivalent of the Klan--that Jews kept a very, very low profile.
\par JB:\tab So that your experience, until you returned to Belgium, was pretty negative.
\par AM:\tab Absolutely.
\par JB:\tab Antisemitic remarks while you were...
\par AM:\tab Very young.
\par JB:\tab Very young, and then hiding the fact that you were Jewish, for survival.
\par AM:\tab That's right.
\par JB:\tab What prompted the decision at the end of the war to come to America?
\par AM:\tab Well, there was a GI that showed up in Paris when we were there. It happened to be 
a cousin in Philadelphia who was looking for us. He knew that there was a brother who had children. And this was Hymie Nathanson from Strawberry Mansion. And he was an MP. And he came over, he brought presents and boxes and things. He said, "You have rela
t
ives. You know, you're not alone. Come to Philadelphia. We'll help you. You're a glove maker. We'll start you in business, whatever." My father at the time was debating whether really he shouldn't go with whatever friends were left in Belgium to Palestine
,
 you know. And at the time the decision was that, "Well, if somebody's gonna give us a hand then it will be easier in America." And so in 1947 with all the papers--luckily we were Belgians therefore on the quota list, we were way up there on the list, we 
never had too much difficulty--we got a boat in G\'f6teborg, Sweden and landed in New York, which was a most amazing experience to see those buildings and all those lights and all that food! God!
\par JB:\tab Who came with you?
\par AM:\tab My mother, my two little sisters, and
 my father. And we were set up on Stanley Street in North Philadelphia, Strawberry Mansion. And my father promptly failed in business and then went to work for somebody else. And I learned English, since I didn't know any English. And I learned English at
 the Lawson School in South Philadelphia and then we to Fitzimmons for six months and then to Central.
\par JB:\tab Armand, you indicate that your family and you knew during those years of the war what was going on. Do you feel that you knew the extent of it, of the
 concentration camps and the extermination policy of the Nazis or did you learn more after the war was over?
\par AM:\tab I think that we had this unreasoning, nebulous fear that my father was able to inculcate in us because of his contacts, and telling us that the
 worst thing is what they did. And then it was confirmed when we saw actual Gestapo tactics in our villages and the stories of the tortures that they did in the Gestapo headquarters. So why wouldn't they do that to Jews if they took them to concentration 
c
amps? So that it wasn't proven until really the middle of the war, but by the end we were pretty certain, before they discovered the concentration camps. There was such a hatred of the Jews from the Belgians. They considered themselves blood brothers of t
h
e Germans, the Flemish part, that there was no doubt about their intentions if they had a chance. And lots of times countries like Belgium and France, the antisemitic element there was stronger than the Nazis in terms of turning in the Jews. So we always 
felt that if they could think it, they would do it.
\par JB:\tab So essentially those of your family who came to the United States after the war, who were saved, was your immediate family...
\par AM:\tab That's right.
\par JB:\tab ...and the two female cousins you spoke of earlier.
\par AM:\tab And one male cousin, Charlie Kimozhay. He was a doctor in Philadelphia. And that was it, out of a family of about 55.
\par JB:\tab You remember all of them, or most of them?
\par AM:\tab I remember most of them because we were very, very close in terms of 
meeting every week, at least twice a week. So that my little cousins, who were the same age, we grew up on, the only ones I could really let my guard down with. And we were intimates, just like brothers and sisters rather than cousins. So that I remember 
them very, very, very fondly and certainly nostalgically. Willy Boy, well Boy is a funny name. His name was really, he had another name but my grandfather called him Boy so everybody called him Boy. Boychik. Yeah.
\par JB:\tab You maintained your French name.
\par AM:\tab I maintained my French name, yes, because there was a turnaround when I was 14, I came to this country. I mean, I was }{\i\fs24 bar mitzvahed}{\fs24 
 as Abraham, but my birth certificate had been burned and my new one with identity and all that kind of thing was changed so th
at, at the time, it seemed that it was more convenient. Then my father decided to go back to Mednicki and by that time I was a teenager and I decided, no, I would drop the "I" and be Mednick. And then a whole business of identity became important in Ameri
ca and I decided to become French rather than Jewish because it was a great help in high school.
\par JB:\tab What, tell me about your }{\i\fs24 bar mitzvah}{\fs24 .
\par AM:\tab Well, there was one synagogue in the center of Belgium, in Brussels that was rededicated after the war. And there 
weren't too many young people who had lived in Belgium who the rabbi had known about so that when my father found out that, you know, it would be possible to have the }{\i\fs24 bar mitzvah}{\fs24 
 there, he made arrangements then we moved pretty close to it, actually. And we gathered all the family that we could for my }{\i\fs24 bar mitzvah}{\fs24 
. My uncle came back from a prisoner of war camp, from France, and my cousin, who was crippled because he had been in prison with the Germans and he had been put into some torturous thing. And he's 
still crippled but he's quite a brain. And the whole family was there. And it was standard in the sense that I got, all I remember at the end was really all these pens and watches. It was just like any other }{\i\fs24 bar mitzvah}{\fs24 
 except that it was all in French. And the first part of the }{\i\fs24 parshah}{\fs24  was }{\i\fs24 Vayakhel}{\fs24  that I remember to this day! But I never learned Hebrew really. And it was a symbolic day.
\par JB:\tab Do you remember when you first heard the name Hitler?
\par AM:\tab 
I'm sure I heard it all the time because there were political conversations all the time in my father's house. However, as far as being the genius of evil that, you know, he never struck me as being terribly different from the other names. I mean, they ta
l
ked about Leon Blum and Daladier and Chamberlain in the same breath as they did Hitler at the time. You know, there was no war. But afterwards Hitler just became this absolute giant, god-like, evil figure that has pursued my memory for ever since the war 
has been over.
\par JB:\tab You know, because you are younger than so many survivors, it's as if your total early life was involved with subterfugian escape.
\par AM:\tab Mmm hmm, yes, it's true. And I'm sure that it has shaped my whole life from that. I am very reticent to 
socialize really. I don't go into community action of any sort. I, you know, very much keep to myself. And I'm sure that that has made it's mark on me. Just general staying back and making sure I don't get hurt again.
\par JB:\tab Your father is still alive.
\par AM:\tab My
 father is still alive. And he is 73, very gregarious, and an absolutely marvelous man whose, I'm afraid, also high point of his life was the war. Except there he was in his full glory in that he survived by, you know, using subterfuge and marvelous feats
 of wit.
\par JB:\tab Your mother and sisters?
\par AM:\tab My mother died in 1963 from a disease called demphigus, which is a form of lupus. And my sisters are alive, both married, one in Jersey, one in Texas, Austin.
\par JB:\tab Because they are younger, do you think they have the same affect?
\par AM:\tab No. I spoke to them about this. They don't recall any of it. All they remember is right after the war, a little bit in Belgium, but nothing from the war itself experience. Except some of the things that are memorable such as getting a pre
sent from the Red Cross in the middle of the war and my sister biting through the orange not knowing about the peel, or a banana that she had never seen--that kind of thing. But nothing that they experienced themselves.
\par JB:\tab Do you, in your relationship with those cousins who have survived and are here, do you have a particular relationship with them that you think was formed because of these experiences?
\par AM:\tab Absolutely, especially the older sister, the eldest, who is now becoming a doctor. She's 53 and she's been at it 20 years. It's amazing.
\par JB:\tab Really.
\par AM:\tab She is the one who has the best memory of it, because she was the oldest. And as a matter of fact about three months ago she came here and we spent a whole afternoon talking about things that she doesn't
 talk with her sister and brother that much: the day she saw her parents taken away by the Gestapo, the day that she knew that, you know, there's a good chance that they might not survive unless they actually became Catholic in the convent, her sister, an
d
 not knowing where her brother was, and the terrible kind of turmoil in knowing that there was nobody to rely on. And it's coming up now more frankly. The pain is still there but at least we can talk about it. But my relationship with my cousin is based m
ostly on the fact that we came ov-

\par AM:\tab Is it on now?
\par JB:\tab Yes.
\par AM:\tab My relationship with my cousin, Charlie, is based much more on the fact that 
we're both from Europe, speaking French, and survivors and being really like brothers in America for four years of intimate living--we lived in the same room, actually--and exchanging our reaction to, you know, the new country as well as the old, and not 
so much based on the war experiences as well. Very totally different. And we did discuss it, but never in depth when we were young. It was just too close. It takes about 30 years.
\par JB:\tab Because I'm in a unique situation of knowing about your work, would you talk a little bit about the plaques that you've completed and why you undertook them, and what it's meant to you to have done that series?
\par AM:\tab Well, just about the time that my mother died in '63 things began to happen to my work in terms of...
\par JB:\tab Your work as a potter.
\par AM:\tab As a potter, on the wheel and things. And figures were appearing that I had no idea where from. Eventually, by 1970, I knew that I had to exorcize this whole experience in some tangible way because I couldn't really talk about it to my f
ather because we just, I mean we were just a mutual kind of crying society. But I worked it out so that from 1970 to 1982 I started to make the reliefs of a symbolic, mythical kind of personal view of the Holocaust. And I think that it took that long beca
u
se if I had done it faster it would not have been as deep and as satisfying to my own peace of mind. I don't feel, or believe that it's over now but it certainly feels that I have set aside some of those nightmares that had no names because at that age yo
u
 just cannot respond rationally. The things were certainly not exact or they are not representational. But they certainly represent a kind of journey through my mind about what I imagine my family, who went to these concentration camps, had to endure. I a
l
so felt that it was important for anyone that had any way of expressing it, aside from speaking, had a responsibility to pass on something tangible because we would go soon and I always believed that clay would last forever. And this was one way of doing 
it.
\par JB:\tab Have you exorcized?
\par AM:\tab No, but it's helped a lot.
\par JB:\tab The interesting thing about the plaques is that they are experiences in your psyche. They are not experiences that you witnessed, because many of them are concentration camp scenes.
\par AM:\tab That's r
ight. That's right. It's artistic freedom to express one's deeper feelings about a horror that cannot be expressed in words really. And I found that the clay and the absolute irony of having to use an oven to fire them, just struck me as being something t
hat had to be done.
\par JB:\tab And maybe a way of putting those people to rest for yourself.
\par AM:\tab For myself, yes, except that it's important in terms of my own peace of mind that remembrances be constant. Not every day but certainly on a regular basis. And if thos
e things are around there's no way that the people that I care about would forget. Certainly I won't.
\par JB:\tab O.K.
