\par MF:\tab Concert pianist.
\par EM:\tab Concert pianist. Professor Filar, could you tell me what your life was like in Warsaw before the war?
\par MF:\tab Well, it was fine. I went to school, to the }{\i\f0 Gymnasium}{\f0  and graduated }{\i\f0 Gymn}{\i\f0 a}{\i\f0 sium}{\f0 . I also went to The Warsaw Conservatory. I played my first concert at The Warsaw Conservatory when I was si
x years old. I played with the Philharmonic. I was a soloist when I was twelve, two concerts. The conductors were, first was Professor}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Walerian [u}{\f0 n}{\f0 clear] and then Kazimierz}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
Wielkomierski, two very famous names. Then, oh, well I played later in \lquote 59. I played in Warsaw, and I played [unclear].
\par EM:\tab Well, excuse me. We will come to that later. Could you tell me if it was a r}{\f0 e}{\f0 ligious family? Did you...
\par MF:\tab Oh yes. My father was a religious Jew. I had my }{\i\f0 bar mitzvah}{\f0  when I was 13 and I spoke some Hebrew. And my grandfather was a rabbi.
\par EM:\tab All right, now, did your mother come from an Orthodox family also?
\par MF:\tab Yes, yes,  her father, her father was a rabbi.
\par EM:\tab Her father was a rabbi. Now...

\par MF:\tab No.
\par EM:\tab No, they did not.
\par MF:\tab No, we didn\rquote t feel any.
\par EM:\tab O.K. Now you mentioned your father was in business. What kind of business did he have?
\par MF:\tab Well, he had a wholesale business and }{\i\f0 Manufaktura}{\f0 , well, I don\rquote t know, a man\rquote s, not ready made clothes, just materials.
\par EM:\tab Materials?
\par MF:\tab Yeah. Yeah, it was a big place.
\par EM:\tab O.K. Do you remember the name of the street where you lived?
\par MF:\tab Yes. I know}{\b\f0  }{\f0 the}{\b\f0  }{\f0 name. Sienna}{\b\f0  }{\f0 72.

\par MF:\tab Gesia}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Osiem. Gesia 8.
\par EM:\tab Oh, Gesia, on Gesia Street. Now...
\par MF:\tab It does not exist anymore. It\rquote s called Anielewicza today. It\rquote s a different street. The whole town}{\b\f0  }{\f0 is}{\b\f0  }{\f0 different.
\par EM:\tab Did you or your family belong to any Zionist organizations?
\par MF:\tab Oh yeah, my father was a Zionist.
\par EM:\tab Did you belong to any Zionist...

\par MF:\tab No, nobody was in the army. I don\rquote t know why, because my...the other gran}{\f0 d}{\f0 father, my father\rquote s father\emdash this my mother\rquote s father\emdash my father\rquote s father when he died he said, \ldblquote 
None of my grandchildren will serve in the army.\rdblquote  And nobody did, my cousins, nobody. I don\rquote t know, it was sort of, that was not }{\i\f0 liczbowy}{\f0  [inducted] if you know what that means.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab Or, just they weren\rquote t taken.
\par EM:\tab Right.
\par MF:\tab And they were all category A.
\par EM:\tab Did all your brothers and sisters finish high school? You mentioned that you finished high school.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, yeah, well, my sisters finished }{\i\f0 Gymnasium Landauowa}{\f0  on Czarna}{\i\f0  }{\f0 Street. And my one brother finished }{\i\f0 chinuch}{\f0 , one brother, Finkel. They all went to school. They all had at least }{\i\f0 Gymnasium}{\f0 .

\par EM:\tab So they had at least }{\i\f0 Gymnasium}{\f0 . Now, what happened to your family follow\-ing the German invasion? Were you in Warsaw when, during the invasion?
\par MF:\tab No. I, well, first I ran away. We ran away and we went to the Bug River, came to Bialystok.
\par EM:\tab Well, to the Bug River. I have to repeat it. Bug River.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, the Bug River was the border between the German occupation and the Russian occupation. But when we arrived there, the Russians weren\rquote t there yet. We didn\rquote 
t invite them. All of a sudden, they crossed the border on the 17th of September. The war started on the 1st. We left Warsaw by the 6th, the 7th.
\par EM:\tab Did the whole family leave Warsaw?
\par MF:\tab Well?
\par EM:\tab Who left Warsaw?
\par MF:\tab In 1935 my mother sent one brother, Yaacov, was sent out to Israel, Palestine at that time, because she saw Hitler coming here. So she said, \ldblquote One of my children has to go now because hell}{\b\f0  }{\f0 will all}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
of a sudden turn}{\b\f0  }{\f0 loose}{\b\f0  }{\f0 here and maybe we\rquote ll have a place where to go.\rdblquote  So he left in \lquote 
35. And he, well, he left without a certificate. It was a whole story. He went as a tourist to Syria. From there with a couple of colleagues, they went through a little forest. The English were shooting after th
em. He fell, and it was at night, so he broke a leg in a little forest. He got into a hole at night. He didn\rquote t see it. They put him in a hospital, in a jail hospital. And then the Zionist organization gave him a certif}{\f0 i}{\f0 cate and that
\rquote s how he finally made it to Palestine.
\par EM:\tab To Palestine. Now...
\par MF:\tab Now he was a great hero in the Second World War.
\par EM:\tab O.K. We\rquote re going to come to that a little later. Tell me, who left Warsaw when the Germans were fighting.
\par MF:\tab Well, [unclear], who left was my brother Michael and my sister Lucy with her husband, and I. Yeah.
\par EM:\tab So, were both your sisters, who was married of your siblings at that time?
\par MF:\tab Oh, who was? Gerald was married, and Isaac was married.
\par EM:\tab Did they have children?
\par MF:\tab Yes, Isaac had a little boy. They}{\b\f0  }{\f0 were}{\b\f0  }{\f0 murdered.
\par EM:\tab So you left Warsaw on September 17th?
\par MF:\tab No, about the...
\par EM:\tab No?
\par MF:\tab 6th or 7th.
\par EM:\tab Oh, 6th or the 7th. O.K., and you went to...
\par MF:\tab To Bialystok. From there...
\par EM:\tab To Bialystok. How long did you stay in Bialystok?
\par MF:\tab Well, just a couple of weeks or so, because then I played a concert there. A colleague came from Lemberg. he said that our Professor Drzewiecki is in Lemberg. So I went to Lemberg, and I became his assistant, and I graduated }{\i\f0 
summa cum laude}{\f0 .
\par EM:\tab You graduated }{\i\f0 summa cum laude}{\f0 ...
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab In Lemberg Conservatory.
\par MF:\tab Right.
\par EM:\tab And you stayed in Lemberg how long?
\par MF:\tab Well, from 1939 till December, 1941, when I went back to Warsaw. I had a chance to run away further deep into Russia, but I didn\rquote t want to.
\par EM:\tab Who was in Warsaw at that time that you went back to?
\par MF:\tab Well, my father, my mother, my oldest brother and his wife were at home, and my sister.
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab My sister and Isaac was there too. Isaac was with his wife and little boy. So my oldest brother Joe, Isaac with his wife and little boy, and my parents, and my sister Helen. Yaacov was already in Tel Aviv and...
\par EM:\tab O.K., now, could you tell me if you went directly, in 1941, there was a ghetto already. Did you...
\par MF:\tab Where?
\par EM:\tab In Warsaw. But I thought also...
\par MF:\tab In Warsaw, yeah, not in Lemberg yet.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, but, but you went back in 1941.
\par MF:\tab Right.
\par EM:\tab Did you go...
\par MF:\tab My parents sent a guide for me, who looked more Jewish than I do. And n}{\f0 o}{\f0 body bugged him, but somebody bugged me, but I made it.
\par EM:\tab You came back by train?
\par MF:\tab Yeah. I was all night train and I was, so I\rquote ll tell you this. I was sitting on a train. And there was a Polish railroad man who was off duty, and this slob, the railroad man which they used to have, and he looked at me. T
he way he looked at me, it didn\rquote t look good to me. So I went out in the hallway, smoked a cigarette. A minute later he was standing right next to me and his nose next to my nose. \ldblquote It looks like I got you, you Jew.\rdblquote 
 But I speak Polish better than he did. He didn\rquote t know that. So I opened my mouth and I started to talk fast. And in fifteen minute his wrinkles just smoothin\rquote 
 out, and a half he told me how he cheats on his wife. Yeah, but he told me that he smells a Jew a mile away. And I said, \ldblquote You smell them a mile away? I smell them even }{\i\f0 two}{\f0  miles away!\rdblquote 
 I was a worse antisemite than he was. When we arrived in Warsaw about 6:30 in the morning, we said good-bye to each other and he said to me\emdash well, I cannot speak Polish so I\rquote ll say it in English\emdash he said, \ldblquote You k
now, if I wouldn\rquote t have been talking to you all night, I would have been sure you\rquote re a Jew.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Slow down, Mister, you\rquote re insulting your friend so I might not like it.\rdblquote 
 And we shook hands and when he left I said, \ldblquote I hope he breaks a leg.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab You didn\rquote t say it too loud?
\par MF:\tab Nope.
\par EM:\tab No? All right. Now, were your parents in the ghetto at that time?
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab Which one, the big ghetto or the little ghetto?
\par MF:\tab Well, the little ghetto, on Sienna}{\b\f0  }{\f0 72.
\par EM:\tab They stayed on Sienna. You lived on Sienna and they stayed on Sienna.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, right, Sienna, right.

 he couldn\rquote t open the door because they had an iron bar on it, and it froze. That\rquote s how cold it was. So I hear how he says to my mother, \ldblquote Where\rquote s the hammer?\rdblquote  Mother said, \ldblquote In the bathroom.\rdblquote 
 So he went and got a hammer and knocked it off. And I\rquote m telling you, [unclear] it was a reunion. It was quite a reunion. And it was about twelve noon and my sister Helen is still in bed. I said, \ldblquote Why don\rquote

it and they got into the ghetto and stopped everybody that didn\rquote t look Jewish. So they stopped my sister. They said, \ldblquote You Polack, where\rquote s your husband? Is he an officer? What are you doing here?\rdblquote  She says, \ldblquote 
No, I\rquote m Jewish.\rdblquote  They slapped her, took her to Gestapo hea}{d}{

\par EM:\tab Right? O.K., how did your father make a living?
\par MF:\tab Well, who made a living? Whatever money he had left. Well, he sold his business as fast as he could. I remember, I walked into the bathroom and there were fish swimming around in the bathtub. Whatever somebody could ge

t so easy, you know? Not, it was because they, the first business the Nazis cleaned out was my father\rquote 
s business, by the way. Yeah. And so he was hiding the money which he was selling, he was hiding in a piece of cloth. And one day...the Germans were already there, and the doors were closed. And one of the 
employees had the keys with him and the Nazis caught him and said, \ldblquote Where is it?\rdblquote  So they}{\b\f0  }{\f0 had}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
him open up. They went in there, they chased everybody out and they took the keys. And the next day they came with trucks. And they were catching Jews to take the
 stuff out. Only one person knew where the money was. My father knew. So he put a raincoat on top of him, and got hi}{\f0 m}{\f0 
self in between the people who were carrying his materials out, took this piece under his raincoat and ran. He was 65 years old. And the Germans were shooting after him. He was running, zigzagging. He was a pretty sporty man. They didn\rquote 
t catch him. He ran away. Otherwise they would have nothing to eat the next day.

\par EM:\tab No, no, well, 1939.
\par MF:\tab Right.
\par EM:\tab O.K., now, how long did you stay in the ghetto? What happened next?
\par MF:\tab Well, I was in the ghetto till the uprising.
\par EM:\tab Now, on the...
\par MF:\tab No, first they closed up the small ghetto and we moved, we got, I got a job on, it\rquote s called }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0 
, out of Warsaw West, working, going outside and working there for the German railroad. And we had to get out of the ghetto. They liquidated it, the small ghetto, and so everybody moved to the big ghetto. And then that time, the German rai}{\f0 l}{\f0 
road requisitioned, I mean they took over a house, an empty house, on Mila 7. Mila is a famous street. Mila 18 was famous.
\par EM:\tab I know.
\par MF:\tab Because the big guys, the tough guys were there. I was in Mila 7, almost across the street from them. And that\rquote 
s where we were. All the people who worked for the railroad lived in that house. So my brother was with me. He also worked there, Joe my oldest brother, and I. And when we went t
here for the first, started to work there, they beat the hell out of us. They were...
\par EM:\tab Where was the }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0 ? Where did you [unclear]?
\par MF:\tab Warsaw West.
\par EM:\tab Oh, Warsaw West.
\par MF:\tab }{\i\f0 Warszawa Zachodnia}{\f0 .
\par EM:\tab [unclear].
\par MF:\tab We had to carry rails, and do all kinds of physical work. And they, I guess they wanted money from us. We didn\rquote t have anything anyway. And I remember there}{\b\f0  }{\f0 were}{\b\f0  }{\f0 open}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
heads, they were beating to kill, always just beating somebody. And all of a sudden, here comes my first help. Excuse me. A German, a Polish railroad man comes over, goes up to a German and he}{\b\f0  }{\f0 says, \ldblquote I need one man for work.
\rdblquote  And he points at me. He says, \ldblquote He\rquote ll be a good one. Can I take him?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Take him.\rdblquote  We walk away. He said, \ldblquote Don\rquote t worry about a thing. You\rquote re a colleague of my son,
\rdblquote  who was a singer, a colleague at the conservatory. His father was working for the railroad, and he had a little house in the middle of the }{\i\f0 tot}{\f0 
 [track] I mean in English, in other words, he was switching rails when a train went one way or the other.
\par EM:\tab Right.
\par MF:\tab He had a little house there. So we went over to that house and there was his son! And I spent the rest of the day. We had a drink. He sang and I played. He saved me because he told me his son went went by, he saw the Nazis are killi
ng us. And he reco}{\f0 g}{\f0 nized me. So, he sent his father out to save me. So, I went over there and then he took me back when the time, when, about six, seven o\rquote clock to go back. He said, \ldblquote This Jew works very good. I\rquote 
ll take him next day too.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote O.K. Come back.\rdblquote  Finally we found out what he wanted, and we gave him whatever we had\emdash peanuts\emdash 
and they stopped beating us. But I was saved because the, I think one was killed.
\par EM:\tab Were these S.S. men that were beating you?
\par MF:\tab Oh yeah, sure.
\par EM:\tab Or were they just }{\i\f0 Wehrmacht}{\f0 ?
\par MF:\tab Yes, S.S. men.
\par EM:\tab They were S.S. men.
\par MF:\tab Mmm hmm.
\par EM:\tab How many people would go out on your }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0 ?
\par MF:\tab How many we were?
\par EM:\tab People.
\par MF:\tab A group of about 100, 120 people.
\par EM:\tab And you were going out every day to the same place to work?
\par MF:\tab Yes, that\rquote 
s right. We went out through the gate. I remember, and so and we were taking things with us. You know, like you could wear on your five, six shirts. Or you could wear a sheet around you, or two sheets. And they were pulling it out, while we wal
k on the street. We bribed the railroad men who were escorting us, and the Polish fellows were running along on the sidewalk. They said, \ldblquote What do you have? We\rquote ll do business with you.\rdblquote 
 So we gave them the stuff in the morning. It looked funny. Well, you\rquote re pulling out something out of your, you know, giving them all the, taking shirts off on the street while you walk. They said, \ldblquote What do you want for you go back?
\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Well, I want butter, I want this, I want bread.\rdblquote  And I remember, and I was wearing a 
raincoat on top of my winter coat, because I got a pound of butter. O.K., so what it was, we made a hole in a raincoat pocket so the butter fell all the way down to the bottom. There was a lining so it won\rquote 
t fall out. Because the S.S. usually, when they checked us they put their arms around you here. They never went that low. But this time I was out of luck. This German went down, and he found it. And he said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Butter}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 
willst du fressen}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  [You want to eat butter?] And he hit me in the face so I had five fingers on my cheek for about a week. \ldblquote Put that in the guard house and get the hell out!\rdblquote  So that was already b}{\f0 e}{\f0 
hind the guards. There were five, six of them. So I put in the guard house. I put this packet down and took a bigger one and got home, it was two pounds of butter!
\par EM:\tab Where did you get the bigger one? It was there?
\par MF:\tab Right!
\par EM:\tab [unclear].
\par MF:\tab Well, everybody had one and when they\rquote re caught they had to put it in this little guard house.
\par EM:\tab Oh, and you...
\par MF:\tab And that was already, they were behind us already. So I put this down. I said, \ldblquote He told me to put it down.\rdblquote  I saw a bigger package. He didn\rquote 
t see it. I put it under, and walked out. When I got home [unclear] my mother laughed [unclear]...

\par MF:\tab The uprising was in April, Passover.
\par EM:\tab Could you tell me about resistance in the ghetto before the uprising? Was there any?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, let me tell you what happened. First of all
, we never believed that that nice nation like, of Germans, who created so much in literature and music and so on could be such horrible murderers, the worst in the history of mankind. So, we one day started, when they put out the first announcements that
 the Jewish population of Warsaw is gonna be resettled further east where they\rquote ll get work, and they\rquote ll have place where to live and all that. And who comes }{\i\f0 freiwillig,}{\f0 
 on his own free will, to the train will get a what is it, a, two pounds of...
\par EM:\tab A\'85
\par MF:\tab Two pounds of bread or a pound of bread, two pounds of marmalade, or the other way around. So a lot of people, beggars who were dying on the street, literally d}{\f0 y}{\f0 
ing from hunger. I once stepped on a dead body at night. I was going from my brother\rquote s, who wa
s on Sienna 30, to Sienna 72. There were no lights, nothing. It was dark already. It must have been ten in the evening. Then I walked, and all of a sudden I feel I\rquote m step-, I stepped on something soft. And I looked, I\rquote 
m standing on a belly of a dead man. It was just horrible. So they were going first. They didn\rquote t care what will happen next. But how did we found out that they\rquote 
re killing? The first time we found out, I found out, I had a girlfriend. Her name was Krysia}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Totenberg. Her cousin was a very famous 
violinist. She was a student of violin at the conservatory. When I went to, she lived not far from us, and I went to see her about something, and there was a cousin who came from Lublin. He was a tall, blonde, blue-eyed fellow, looked like a 100% Pole. He
 never looked like, not a trace of Jew in him. And he was sitting there, trembling, telling a...horrible story that they\rquote re killing people, that all the mass murder was started in Lublin, around there. So he said that they\rquote 
re killing people, they\rquote re gassing them. I said, \ldblquote Are you crazy or some\-thing? What is this?\rdblquote  He said he just ran away, he came here to warn. So the word started to spread around. But the way we found out...
\par EM:\tab Do you remember when that was?
\par MF:\tab It must have been maybe March, February or March \rquote 43, somewhere around there.
\par EM:\tab No, no, or \lquote 42.
\par MF:\tab In \lquote 42 I lost my father. My father went to the Jewish }{\i\f0 Gemeinde}{\f0 , the Jewish community house, for something, and on the way the Nazis came in with trucks from both sides, cut off a block. The Jewish 
policemen stopped my father. A Jewish police\-man. They put him on a truck; we never saw him again. And I was at the }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0 . I came home. My mother said, \ldblquote Father is gone.\rdblquote  Just like that.
\par EM:\tab That was in 1942\'85?
\par MF:\tab \lquote 42, in the summer, when it started. Anyway...it must have been, it could have been \lquote 42 also, or yeah. So we started to, you know see, smell some horrible things. B}{\f0 e}{\f0 
cause now, the Germans were fooling us very beautiful. One day, we had a group, as I mentioned, about 100, 120 people. Two or three guys, two guys didn\rquote t go to work, b}{\f0 e}{\f0 
cause they had to buy, there was a black market there. They had to buy some stuff to have, you know, to take it out the next day. So they stayed in the ghetto. And that day then, when we went out to work, a lot of peopl
e went out to work, the Germans came in and grabbed the Jews who were there and sent them away to Treblinka. They grabbed them, too. And the next day we are working on the railroad station and these two guys are walking toward us. We said, \ldblquote 
Hey! Where\rquote d you come from?\rdblquote  They said, \ldblquote From hell. Let\rquote s go on the side and talk. You won\rquote t believe it.\rdblquote 
 They went to Treblinka. They were unloading, they saw the whole, the devil, they saw the whole thing, the Commandant in the white uniform, the\'85
\par EM:\tab A white uni-...
\par MF:\tab He was in a white uniform, near the dig}{\b\f0  }{\f0 outs, where they, the mass graves, were full of dead bodies.
\par EM:\tab The mass gr-...
\par MF:\tab They were burning. There was a light there. It was just like Dante\rquote s }{\i\f0 Inferno}{\f0 . That it looked like. And they were unloading the 
people so they, and they had to undress right there, and they were shot. So they hid. They were smart two kids. And they hid in the clothes. And they put the, the Germans put the clothes back on the train. So they smuggled themselves in somehow on the tra
i
n, and that train was going back with the stuff to Berlin. So they were passing through Warsaw, and it was only one guard in the front and on the back. So when they saw through the little window where they are, they saw us working, and they jumped out of 
the train. So they told us what happened, what\rquote s going on. \ldblquote They\rquote re killing everybody!\rdblquote  This is no baloney what he\rquote s saying. So we said, \ldblquote That\rquote s it. Now we better start organizing. We\rquote 
re not gonna go like sheep to the slaug}{\f0 h}{\f0 ter.\rdblquote  So we started to build the 
bunker, and we started to buy guns, whoever could. When we bought our guns, and the next day, yeah, how did we get a gun into the ghetto? If you knew some Polish fellows, how many bullets you think you could get. So we were a}{\f0 l}{\f0 
lowed to take in a two-pound bread and some, a pound of...two pounds of potatoes, something like that. So they baked the gun into the bread, with the bullets. That\rquote s how I did. So we smuggled it like this. This was allowed, so they didn\rquote 
t check that. The next day, General Stroop I think it was, that man who liquidated the ghetto, pulls on the gate and says, \ldblquote Cut the bread. The Jews have guns in there.\rdblquote  He knew it the very next day. We didn\rquote 
t know how. If they would have caught us the day before, we would have been all shot on the gate. 
And then we started to build the bunker on Stawki Street, right there next to the, you know, in the ghetto. The first was a big ghetto. Then, when they moved everybody out then, I mean it was a, that big. When they moved out there was a smaller ghetto, a 
little ghetto here, and the big one here. So they moved everybody here and that was }{\i\f0 Niemandsland}{\f0 . It means nobody lived there, all right?
\par EM:\tab The wild ghetto.
\par MF:\tab So, yeah, so we are all in the wild ghetto. So we built our bunker on Stawki Street, which was right to the street which was }{\i\f0 Niemandsland}{\f0 
. And we built that tunnel into the house, under the street, under the house, into a kitchen somewhere, in case our bunker is burning or something, we will be able to escape. We\rquote ll be on the wild ghetto side and nobody, we had nothing to}{\b\f0  }{
\f0 do with the uprising.
\par EM:\tab So Stawki was still in the big ghetto? It wasn\rquote t in the wild ghetto? [unclear].
\par MF:\tab It was the border of it. Half of it was in the ghetto and half of it wasn\rquote t.
\par EM:\tab So it wasn\rquote t.
\par MF:\tab So that\rquote s on [unclear]. So we were building it for, for...
\par EM:\tab Oh, excuse me, the half that wasn\rquote t in the ghetto, you mean it wasn\rquote t in the ghetto or was the wild ghetto?
\par MF:\tab No, that was in the ghetto.
\par EM:\tab It was in the ghetto, was in the wild ghetto.
\par MF:\tab In the ghetto, with a tunnel under the, into the wild ghetto.
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab So, and the women were making }{\i\f0 suchary}{\f0 , you know, all kinds of, what do you call }{\i\f0 suchary}{\f0 ?
\par EM:\tab Biscuits?
\par MF:\tab Biscuits, those things which could last long. And they were buying flour. You know, we were a group of about, you know, twenty people, maybe more. And some little cots, you know, so you, so maybe we could...
\par EM:\tab Tell me, was your mother with you at that time?
\par MF:\tab Yes. My mother was...
\par EM:\tab Who was with you? Who of your family was with you...
\par MF:\tab My mother and my sister, and my brother and his wife\emdash Joe, and his wife.
\par EM:\tab And you...
\par MF:\tab Isaac was already gone.
\par EM:\tab You were all, you...
\par MF:\tab We were all then in one, we all lived in this same house, on Mila 7. We had one little apartment there.
\par EM:\tab And the bunker? Who was building the bunker?
\par MF:\tab We were, the guys from the }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0 .
\par EM:\tab And that was prepared for the guys and their families from the }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0 ?

\par EM:\tab Or just, or...
\par MF:\tab That\rquote s right. No, no...
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab From, for everybody and their family. So we were...
\par EM:\tab How...
\par MF:\tab A small group of about twenty, twenty-five people.
\par EM:\tab How large was the bunker?
\par MF:\tab Now how large could it be? It had about two or three rooms. What could we put there? We had to keep sacks of flour and the }{\i\f0 suchary}{\f0 
 and things like this. Whatever we could, we built it. But how do you build a wall? How do you get out? How do you get in? So we, some genius, he had a great idea. There was a wall in the basement, down in the basement. So we took that c}{\i\f0 egly}{\f0 
, the...now how do you call }{\i\f0 cegly}{\f0 ? Bricks.

\par MF:\tab Oh yes. So where you put the bricks on there, the bricks were exactly fitting the wall, the hole in the wall. So we put it back in and when you looked from the outside, then it was closed. Didn\rquote t see anything.
\par EM:\tab That was on the rails?
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab On the rails.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, but not here. On the inside it}{\b\f0  }{\f0 was.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, uh huh.
\par MF:\tab We went through the wall and closed, right?
\par EM:\tab Uh huh.
\par MF:\tab So that\rquote s how we could go in and out.
\par EM:\tab So you could just push the whole thing.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. It was on two little rails. It was an ingenious guy to figure that out. Be\-cause we were afraid to tell everybody else. Because the idea was, if they\rquote re gonna di}{\f0 s}{\f0 cover one bunker and they\rquote ll say, \ldblquote 
You wanna live? Tell where the others are.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab That\rquote s right.
\par MF:\tab Right? So it was always}{\b\f0  }{\f0 secret. So when somebody said it was the leader of the uprising, it\rquote 
s not so much of a leader [unclear]. There were groups, several groups. Because one was afraid that the other will say, when they catch him. So I don\rquote t know how you
 can call it a leader. It was just self-defense more than an uprising. And of course we were all waiting for them when they came in, then people were lying on roofs and they started to shoot. And they found out that a bullet kills a Nazi just as well as i
t
 kills a Jew, that a Superman gets also killed. And he was dead. And they were running back pretty fast. And then they came with artillery, with tanks, with air force. So how long could you last? Well then we got out. The bunker started to burn, and we go
t out into the }{\i\f0 Niemandsland}{\f0  there. We were hiding for a while, and then they finally caught us, and we went together with the people who were inside to Majdanek.
\par EM:\tab So who was caught of your family? Who was in your, in the bunker? It was your mother and your sister or not?
\par MF:\tab No, my mother was already, my mother was gone already. What am I saying? My mother was gone on Jan-, my mother and my sister, on January 18th. It was a Mo}{\f0 n}{\f0 day afternoon. They came in, and we were all hiding in our apartment, together

here they kept us. And they built a railroad tracks to that school. Then when the railroad people saw that we didn\rquote t come to work, and so from the others, too, from, the Air Force had some people working there. So they ran and they said, 
\ldblquote We must have these people work, back to work. Otherwise the railroad cannot function.\rdblquote  We were in a basement. I remember there was a policeman there\emdash I could see his legs walking along, a Polish policeman\emdash 
so I called him in Polish. I said, \ldblquote I want to talk to you.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Oh zyd sedziesz namydlo?}{\f0 \rdblquote }{\i\f0  }{\f0  [They\rquote re gonna make soap out of you.] He didn\rquote

ing. Professor Filar, I want to go back a little bit in time. And you had mentioned before that you played the concert in the ghetto. Could you tell me a little bit about it?
\par MF:\tab Oh sure. And I think it should be brought out, because hardly anybody me}{\f0 n}{\f0 tions that, or maybe people don\rquote t know it. I don\rquote 
t know. There was a movie house built in Warsaw just before the war; they finished it, and they were not allowed to open it up b}{\f0 e}{\f0 cause it was one foot I think too close to a church. And it was on Leszno Street...the movie house was in Leszno}{
\b\f0  }{\f0 R\'f3g Solna. And the church was on Leszno}{\b\f0  }{\f0 R\'f3g}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
Karmelicka, I think it was. And it was just one foot or two feet too close and they never opened it up. In the ghetto nobody came to the church, I guess.  So they opened it up 
and, not as a movie, but as a concert hall. And we, a lot of musicians, some were members of the Wa}{\f0 r}{\f0 saw Philharmonic played, and we had a wonderful conductor. His name was Marian}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
Neuteich who was a fine, very fine viol-, eh, cellist. And he was a cellist for the radio symphony. So they created a symphony orche}{\f0 s}{\f0 tra.
\par EM:\tab Where, did you know the conductor before the war? Or did you...

t have the music. So we smuggled the music from the Polish side, over the wall I think they told me, because the orchestra did that. They had colleagues in the orchestra in the Philharmonic, from the Warsaw Philharmonic. So they got the music an
d we played the Concerto. I remember my parents and my sister Helen were in the audience. So, there were also chamber music concerts on Orla Street. That was, I remember now, I forgot that name completely, it just came to me. And there was a great young
\emdash he was maybe two years younger than I\emdash violinist by the name of David Zaider, blessed memory, a wonderful talent. And we played chamber music together, piano violin sonatas. He was murdered. And there was a great singer, a fantastic talented
}{\b\f0  }{\f0 girl, Marysia}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Eiz
enstadt, whose father was a conductor of the Great Synagogue Choir. And I sang in that choir when I was a kid. And my father was a member of that synagogue. So, of course, and Marysia was also murdered, you know. And so all this disappeared. But I think i
t should be mentioned that in all hell, in this kind of a hell, the Jews still had a symphony orchestra. And it\rquote s first, hardly mentioned an}{\f0 y}{\f0 where. And I think that\rquote s why I want to emphasize it, emphasize it, and emphasize it, b}
{\f0 e}{\f0 cause it\rquote s unfair not to mention this kind of a great organization, in this kind of a hell.
\par EM:\tab Could you tell me a little more about who organized it?
\par MF:\tab This I don\rquote t know, because I came to Warsaw in \lquote 41. I was away. So when I came back, they were already in existence. So I had no idea who did it.
\par EM:\tab How often did the concerts take place?
\par MF:\tab Well I don\rquote t remember exactly. There weren\rquote t many, because I came in \lquote 41, in December. And in \rquote 42 in August, August 17}{\f0\super th}{\f0 , I think it was, I already lost my father. So it was just a few months

\par MF:\tab I guess they paid them something. They probably paid them something for it. Who had money then? You know, everybody was impoverished.
\par EM:\tab All right. I know that there were many musicians even in the streets, street mus}{\f0 i}{\f0 cians...
\par MF:\tab Right.
\par EM:\tab In 1942. All right, so you lost your father in August of 1942?
\par MF:\tab August 17th, 1942. He went to the Jewish }{\i\f0 Gemeinde}{\f0 , I mean to some, for something. I don\rquote t know what, and then he never came back. And we heard that the Nazis came with trucks on both side
s of the block, cut the block off, and that was it. Whoever was on the street they grabbed them, put them on a truck and sent them away and killed them.
\par EM:\tab Now I...
\par MF:\tab Just like that, like you never had a father. And you couldn\rquote t react. You could...I don\rquote t know, blow up, that he can\rquote t, the impotence! You can not do anything!
\par EM:\tab And your mother was taken later? You know...
\par MF:\tab Yeah. My mother...
\par EM:\tab You told me...
\par MF:\tab And my sister Helen.
\par EM:\tab You were at the }{\i\f0 Umschlagplatz}{\f0 .
\par MF:\tab Right.
\par EM:\tab You mentioned you were at the }{\i\f0 Umschlagplatz}{\f0 .
\par MF:\tab That was January 18th, 1943.
\par EM:\tab And you got out from the }{\i\f0 Umschlag-}{\f0 , away from the }{\i\f0 Umschlagplatz}{\f0 ?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, that\rquote s right. But I didn\rquote t want to get out. And it was quite a very tragic story for me, because we went there, we stayed over night. And in the morning\emdash 
I worked for the railroad station, so the Germans from the railroad station came in\emdash and they said, \ldblquote We need the workers. Otherwise the railroad won\rquote t work.\rdblquote  You know, and they raised hell. So they said, \ldblquote 
Today we let out the men. Tomorrow we\rquote re letting out the women.\rdblquote  So I said\emdash my oldest brother was there, too, and my mother and my sister, and my oldest brother\rquote s wife, the three women and two of us\emdash so he said, 
\ldblquote Come on! Let\rquote s go. They\rquote ll come.\rdblquote   I said, \ldblquote No, I don\rquote t believe it. I don\rquote t want to go.\rdblquote 
 And I was crying, and holding onto my mother. And he grabbed me, and my mother pushed me and says, \ldblquote Go! You\rquote ll be a great pianist. We\rquote ll be very proud of you. And we\rquote ll come tomorrow. Don\rquote t worry about it.\rdblquote 
 Somehow, my brother pulled me away. And I cried. I didn\rquote t want to, I really didn\rquote t want to go. And it\rquote s eating me all those years. And sometimes I don\rquote t even want to say it, because it\rquote 
s my private tragedy. And my mother said, \ldblquote I bless you.\rdblquote  [pause; tape off then on] \ldblquote Come on! They\rquote ll let them out tomorrow!\rdblquote 
 So we went to work. Came tomorrow, we went to work, we came back, and there was still a lock on my, on the apartment where I was with my mother and my sister. They never came back. [pause; weeping]
\par EM:\tab So they went on a transport probably the same day.
\par MF:\tab And we stayed overnight. I remember in the basement of that, see, I was there now. Just a couple of months ago I went there with my nephew. And I said, \ldblquote That\rquote s where I saw my mother for the last time, down there in that basement.
\rdblquote  The school is still there. It was a public school. They just built it before the war. And the Germans built the railroad tracks...[sighs]
\par EM:\tab Professor Filar is overcome by emotion, so we will interrupt the interview for a while. [tape off then on]
\par MF:\tab Yeah, [unclear]. And you saw a picture how beautiful she was. I call her beautiful. [weeping] I never called her mother. I always called her beautiful. My sister would say, \ldblquote Are you calling me?\rdblquote  I\rquote d say, \ldblquote 
Shut up, you know better.\rdblquote  [laughs] And my mother laughed.
\par EM:\tab Well, your mother was a beautiful woman.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, she was beautiful inside and outside. [weeping; tape off then on] ...to be such murderers! Who would believe it?
\par EM:\tab Where did you, so you went back to work, to your }{\i\f0 Plac\'f3wka}{\f0  from there.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. And then what happened was, I got in touch with my teacher. And he said, \ldblquote We have a place for you. You\rquote re gonna be hidden.\rdblquote  Do you have it on? [pause] He,
 they sent a colonel, a Polish colonel, who was an uncle of a colleague of mine, Levitsky was his name. He came to the railroad station to Warsaw West. And I gave him a picture. And he got me a }{\i\f0 Kennkarte}{\f0 , [identity card] a false }{\i\f0 
Kennkarte}{\f0 . And he said, he came in and he said, \ldblquote It\rquote ll be ready in a day.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I would like, I cannot go out till I have one, for my brother\rdblquote  that was my oldest brother. He\rquote 
s alive. He lives near Washington now. He\rquote s alive. He\rquote s 93 years old. We were seven kids and, I was the one that was born, I don\rquote t}{\b\f0  }{\f0 know}{\b\f0  }{\f0 how many years later. By the}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
way. I was an accident. And so, and I was su}{\f0 p}{\f0 posed to be hidden in a }{\i\f0 hrabia}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 potocki}{\f0 , [count] I mean }{\i\f0 dobra}{\f0 , [estate] you know, in some estate near Lublin somewhere. And there was also hidden somebo
dy else I heard after the war, Prokurator Sawicky, [public prosecutor] who hanged all the Nazis in Majdanek. Have you ever heard that name?
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab Sawicky. His name was Jerzyk Reisler. His father-in-law was a very famous lawyer in Lemberg by the name of Leib Landau, who defended, that was }{\i\f0 Proces}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Steigera}{\f0 . [law suit] It was...
\par EM:\tab But I don\rquote t remember that.
\par MF:\tab That was a, you remember something like this?
\par EM:\tab No.
\par MF:\tab He was a very famous lawyer. So he changed his name, married a Polish Catholic woman, and he was there. Then I heard that they raided the place and they found him or he escaped, something. Well, anyway, so I didn\rquote 
t go because I waited for the documents for my brother. Meantime the uprising broke out. Now, but we were already building, we had our bunker already. I think I showed you how we got in...
\par EM:\tab Yes.
\par MF:\tab And how we got out.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab With that little thing on the rails.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, you...
\par MF:\tab Yeah, and then we were outside in the wild ghetto, and that\rquote s how they caught us. So we said, \ldblquote We had nothing to do with the uprising.\rdblquote  You know, we were, and they took us together with everybody else to Majdanek, to }{
\i\f0 Block}{\f0  16. Now that was a }{\i\f0 Feld drei}{\f0 , mean field number three, and the }{\i\f0 Block}{\f0  was 16. And I was there, in \lquote 
92 I was there. And I went to see it. I had a student of mine with me and I played with the Philharmonic. After it was done we hired a car, and we went to Majdanek.
\par EM:\tab Yeah. My, that was in 1992.
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab Could we go back to your arrival in Majdanek? What was your impression? What did you  know about Majdanek?
\par MF:\tab Oh, we got a special treat, because we were the uprisers from the Warsaw Ghetto. They put us in the }{\i\f0 Block}{\f0  16. And there were about, I don\rquote t know, there were plenty of }{\i\f0 Blocks}{\f0  on each side. There was a }{\i\f0 
Block}{\f0  here and a }{\i\f0 Block}{\f0  there. And they put a fence around that }{\i\f0 Block}{\f0 . So, everyone knew who the uprisers are there. And we got sp}{\f0 e}{\f0 
cial treatment. That means they woke you up in the morning with a baseball bat. And if you\rquote re not out of bed af
ter the whistle, a second later they were in the barrack and they were killing people. Just killing. So, we were there, I was there nine weeks. And I was a}{\f0 l}{\f0 ready, I was just about ready for the garbage can.
\par EM:\tab Did you work at that time?
\par MF:\tab Yes. When you say work...
\par EM:\tab What...
\par MF:\tab We were beaten to death. They were just trying to kill us, that\rquote s all. Anyway, so what happened was, I became friendly with a Polish fellow, by the name of Antek. He was a foreman or something. I don\rquote t know. He was in the barrac
ks there. Of course there were...
\par EM:\tab Now was he also a prisoner? An inmate?
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab He was an inmate.
\par MF:\tab Sure. He was an inmate. But he knew something was going on, so he saw me how I was, I couldn\rquote t get in that barrack. I had to pull myself by the door handle. I was down already, I don\rquote 
t know how many pounds. I was barely alive. And I was a young kid. So he said to me, \ldblquote You\rquote re not gonna live much longer.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote I heard that they\rquote re coming from la
bor camps, so you better get out of here. You just report, and they\rquote ll take you to a labor camp and there you could survive. But here it\rquote s just the end.\rdblquote  So, a couple of days later they came, Brown Shirts came, we didn\rquote 
t know from where. I think that they were from Czestochowa. Later on we found out. So 
I ran to the kitchen where my brother worked. He got himself a job, Julek got himself a job, my oldest brother, who is alive, got himself a job in the kitchen. He was peeling potatoes. He was eating raw potatoes. And I found out that you can eat them and 
it won\rquote t harm you. I didn\rquote t know that. So I ran to him. I said, I knew, I told him what this fellow said. I said, \ldblquote I\rquote ll let you know.\rdblquote  So I ran and said, \ldblquote Let\rquote s go.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote I
\rquote m not going.\rdblquote  I says, \ldblquote What do you mean?\rdblquote  \ldblquote I don\rquote t want to go.\rdblquote  I says, \ldblquote Why not?\rdblquote  \ldblquote It doesn\rquote t rain on me here. I\rquote m eating raw potatoes. N}{\f0 o}
{\f0 body beats me. How long I\rquote ll live, I\rquote ll live. I\rquote ll die anyway, so what\rquote s, I don\rquote t want to go.\rdblquote  So I didn\rquote t go either. The next day Antek sees me. He says, \ldblquote What the hell? Why didn\rquote 
t you go?\rdblquote  So I told him what happened. He says, \ldblquote He doesn\rquote t want to go? So he stays, and you go. Because you\rquote re gonna die here. Get out of here! I\rquote ll kill you if you don\rquote t go with the next one, because they
\rquote re coming again.\rdblquote  So I told him this. The next day, it might be 
a day or two later, they came. This one was, later on I found out it was from Skarzysko-Kamienna. It was a labor camp there. So I ran to him again, and before he said something I said, \ldblquote If you\rquote re not going, I\rquote 
m going by myself. Because I\rquote m gonna die. And you\rquote re gonna die, too.\rdblquote  So he...I finally yelled at him so he threw the apron and said, \ldblquote Oh what the hell, I\rquote m going.\rdblquote 
 So we went into a group. We were about maybe four or five or, three, four hundred people. I didn\rquote t count them, I don\rquote t know, a big, big gr
oup of people. We stood in a row of five. And I had swollen legs, and the ankles were swollen from hunger. So they were Brown Shirts. So, first they said that you had to run about twenty, thirty meters. Because who fell was too weak. They don\rquote 
t want to take weak pe}{\f0 o}{\f0 ple to work. It was supposed to be a labor camp, work on ammu\-nition or something. I didn\rquote t fall. I made it. I was, so I figure, I made it. Not so fast. So, they threw these, they didn\rquote 
t kill them, they just threw, they killed them all later. So they threw them out. Then they, these Brown Shirts went again to the front of the group, and I was like in the mi}{\f0 d}{\f0 
dle. There were five in a row and I was right in the middle of those five. Two on my left, two on my right. He goes up in the front and said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Hosenhoch}{\f0 !\rdblquote  Pull up your pants. So whoever had swollen legs, \ldblquote }{
\i\f0 Raus}{\f0 ,\rdblquote  threw them out. So I said, \ldblquote That\rquote s the end of me.\rdblquote  I had swollen ankles. How did I get out? And that was a God\rquote s miracle. You won\rquote t believe this. I don\rquote 
t believe it myself. He comes to my row just about ready, he had a row, the five in front of me, went forward. They had, no
body had swollen legs, so they made it. He just about opened his mouth and an S.S. man knocks on his shoulder. He wants to talk to him. So he turns around, and they started to talk. So I said to the fellow in front of me, \ldblquote You don\rquote 
t have swollen legs. Change with me. You\rquote ll make it again, and they\rquote ll throw me out.\rdblquote  So he says, \ldblquote I don\rquote t want to. I\rquote m afraid.\rdblquote  So, guys heard it around, so they said, \ldblquote Change! There
\rquote s a life to be saved! If you don\rquote t change, we\rquote ll kill you!\rdblquote  So they scared the hell out of him and we changed in a second. And the moment we changed he, this...Brown Shirt changed around and said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 
Hosenhoch}{\f0 !\rdblquote  He pulled these pants up again and he got out and I got out. That\rquote s how I got out. Wasn\rquote t that a miracle?
\par EM:\tab [unclear]
\par MF:\tab I\rquote m trembling when I hear it. When I think about it that a few weeks later they machine gunned everybody there. So we got to Skarzysko-Kamienna. There\rquote s another chapter. We came in there
 and well, I was pretty weak. My brother was all right, because he was in the kitchen. And we, there were three-, }{\i\f0 Werker}{\f0 , that means three branches of }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0 , A }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0 , B }{\i\f0 Werk\'85 }{\f0 A, B, and C. I don
\rquote t know what }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0  means in English, fact}{\f0 o}{\f0 ries.}{\b\f0 
\par }{\f0 EM:\tab Factories.
\par MF:\tab Factories A, factory B and C. C was a killer, because they made some yellow stuff, the }{\i\f0 trotti}{\f0 , and they would all turn yellow. Their clothes were yellow, their faces were yellow, and they died. Somehow we got into }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0 
 A. And we stand there and wait, whatever it is. A group comes from work, and I see a colleague of mine from when I was at Conse}{\f0 r}{\f0 vatory, Irene, who lives now in New York. 
\par EM:\tab A what? A colleague?
\par MF:\tab A colleague, a Jewish girl. She was a foreman. She spoke German. She got German, she had German in high school. I had French. She looked at me and said, \ldblquote Boy, how do you look like? It\rquote s horrible!\rdblquote  So she said, 
\ldblquote I know somebody who gives, who is giving out a soup. So I\rquote ll talk to him and you\rquote ll get an extra portion.\rdblquote  So I got an extra portion and my brother, he got. Then we, so he said, \ldblquote Report here. Otherwise you
\rquote ll be on }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0  C; they\rquote ll kill you.\rdblquote  So she told me I have }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0  A, I mean that factory A. So we were put in there and we made it. So we got to }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0  A. Then came, and we got a job. I sat in

\par MF:\tab In a big hall. And I was sitting there and cutting, it\rquote s called }{\i\f0 St\'fctzringe}{\f0 . I don\rquote t know how it is in English. They were, a double things like this, like if you, those two glasses, and you cut i
t in the middle, they became two parts, from one.
\par EM:\tab What was it, metal? Was...
\par MF:\tab It, yeah, metal. It looked like maybe a part for a machine gun or something. I don\rquote t know. But I was, remember when I had to go to the men\rquote s room, it must have been like from here almost to the road here, maybe a little closer.

\par EM:\tab [unclear].
\par MF:\tab It took me forever to make it. And I saw it, where the guys were walking fast. I said, \ldblquote Did I used to walk that fast?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I was walking like them.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab Yes.
\par MF:\tab And they said, \ldblquote The younger Filar is gonna kick the bucket. It won\rquote t take too long.\rdblquote  In the meantime another miracle happened. I once got a, an extra portion of ma}{\f0 r}{\f0 malade. I don\rquote 
t know, remember how, but I got it. I knew that marmalade doesn\rquote t have much nourishment. I wanted to have bread for it. So I wanted to sell it. }{\i\f0 Werk}{\f0  A wasn\rquote t, where we worked it were not so, it was called }{\i\f0 Automaten}{
\f0 , automatic. We were working on automat-, and the Polacks were also working there because that was a Polish mun}{\f0 i}{\f0 tions factory before the war. So they still worked there.
\par EM:\tab This was in Skarzysko-Kamienna?
\par MF:\tab Yeah. So the Poles went home, and we went to the barracks. So we had co}{\f0 n}{\f0 tact with the outside world through them. But I didn\rquote t think that anybody will do, you know, t
hey were eating their soup. But it was a next barrack, they were }{\i\f0 Narzedziownia }{\f0 
used to be called, and the Polacks were a little richer there. And I heard that they brought their soup from home and they were selling their soup. So I sold my marmalade. I got a whole }{\i\f0 zloty}{\f0 
 for it. And there was a break, a lunch break. So I went over to }{\i\f0 Narzedziownia}{\b\i\f0  }{\f0 and I asked one of the fellows working by, so I said, \ldblquote Which of the Poles here sells his soup?\rdblquote  So he shows me a, on a corner there
\rquote s a man there. And he is not eating. He is selling it. So I went up to him and I asked him in Polish, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Pan te}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 zupe sprzedal}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  So he looks at me and says, \ldblquote 
How come you speak so perfect Polish?\rdblquote  That was the first i}{\f0 m}{\f0 pression. So I said, \ldblquote Well, how come you do? Did you go to school? So did I. What\rquote s the big deal?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Eat that soup. I don\rquote 
t want your money. Come every day.\rdblquote  So, he kind of got to like me. He used to even give me a little piece of black bread once in a while. So he asked me what I was doing, so I told him. But he, we worked one
 week a day shift, one week night shift. He worked only day shift. So I only saw him one week, and then the second week I didn\rquote 
t till we came back on day shift. So one day he tells me that he is going to Warsaw because he broke his glasses, and they cannot fit his, fill his prescription in Skarzysko. It\rquote 
s a small town. So he got a permit to ride a train to Warsaw. He said, \ldblquote Give me the address of your teacher, and I\rquote ll go over there and tell him where you are. Maybe he could help.\rdblquote  So I, you know, tore off 
a piece of brown paper from the machine and I said, in Polish I said, \ldblquote }{\i\f32 Uczciwy cz\'b3owiek sam wszystko opowie}{\f0 ,\rdblquote  and I signed my name with a nickname. I had a nickname. They used to call me by a nickname.
\par EM:\tab And what was your nickname?
\par MF:\tab No, it\rquote s not important. Maybe I will tell you.
\par EM:\tab [laughs] O.K.
\par MF:\tab But that was a good sign, you know. And so I signed it. And he went, and then there was a night shift again for me. So I had to wait another week. Finally comes Mo}{\f0 n}{\f0 day at noontime and I...
\par EM:\tab Wait, what was the name of the teacher that he went to see?
\par MF:\tab Zir-, Professor Drzewiecki.

\par EM:\tab That\rquote s right. We\rquote re going to talk about it later.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, O.K. So, anyway, finally came the Monday so I ran over to him. And he came back, this }{\i\f0 Meister}{\f0 . I don\rquote t know his name. I don\rquote

Why are you in a hurry? Eat the soup!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Never mind the soup! Did you see him?\rdblquote  So he takes out a piece of white bread. I said, \ldblquote Hey, you couldn\rquote t afford that.\rdblquote  Yeah, once in a

So what ha}{\f0 p}{\f0 pened?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Well, I went up there...\rdblquote  Now Marszalkowska 17, it\rquote s still there. I saw it when I was there a couple of months ago. We were inside the house. It stays. \ldblquote 
And I knocked on the door. He opened the door himself on the chain.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote I have regards for you from your .student, Marian Filar.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote I never heard of him.\rdblquote  He was afraid. He didn\rquote 
t know who the guy was. Maybe he is a Gestapo agent or something. So he shoved in the little brown paper through the crack in the door. So he looked, \ldblquote Heh! Is he alive? Come on in!\rdblquote  So he opened the door, he says, \ldblquote 
Well, we thought he is already dead.\rdblquote  \ldblquote No, no. He is in Skarzysko-Kamienna working there, you know, as a slave.\rdblquote 
 So he gave him his suit. He gave him a couple of shirts. He gave him his shoes. And I wore, I was wearing those wooden, Dutch shoes, you know?
\par EM:\tab Yes.
\par MF:\tab They weigh a ton a shoe. And with the little swollen legs, it was a killer. You had to drag like this to walk. And he gave him, what else he gave him? I know, a lot of things. And he came back. So he said, \ldblquote I\rquote 
ll bring you the shoes, but I can\rquote t bring two at the same time because I\rquote m also searched. So I\rquote ll bring you one tomorrow and one the day after.\rdblquote  And he gave him some money, too, I think. I said, \ldblquote Don\rquote 
t bring me the suit. What, I\rquote m gonna dress in a suit? They\rquote ll hang me. Sell it, and we\rquote ll get some food for it.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab So he did that. Then I got a contact, yeah, and some of the Jewish fellows were warning me. They said, \ldblquote You\rquote re dealing with that guy? He\rquote 
s a thief! He is stealing! They sent him to, they got some gold or something and he said he never found it, wha}{\f0 t}{\f0 ever.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I don\rquote t have any problem whatsoever, nothing.\rdblquote 
 Then he contacted some other people, and once I got, through this fellow, he sent 500 }{\i\f0 zlotys}{\f0 . That was a fortune! We count it in bread. And a beautiful letter from a mother of a st
udent of mine, Marisha Sobel was her name. She lives in California now, and her mother is dead. They were Catholics, Polacks. And she sent me 500 }{\i\f0 zlotys}{\f0 . So, and a beautiful letter. So I went to the men\rquote 
s room. My brother was standing in front of the door of that men\rquote s room. And I sat down, you know, pretending that I\rquote 
m sitting. And I read it and I cried and I put it down and pulled the chain. And then we could, so we started to eat better. And all of a sudden the guy that was selling food says, \ldblquote That younger Filar is looking better. We thought he\rquote 
s gonna kick the bucket. Look! He looks better! He must have some contact from the ou}{\f0 t}{\f0 side.\rdblquote  You know? And I got back on my feet, but it took a while. Anyway, then...
\par EM:\tab How long were you in Skarzysko-Kamienna?
\par MF:\tab Oh, that was maybe fourteen months. Wait a minute, well, I was nine weeks in Majdanek. They took us there in \lquote 43, in May, I think it was. So May, June, May, let\rquote s say June, July, it\rquote 
s in July or August. They took us from Skarzysko to Buchenwald, because the front was getting closer. That was \lquote 44 already.
\par EM:\tab Oh. So you were how many months you said? Several months in Skarzysko-Kamienna?
\par MF:\tab Oh, about fourteen months.
\par EM:\tab Fourteen months, yeah.
\par MF:\tab It was twelve, fourteen, something like that. And we arrived in Buchenwald. First we arrived at the station called Weimar, like the house, the city of G\'f6the.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab And there was a sign. Now we were now about fifty in a car. We didn\rquote t have any luggage. We just had our uniform, you know [unclear].
\par EM:\tab And were the Poles also moved or only the Jews? Did they take only the Jews to Buchenwald? Because the front was...
\par MF:\tab I know, I was only in company of the Jews. So those who were in the uniform. We used to call that Hitler\rquote s tails.
\par EM:\tab Yeah. What, with the striped uniforms?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, that\rquote s right. So, when we arrived in Buchenwald, and I see a sign sa}{\f0 y}{\f0 ing, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Elf}{\f0  kilometers now to Buchenwald, eleven kilometers now to Buchenwald.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Fellas, let\rquote 
s have a feast. Where is something to eat? That\rquote s it. Tomorrow you\rquote re gonna be all dead.\rdblquote  In the meantime the German, the S.S. comes out to the windows, through that little windows. They knock on the door and said, \ldblquote 
Do you have any Polish }{\i\f0 zlotys}{\f0 ? We\rquote ll buy them from you. We\rquote ll give you food. Where you\rquote re going...\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab Well, where were you, in some barracks?
\par MF:\tab No, we were still on the train.
\par EM:\tab Oh, in the train.
\par MF:\tab At the station in Weimar.
\par EM:\tab All right.
\par MF:\tab And he said, \ldblquote We\rquote re going back for, to bring other transports, so we\rquote ll take your }{\i\f0 zlotys}{\f0  which you have, if you have any with you, and we\rquote ll give you bread for it.\rdblquote 
 They were dealing, doing business with us, the S.S.
\par EM:\tab They were S.S. men.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. So, what do you have to do? We gave it, whoever had some got some extra bread. And then we got to Buchenwald, and we saw Buchenwald says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Arbeit Macht Frei}{\f0 .\rdblquote  That\rquote s a very famous line, \ldblquote 
Work Makes You Free.\rdblquote  Free to go to hell. Free to get killed. And so we came in there, but they didn\rquote t take us into the regular camp. They took us in the so-called }{\i\f0 Zeltlager}{\f0 . T
hat was a, we were in transit. So we were there about ten days. }{\i\f0 Zeltlager}{\f0  means a, a }{\i\f0 Zelt}{\f0  is a, well you know what a...[tape off then on] [u}{\f0 n}{\f0 clear].
\par EM:\tab [unclear], yeah, but...
\par MF:\tab Yeah, that was that little, little place...
\par EM:\tab The }{\i\f0 Zeltlager}{\f0  was tents.
\par MF:\tab With tents, yeah, tents. Because we were already factory workers, ammun}{\f0 i}{\f0 tion. We were professionals. So we just came there to be }{\i\f0 entlaust}{\f0 
, that means take the lice out if we have any, and steal everything what we accumulated maybe. And by the way when I put my teacher\rquote s shoes on, they were ideal. We had the same size shoe. I didn\rquote 
t know it. And all of a sudden, getting out of those Dutch wooden shoes, which weighed a ton each, with my legs, you know, and getting into the regular shoes, and all of a sudden I felt like I\rquote m walking on a cloud. I couldn\rquote 
t believe it. It was just like heaven. By God, I\rquote ll never forget it. So, and then we didn\rquote t see any S.S. in that }{\i\f0 Zeltlager}{\f0 . Who came in? Well, you know, there were people, members of government. Leon Blum was t
here. Daladier was there. There were some clergy there from all over Europe. And that }{\i\f0 Zeltlager}{\f0  was run by high political prisoners. You know, people of, from different governments. And they came to us and they said, \ldblquote 
You are not gonna stay here. They gonna send you to a}{\f0 n}{\f0 other camp where you\rquote re gonna produce some ammunition, whatever, because you\rquote re a}{\f0 l}{\f0 ready considered professional factory work
ers, munition workers. So if you have any collaborators among you, we\rquote ll set up here a democratic court, and they\rquote ll be convicted, and you\rquote ll go without them because they\rquote 
ll be drinking your blood all over again if you take them along wherever you go.\rdblquote  So somebody got up and pointed out to a police chief and another guy\emdash there were two guys\emdash and I was at, I witnessed the court and I knew one, the }{

\par MF:\tab So there was a tr-...
\par EM:\tab Was it a }{\i\f0 Kapo}{\f0 ?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, something like this. But then the }{\i\f0 Magazinier}{\f0  I remember the winter came and he\rquote 
s still in Skarzysko. And Irene introduced me to him. She knew him. So that started to get very cold. So I went in there, and he had, they had coats and all kinds of things. So I said, \ldblquote Give me a coat for the winter.\rdblquote 
 So he gave me a three-quarter coat. I said, \ldblquote How about my brother?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote I don\rquote t have anything for your brother. The brother! Every time I send somebody over they say \lquote Your brother\rquote .\rdblquote 
 I said, \ldblquote Yeah, he is my brother.\rdblquote  So he said, \ldblquote I don\rquote t have any for your brother.\rdblquote  I took off the coat, I says, \ldblquote Keep this one too. The hell with you. I\rquote m gonna walk out with this and he
\rquote ll freeze to death?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Come back! Come back!\rdblquote  He gave me a coat for my brother. But he also had shoes and things and they were digging into those clothes because ther
e were, all kinds of, people were hiding their gold and diamonds, whatever. So when we arrived in Buchenwald, I want to tell you this, and we\rquote re sitting there waiting to get into the shower, we didn\rquote t know if it\rquote 
s gonna be a shower or it\rquote s gonna be gas. So, people who were a}{\f0 l}{\f0 ready in camp in the uniforms, in the striped uni-, we were also in striped uniforms but, so they were showing us, \ldblquote Don\rquote t worry. You\rquote 
re gonna have water. We know. Because you\rquote re gonna work. You know, so you don\rquote t have to worry about it.\rdblquote 
 So we went into this barrack. We had to undress, completely naked, and there were barbers there. And then it was thousands of people there, lights, you know, and tables. And the S.S. was there. You have to put, so I had my teacher\rquote 
s shoes. I took everything off. I still had the shoes on. Yeah, so before I went to this fellow and I said, \ldblquote Listen, you must have a lot of stuff on you, because you\rquote re the }{\i\f0 Magazinier}{\f0 .\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote 
Give me something. I\rquote ll risk. I\rquote ll, if you have a gold, maybe a gold coin or something and I\rquote ll take it through. If I take it through and they kill me, they\rquote ll kill me anyway. So what\rquote s the difference? And you\rquote 
ll give me something for it, O.K.?\rdblquote  So he gave me a piece of bread with a [unclear] and said, \ldblquote Inside there is a ten dollar gold, an American eagle, ten dollars.\rdblquote 
 So I go back and we sit down and wait and my brother says to me, \ldblquote You\rquote re crazy! They\rquote re gonna kill you! What are you doing?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote What are you going? You think you\rquote re going to a spa? They\rquote 
ll kill me anyway. This way maybe if I get through we\rquote ll get something.\rdblquote 
 We go in there, so they took our, we took our clothes off. And I still had the shoes on, and there was a big table between us, not this wide, but you know, like this. And the S.S. was behind, so I took everything off and he says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0

 could have had a few hundred people. And he would go to the kitchen and order how many people he has on a }{\i\f0 Block}{\f0  and he\rquote 
ll get so much food, so much bread, whatever rations and so on. So he came to us, said the S.S. came to him, because Germans talked to Germans. And he said, \ldblquote We don\rquote t have to be afraid. They are businessmen. They are looking fo
r dollars and gold. And they are going to give us food for it. They\rquote re not gonna kill anybody, not to be afraid.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab That was in Schlieben?
\par MF:\tab In Schlieben. And that was in 1944. The Germans already knew they\rquote re losing the war. So I had my ten dollar gold piece. So I told the }{\i\f0 Block\'e4ltester}{\f0 \emdash he was a decent fellow, I knew him, he was in his 70\rquote 
s then, he was in camp about ten years already\emdash so I said, \ldblquote I have a ten-dollar gold piece. What can I get?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Well, I\rquote ll try the best for you.\rdblquote  So...
\par EM:\tab Excuse me, do you by any chance remember his name?
\par MF:\tab No, I never knew his name.
\par EM:\tab No.
\par MF:\tab He was just }{\i\f0 Block\'e4ltester}{\f0 , period. I know he was from East Germany. Later we, so I\rquote ll tell you this later. So I gave him this ten-dollar gold piece and he brought me,
 we got for three months over there an extra piece of bread, a little bit of marmalade and every other day a little tiny slice of salami, and twenty dollars paper back, change! Would you believe it? They were businessmen! I couldn\rquote 
t believe it! I saw twenty! And my brother kept it.
\par EM:\tab They wanted the gold, so they wanted the gold...

\par MF:\tab Yeah, and we, for about three months we had some extra food. Then, the }{\i\f0 Lagerkommandant}{\f0 , a big tall S.S. man, he came out once. We, and he called, he was looking for dentists. \ldblquote 
Not to worry. I need dentists because I want to set up a dental office here.\rdblquote  And so, we saw that they mean business, whatever it was, so two or three people stood forward. They did it, they opened up a dental...
\par EM:\tab Clinic?
\par MF:\tab Room somewhere and they brought a chair and all this. And the Jewish de}{\f0 n}{\f0 tists were getting into the Hitler mouths, fixing their teeths for free. Would you believe it? So I sneaked in once in a 
while and they looked at my teeth. Otherwise I would have had nothing today. That was one thing. Then the }{\i\f0 Lagerkommandant}{\f0  came out and said, \ldblquote I need a musician.\rdblquote 
 So I started to tremble. The men knew it, so they pointed at me. So I had to step forward. So he says, \ldblquote I want the group to go to work with singing, and I\rquote ll give you the music. You teach them, you pick those who can sing.\rdblquote 
 And I remember some of the songs. We had to go with singing in the morning to the work.
\par EM:\tab Were they all German songs?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, yeah. I remember, some of it I remember. Anyway, and there was one \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Voll M\'e4dchen}{\f0 \rdblquote  and there was one \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Von Schlieben}{\f0 , }{\i\f0 Auf Schlieben Fluten Fand ich den Tod}{\f0 \rdblquote

\f0  [wood chopper] across from the kitchen. I had a ball then.
\par EM:\tab But Schlieben you said was a factory where they made bazookas?
\par MF:\tab Bazookas, yes, that\rquote s right.
\par EM:\tab But you weren\rquote t working with that?
\par MF:\tab Not yet.
\par EM:\tab No.
\par MF:\tab I got a job, I sometimes figured out how, I don\rquote t know, and I got a job on a hall across from the kitchen. And we were sawing wood, cutting juice up, I mean wood for the kitchen. And there were maids there. We didn\rquote 
t know who they were. They were pushing out those big canisters and said, \ldblquote Wash it out.\rdblquote  We were giving them wood. And then I heard some of them speak Polish. I said, \ldblquote Hey! Where you from?\rdblquote  One was from Warsaw. Well
, I know how to talk to a Warsaw girl. Before you knew it she became friends with me. So she said, \ldblquote Bring me your }{\i\f0 menaszka}{\f0 
, I mean that little container where you get your soup. Put it into an S.S. container, a big one, and give it to me. I\rquote ll bring it. I\rquote ll, you give it to me after you\rquote ve washed it out, and I\rquote 
ll steal S.S. food, bring it in that thing, shove it out, tell you to wash it out. You take it in there and you take you some and you have good food.\rdblquote  So I had a ball that way. But then they took us a
way from there and we got a job, oh no, wait a minute. They took us away because we created a sabotage. So we created a sabotage. It was the night shift. I was that time on the day shift. I was sleeping on my bunk bed. And about two o\rquote 
clock in the morning the wall from our ba}{\f0 r}{\f0 rack just flew out, the whole wall. You know, there could have been about twenty, thirty beds there. The whole thing just flew. It was a tremendous explosion. There were hu}{\f0 n}{\f0 
dreds of thousands of tons of ammunition. They created a sabotage and the Germans couldn\rquote t pr}{\f0 o}{\f0 duce a bazooka for about three months.
\par EM:\tab Who took part in that sabotage? Do you...
\par MF:\tab The night shift. I don\rquote t know who.
\par EM:\tab The night shift.
\par MF:\tab Nobody talked. Nobody would say it, in case somebody gets caught and beaten to death to say.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab Nobody knew it. It happened, period.
\par EM:\tab Tell me something. So there were not only Jews working there. There were Poles and other people?
\par MF:\tab No, no, we were Jews. In that camp we were Jews. Just Jews.
\par EM:\tab Because you said you met this one Polish girl.
\par MF:\tab And that was in Majdanek.
\par EM:\tab Oh, that was in Majdanek.
\par MF:\tab In Majdanek. There was a Pole in Majdanek. Thanks to him I got out. He gave me the idea to, you know, that I said...
\par EM:\tab No, no, I mean, here the woman that gave you the S.S. food. That was in...
\par MF:\tab That was in Schlieben.\tab 
\par EM:\tab Yeah, but...
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab That was a Jewish girl or...
\par MF:\tab No, they were Poles. They were in separate barracks.
\par EM:\tab Oh, they were in separate barracks.
\par MF:\tab In separate, we never saw them. But we just had contact during, in the kitchen. Like...
\par EM:\tab Do you know if the sabotage was done by Jews or by Poles?
\par MF:\tab There were no Poles there. It had to be by Jews.
\par EM:\tab Because you said, oh.
\par MF:\tab There were only Polish women there who worked in the kitchen. They went to a different part. We never saw them again.
\par EM:\tab Oh.
\par MF:\tab In the camp where we were were only Jews and a few Germans. Our }{\i\f0 Lager\-\'e4l\-tes\-ter}{\f0 , that means the leader of our }{\i\f0 Lager}{\f0 , was a German Democrat. He was a German, who was in camp as a prisoner, like we were.
\par EM:\tab Now, so that means that the sabotage was done by the Jews.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, right.
\par EM:\tab O.K. Because that\rquote s important that we have...
\par MF:\tab Right. Anyway, so they sent in young S.S., 18-, 19-year-old boys, grew up un
der Hitler, and they were killers. Every time somebody came from work, you saw white bandaged heads. They were beating you like hell, you know, to rebuild everything fast. Then they took me away from that work and they put me to a }{\i\f0 Kommando}{\f0

t want it there, for what reason we don\rquote t know. We had to push that to a forest, to a...railroad tracks and put them on the flatbeds there. So we were eight people with  }{\i\f0 Brechstangen}{\f0 . [crowbars] I don\rquote 
t know the names in English, you know? With some iron bars...
\par EM:\tab Bars, right.
\par MF:\tab To push it like this on wheels. And that\rquote s how we got it. So I\rquote m working there one day and comes, it was Christmas, \lquote 44. One of our foremen, Lupeg was his name, comes to me. And he says, \ldblquote 
Where the hell are you? We were looking for, we thought you ran away! I\rquote m looking for you half a day already!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote What\rquote s the big deal?\rdblquote  \ldblquote They brought a piano from a farmer and our boys...
\rdblquote  They emptied one of the holes where the last operation of the bazookas was on table, because they put four bazookas in a container. And the German girls put incendiaries, make sure there\rquote 
s no sabotage, and they closed it. So that that was on tables. So they took the tables out and our men are building a little stage. And they brought a piano from a, }{\i\f0 Bauer}{\f0 , from a farmer. \ldblquote And I told the chief o
f the camp that we have a concert pianist here.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Are you crazy? They\rquote re gonna kill me! They don\rquote t want people with education! What\rquote d you do?\rdblquote  I yelled at him. He said, \ldblquote Don\rquote

\par EM:\tab And that was a German...
\par MF:\tab Yeah, sure! He was...
\par EM:\tab [unclear].
\par MF:\tab The leader of the camp but he was in civilian clothes. So I come in, he had a }{\i\f0 Hakenkreuz}{\f0  [swastika] here on the lapel. So I come in and stand on attention...and he looks at me and says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Spielst du}{\b\i\f0  }{
\i\f0 Klavier}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  [Do you play piano?]
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab I already spoke some German.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab I picked it up because... \ldblquote Do you play the piano?\rdblquote  So I said, \ldblquote I used to play. But look at my hands, look at the calluses.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Yah, yah, sure.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote O.K
., where did you study?\rdblquote  Oh, I don\rquote t know what Lopeg told him and I\rquote m afraid to lie. So they\rquote re gonna kill me anyway, the hell with you. I said, \ldblquote Yeah, I graduated at Conservatory }{\i\f0 summa cum laude}{\f0

Would you like to play it?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Of course.\rdblquote  What we gonna do? It can only help, I figured. I went up to the stage, I looked at the piano and almost fainted. A bea
ten up jalopy from a, you know, just [unclear],  I mean from a...
\par EM:\tab Farmer? From...
\par MF:\tab Yeah, from a farmer, with one pedal. You can\rquote t imagine what it was. But the slow mov-, and then I, the slow movement, the first movement is slow. So I played it and h
e saw that I knew it. So he stopped me after I finished the first movement and he says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Spielst Du die Zweite}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Rhapsodie }{\f0 from Liszt?\rdblquote  [Will you play }{\i\f0 The Second Rhapsody}{\f0 
 from Liszt?) So I said, \ldblquote Now I have a sadist in front of me.\rdblquote  With}{\b\f0  }{\f0 what technique could anybody play}{\i\f0  The Second? }{\f0 
 But the beginning of it is slow. If you know the beginning of it. It goes, [hums the music]. And so on. It takes a short while, but while I was playing there was another German came up to this guy, and they walked away. So I didn\rquote 
t have to play the fast part. I was safe. I went back to my work. But there were rumors going around that those guys, those eight, we looked a little better than the others. Why? B}{\f0 e}{\f0 
cause some of the machinery was not in the factory grounds yet. They were dispersed among different farmers in the }{\i\f0 stodotach}{\f0 . How do you, }{\i\f0 stodota}{\f0  in...}{\i\f0 
\par }{\f0 EM:\tab Barrack?
\par MF:\tab No, it\rquote s not a barrack. A, on a, you know, where they keep their hay and all that?
\par EM:\tab Yeah, I know. I know.
\par MF:\tab }{\i\f0 Stodota}{\f0 . O.K. [tape off then on] Piano, coming from a barn or something. It was a little piece of, a real piece of junk. Anyway, but we used to get, some of the m}{\f0 a}{\f0 chinery was still in barns. They didn\rquote 
t bring them yet into the camp so we had to go there and get them. So we made a 50-50 with the }{\i\f0 Magazinier}{\f0 . [warehouseman] We wore two or three shirts, and the farmers were buying them from us, was giving us, they were gi}{\f0 v}{\f0 
ing us extra food. So we looked a little better because we had some extra food to eat. So the guys in the camp said, \ldblquote Oh, these two, they\rquote re gonna put them to }{\i\f0 trote}{\f0 .\rdblquote 
 They were big containers, because a bazooka has a head. And a head, you know, a head which penetrates the tank when it\rquote s being shot, [unclear]. So in the head is }{\i\f0 tretil}{\f0 . That\rquote s a chemical, a yel
low chemical. And they were boiling it in tremendously big containers like two, three thousand liters or maybe more. I don\rquote t know. You had to go up on a la}{\f0 d}{\f0 
der, walk around it and it was, and the fumes were coming out of it. Germans worked there with gas masks. They worked a day, had two 
days off or something, special food. Us they put there where we were. If you survived two, three weeks, you drop dead, they took other guys. So we were afraid they\rquote re gonna take us to that work because you know, we looked a little bet
ter. And so, and this was gonna finish. We\rquote ll take all the machinery out, and then what? So one lunch, after a lunch break one of our guys comes out in a whirr, he says, \ldblquote Hey! I got a new job!\rdblquote 
 Because he was worried. He was smart, and he went to the fire department and says, \ldblquote I became a fireman. After I\rquote m finished here I\rquote ll be a fireman.\rdblquote  So I said, \ldblquote He got something. I\rquote 
m gonna try, too, because that\rquote s the end.\rdblquote  So one lunch break I\rquote m walking through the grounds of the factory, tremendous grounds, and I see my, the chief, who I played the piano for. He\rquote s going this way and I\rquote 
m going, you know...
\par EM:\tab Yeah, in\'85
\par MF:\tab In the, toward his direction. And I said, \ldblquote Now or never.\rdblquote  And I got up to him and I stood at attention. I, my luck was that I spoke German already. And I said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Herr Ch
ef, erinnern Sie sich, ich habe Ihnen Klavier vorgespielt vor zwei Wochen?}{\f0 \rdblquote  You know, \ldblquote I played it for you, the piano, two weeks ago?\rdblquote  \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Ja, ja, was willst Du denn}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  \ldblquote 
Yeah, what do you want?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Should I survive the war, I would like to play the p}{\f0 i}{\f0 ano. I have no other reason to live. My family is already murdered. Could you find me a job where I can save my hands?\rdblquote 
 And I looked him straight in the eye. So he thought for a moment and he says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Wer ist Dein Meister}{\f0 ?\rdblquote   \ldblquote Who is your chief?\rdblquote  So I told him it was a guy from Leipzig, he was a chemist. \ldblquote 
Tell him to come in my office.\rdblquote  So I ran to the barrack and I told him. So he went over. He was there for a while. He came back and said, \ldblquote Now you go to the office.\rdblquote  Oh yeah, later I found out he asked him, you 
know, if I speak German or how I work. He couldn\rquote t say anything bad. He tried me out once, b}{\f0 e}{\f0 cause we organized the cigarettes. So the eight of us would take, everybody would take a puff and it\rquote 
ll go around. So one day I had to go with him to pick...
\par EM:\tab Who was that that was the Commander that time?
\par MF:\tab That Leip-, that, no, that guy...
\par EM:\tab [unclear]
\par MF:\tab Who, my direct boss, the chemist from Leipzig?
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab So he saw us smoking this one cigarette. So we\rquote re going, it was to do some work, whatever it was. He takes out a pack of cigarettes, lights one up, took one puff and throw it, threw it right in my trajectory. He figured I\rquote 
ll pick it up. So I walk, comes the time when the cigarette there and I stepped on it and I just put it out with my foot. So he looks at me and says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Rauchst Du nicht}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  [You don\rquote t smoke?] I said, \ldblquote 
The crap which you\rquote re throwing away, I don\rquote t.\rdblquote  I says, \ldblquote You can force me to work. I\rquote m working.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab \ldblquote But this is, I\rquote m not gonna do it. I have my }{\i\f0 Stolz}{\f0 .\rdblquote  I, you know, I have my pride.\rdblquote  Next day he offered me a cigarette from the pack. Believe that? So I went back to this chief, and he said, 
\ldblquote You go to the proving grounds, }{\i\f0 Strzelnica}{\f0 , [shooting range] to the,\rdblquote  you  know, they were shooting all kinds of ammunition. They\rquote re trying out the b}{\f0 a}{\f0 zookas, whatever it was. \ldblquote 
You report to the chief. His name is Mr. Steller. He has a job for you.\rdblquote  So I go over there and I shake. I don\rquote t know who the guy is. Is he a Nazi? He can kill. He could do a
nything he wants with me. I go into the barrack and he shakes hands with me! He says he is an anti-Nazi! I just won my life. And there\rquote 
s a girl, a young, pretty girl, German girl sitting at the typewriter. So I look at him, I look at her, and says, \ldblquote Is he crazy?\rdblquote  You know, they\rquote re denouncing each other all the time. He said, \ldblquote Don\rquote 
t worry. She thinks the way I do. What can I do for you?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote God! I don\rquote t believe it!\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab And he was the chief of the...
\par MF:\tab Of the proving grounds!
\par EM:\tab Of the proving grounds.
\par MF:\tab }{\i\f0 Strzelnica}{\f0 . He was in civilian clothes, by the way.
\par EM:\tab Yeah?
\par MF:\tab He was not in, he was just a, later on it turned out he was a garage mechanic.
\par EM:\tab Oh!
\par MF:\tab I found him after the war. A good looking fellow. So he said, first he asked me to sit down, on the chair. So I sat on the chair, after two years I sat on the floor. So I almost cried. And he said, \ldblquote What can I do for you?\rdblquote 
 So I thought fast. I said, \ldblquote I was working at the kitchen and I knew some girls there. Well if I could get to that, I\rquote ll get some extra food, and food means life. Could I...maybe, \lquote 
cause there is another group on the east side of that proving grounds and they have ten people there. So, and we get to the gate and there\rquote s this S.S. man, a sergeant, a }{\i\f0 Raportf\'fchrer}{\f0 . So he\rquote ll attach me to the tenth. I
\rquote ll be the eleventh. And the foreman will give me a little bit of soup and that\rquote ll be the end of it. Could I go myself to pick it up?\rdblquote  And he said, \ldblquote Let\rquote s go. Let\rquote s find out. We\rquote ll go to the gate.
\rdblquote  When the gate, you know, where the barracks, and there was a gate, and there was a factory. And he says, \ldblquote So I\rquote m going to insult you on the way. Laugh it off. I have to for the other Nazis around here. I\rquote 
m gonna call you names. Don\rquote t worry about it.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Verfluchter Jude}{\f0 , [cursed Jew]\rdblquote  blah, blah, and all this. And I said, \ldblquote Kiss my foot.\rdblquote 
 And we got to the gate, and there was one of ours, Schreiber, who was helping the S.S. man to keep track of all the movements of hundreds of people going in and out. He had a arm band here saying \ldblquote Schreiber\rdblquote 
. I knew him. And so he came in and Steller says to him, \ldblquote Yeah, they sent me this guy here. He is gonna work for us. \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Wie ist das mit der Fresserei}{\f0 ? How is it with the food.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh,\rdblquote  he said, 
\ldblquote there are ten people there. He\rquote ll be eleven, all set.\rdblquote  So Steller says, \ldblquote It can\rquote t be.\rdblquote  And Steller is a civilian. So he, the sergeant looks at him. He said, \ldblquote 
Who the hell are you to tell me what can be and can not be?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Wait a minute. Not so fast. He\rquote s gonna work us, for the Germans. He is gonna sit in the bu
nker and do some work which we are doing for us. And we are making lunch once at twelve, once at three, once at eleven, once we don\rquote 
t make lunch at all if we have a lot of work. Now you want a Jewish prisoner to force us to have lunch when he is eating? Are you crazy?\rdblquote  Like this. And I winked at our guy, the Schreiber. I said, \ldblquote Come on, say something.\rdblquote 
 So he says, \ldblquote So, what do you mean? What do you want me to do? Make a }{\i\f0 Kommando}{\f0  of one person?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote I don\rquote t give a damn.\rdblquote  So I said to Schreiber [mumblin
g]. So he says, [German]. He says, [German]. He says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Kommando von einer Person, gibt es so was.}{\f0 \rdblquote   [Well a }{\i\f0 Kommando}{\f0  of one person? Is there such a thing?] O.K., so he made me a }{\i\f0 Kommando}{\f0 
 of one. And I was going alone to work. There were 400 people in a group. Well when I got, in the morning I got up later. I didn\rquote 
t have to stand for a half hour and wait till they counted 400 people. And I got right to the window where the two S.S. men were standing, and they were making fun of me. They said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 
Bei dem stimmt immer die Vorderrichtung und die Seitenrichtung.}{\f0 \rdblquote  In other words, \ldblquote Nobody is missing. The row is always even this way and that way!\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Get the hell out of here!\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab So what were you, what kind of work were you doing there?
\par MF:\tab So I was sitting in a bunker. There was a German, young 18-year-old Gestapo agent sitting there. He didn\rquote 
t want to sit in the bunker. So I had to go underground. That was the edge of the proving grounds there. And I had to go out about maybe thirty m}{\f0 e}{\f0 ters, forty, I don\rquote 
t know, twenty, something like this. There was a little bunker and I had to push out a target. The target was a square like this, or a rectangle, with little wires in here. And there were some screws in here. And I have to push it up above ground.
 But those thirty meters behind me in a little barrack was sitting Walter, who was shooting single, two centimeter bullets I think, from a machine gun. And he had to sit at this, I mean, hit this target. Now, when he, he was supposed to, I\rquote 
m supposed to direct him. When I brought it back down, I saw where he broke it. So if he broke it too much to the right\emdash I had a phone\emdash the phone was only to this barrack, to the shooter, that\rquote 
s all. And I had a heater, electric heater. So I was set in the palace! Well, no S.S. man could see me. Nobody could beat me. I just won my life. So I called up. I said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Walter, schiessen Sie mehr nach rechts.}{\f0 \rdblquote 
 [Walter, shoot more to the right.] because he said there was too much here. Walter was...
\par EM:\tab And Walter was a German, right?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, a civilian.
\par EM:\tab Mmm hmm.
\par MF:\tab Now he w-...
\par EM:\tab Now how come they were in a proving ground and they were using civilians to do the shooting and the testing?
\par MF:\tab I have no idea. He was in civilian clothes. He had a }{\i\f0 Hakenkreuz}{\f0  [swastika] here, but he was, so we don\rquote t, well the chief of the factory was also in civilian clothes, maybe he was an S.S. man, I don\rquote t know.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab Anyway, so when Walter wasn\rquote t shooting I could take a nap. And nobody can catch me. Now, Steller would come in. He asked me what I was doing, so I told him. So he said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Diese}{\f0  }{\i\f0 Schweine}{\f0 ,\rdblquote 
 [these pigs]. \ldblquote What did they do to you?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote What is the world gonna say when we lose the war?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I hope so. I hope you lose it.\rdblquote  They already probably knew they\rquote 
re losing it. An
yway, so Steller would come in. I heard his steps. See, the only one who could come in there, and he had a beautiful leather coat, opens up his coat, and takes out a three-pound military bread, takes out a pocket knife, cuts it in half. He says, 
\ldblquote Half for you, half for me.\rdblquote  He was like a brother. He was an anti-Nazi. And it was just like a dream. So, that\rquote s the way, then he brought me coupons for cigarettes, for good work. See, you can get a pack of cigarettes for I don
\rquote t know how many coupons. So, I didn\rquote t
 smoke. So, I kept the cigarettes. And I had cigarettes when there were no cigarettes in camp. And the S.S. were buying it from us! They were giving us extra bread! And I could keep the bread in that little bunker. Where my brother worked in other bunkers
, were thousands of tons of ammunition. If the German wants a good math}{\b\f0 -}{\f0 , my brother was. So he was running the show there. So he also got some\-times something, some extra piece of bread.
\par EM:\tab But he was what? I didn\rquote t get it. There was...
\par MF:\tab There were ammunition storages, big storages of ammunition.
\par EM:\tab So...
\par MF:\tab Somebody had to keep track of it, mathematically. So my brother was doing that.
\par EM:\tab Oh.
\par MF:\tab And he came down, also we were stealing }{\i\f0 Zuckerr\'fcben}{\f0 , that means the...
\par EM:\tab The sugar?
\par MF:\tab The sugar, no, sugar...how do you say }{\i\f0 buraki}{\f0 ? [sugar beets]
\par EM:\tab What? [tape off then on]
\par MF:\tab There was, all the guys were stealing sugar beets on the railroad station. So we exchanged with them for cigarettes and we could, or some other stuff. And it had to be cooked. And you\rquote 
re not allowed to cook on a stove in the barrack. But Walter had a stove, and so he cooked for, he was my cook. He was cooking for me! And so my brother came down and had lunch together. Anyway, it was just fantastic. I didn\rquote t know wha
t I was doing because I knew when he broke that little wire, some kind of a thing fell down in the office. And I think they figured out the speed of the bullet or something. They wouldn\rquote t tell me. I don\rquote 
t know. They were two centimeter anti-aircraft...bullets. I think that\rquote s what it was. So, I kept all whatever I had, some extra bread or cigarettes I kept that in...my place of work. Because if I kept it on my pillow in my barrack, they\rquote 
ll steal it. That\rquote s obvious. People were hungry. And that was going on t
ill, must have been, oh yeah, one day, before they took us away from Schlieben. The guard...knew me because that was the end of the proving grounds, so the S.S. guard was walking back and forth there. So one day he calls me and says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 
Du komm mal her, hab keine Angst}{\f0 .\rdblquote  \ldblquote Don\rquote t worry,\rdblquote  he says. \ldblquote Come, I want to talk to you.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote To me?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Yeah, yeah, don\rquote 
t worry. Come on. The war is over,\rdblquote  he says. \ldblquote Germany lost the war.\rdblquote  Listen! An S.S. man talks to me. And now he says, \ldblquote Yeah, I see you\rquote re a smart fellow.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote 
Get another ten guys. We\rquote ll walk out of here. We\rquote re at the end of it anyway here. I\rquote ll escort you to the Amer}{\f0 i}{\f0 cans. I\rquote ll save your life. And then you\rquote ll tell the Americans that I saved your life and you
\rquote ll save mine. It\rquote s a deal?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Of course!\rdblquote  What am I supposed to say, no? He\rquote d shoot me. I avoided him like the pest, never saw him again. And when I saw him he says, \ldblquote Come here.
\rdblquote  I went the other way around and [unclear]. And then one day they made a roll call and right straight to the trains. Then I had some extra bread there. I had cig}{\f0 a}{\f0 
rettes. It was all, [unclear]. I left them. And they took us away, because the front was ge}{\f0 t}{\f0 ting near, I guess. So they took us to Bautzen. We were there maybe a day.
\par EM:\tab Baltsen?
\par MF:\tab Bautzen. B-A-U-T-Z-E-N. That was a factory of...railroad cars or something, or street cars or railroad cars. We were there maybe a day and they took us now on the }{\i\f0 Todesmarsch}{\f0 , that march, that death march.
\par EM:\tab Death march.
\par MF:\tab For about twenty hours walking, two hours resting there, sitting somewhere, whatever. And we were walking. And a colleague of mine, he was with me, yeah, and they had a horse and a buggy behind the group. We were maybe 200 people. I\rquote 
m dry, I need something to drink.
\par EM:\tab Some water?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, thank you.
\par EM:\tab [unclear], would you like [tape off then on]
\par MF:\tab So wait a minute, where am I now?
\par EM:\tab You\rquote re...
\par MF:\tab Oh yeah, so...
\par EM:\tab You were on }{\i\f0 Todesmarsch}{\f0 .
\par MF:\tab Yeah, so from Bautzen we had to walk. So they had a horse and buggy behind and who had trouble with his feet or something he said, \ldblquote Now just sit on the horse...\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab On the buggy?
\par MF:\tab \ldblquote On the buggy there, and they\rquote ll take you.\rdblquote  That was a nice little thing. So a fellow, and so they, when the buggy was full, the horse and buggy was full, they took it up, up a 
little hill. There were hills there. And we heard shooting.
\par EM:\tab And they shot everybody.
\par MF:\tab They were killing those people! And all of a sudden, we are walking and a, one fellow comes, way out of breath, stands next to me, in my row. \ldblquote I just escaped out!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote What happened?\rdblquote  He said, 
\ldblquote They were shooting us! But I saw they were repeating the guns, so I started to run down the hill, zigzagging. They were shooting after me, but they didn\rquote t get me.\rdblquote  So he\rquote s coming back and he\rquote 
s standing next to me. And the Captain, the leader of our group, the S.S. man, is standing and waiting and looking who escaped. So I said, \ldblquote Oh God, now he\rquote ll mistake me for you and I\rquote ll get out, and I\rquote ll be shot.\rdblquote 
 And he noticed him. He says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Kannst du laufen}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  [Can you walk?] He had something in his shoe was rubbing against his leg or something. So he figured, \ldblquote Why should I walk? I can ride a,\rdblquote 
 but he was O.K. So he looks at him [unclear] and says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Kannst du laufen}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Ya, everything O.K. I can walk. Nothing happened.\rdblquote  He let him go. And we came to...Nicksdorf, in Czech-...

So when we got to Nicksdorf, we were a group maybe of 150 people, 200, just about this. And then these were private barracks where they kept French civilians which they brought from France to work there. And they were gone already. So there was no fence, 
nothing. It was just a civilian camp. So the camp was guarded by the S.S. There were plenty of them, you know, standing almost every, next to every door, every wi}{\f0 n}{\f0 
dow. They kept good eyes on us. And they took us to work and they, we were outside there some\-where. And we had to dig ditches. And they said we\rquote re digging ditches against the American tanks. It turned out it wasn\rquote 
t against the American tanks, but the Polish Army came from Russia, from the east. And the mayor of that little town whoever it was, gave us \ldblquote in appreciation\rdblquote , in parentheses, gave us a little }{\i\f0 Mehlsuppe}{\f0 
 it was called, some }{\i\f0 Suppe Mehl }{\f0 or flour, whatever it was. But the soup was so horrible that everybody was running to the latrine all night. And I\rquote m still running ever since. That\rquote s those years. I don\rquote 
t know what the devil it was. Anyway, when we first started to run at night, and ev}{\f0 e}{\f0 rybody wanted to go across to the latrine, the S.S. put the guns on us. They said we\rquote re creating a revolution. So we said, \ldblquote If you won\rquote 
t let us go to the latrine, the barracks will swim away.\rdblquote  They finally realized what we wanted and they let us go. So we were di}{\f0 g}{\f0 
ging there, and over there, the last day of the war already. And then all of a sudden one day we see a little ten-year-old, about ten-year-old German boy
 walks around there. And there was only one may-, one guard, I think it was there. We were now 200 in a group of us where there could have been twenty or something. So one guard was there, another place there was another guard and so on. So this German li
ttle boy walked around, and he had a coat. And inside the coat he was showing me, I saw it...he just came up to me and showed me a paper, a newspaper. He wants to give me a newspaper. So I figured it\rquote 
s some provocation or some...I was afraid. And there were cut woods there, you know, big trees were lying on the ground. So I said, \ldblquote When the guard goes away, put it between the trees and get lost.\rdblquote 
 So he did and then when the guard didn\rquote t see I took it out, put it under my coat, and we got back to the barracks. Guess what it was? It was May 1st, 1945, big headline, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Berlin}{\f0  }{\i\f0 Gefallen}{\f0 .\rdblquote 
 Berlin was taken. Oh God! So we don\rquote t understand why would a boy show us this. Well, we found him after liberation and we asked him. He said his father was killed by the Nazis in a 
concentration camp. He was German. So he wanted to give us some hope, that little boy, so he brought us that paper. He}{\b\f0  }{\f0 was, so}{\b\f0  }{\f0 he}{\b\f0  }{\f0 became}{\b\f0  }{\f0 our}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
mascot. Anyway, so, but how we were liberated, and so that was going on every day. And it was just a few days. Then
 one night, it must have been about four in the morning, day break started just coming. And I go over to the latrine and I think, I see different faces. I, you couldn\rquote 
t stand up and look in his face, but I saw they were old men, with guns. So I come back and I was sleeping on a floor with my brother, under a table, so there was protection from the table or something. And I said, \ldblquote 
You look here. I think the S.S. is gone. Looks like old guys are there.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Shh, let me go take a look. Well, let\rquote s be careful about it, because some guys, they\rquote 
ll find out that this, they might start jumping for joy or something, could be the }{\i\f0 Volkssturm}{\f0  [military reserve units] and they might get scared and kill us.\rdblquote  So he went in there and he...came back. He said, \ldblquote That\rquote 
s }{\i\f0 Volkssturm}{\f0 . That\rquote s it.\rdblquote  So it was quiet. We just \ldblquote shushed,\rdblquote  like this, and then, you know, about seven or so, they opened the windows. And they\rquote re there and they smile, they were}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
old}{\b\f0  }{\f0 guys. They said, \ldblquote Oh, you\rquote re gonna be free! You\rquote re gonna live!\rdblquote  Oh, then wait a m}{\f0 i}{\f0 
nute. I forgot. Before this happened, the chief of S.S., or the Gestapo, came to our camp just a few days before and they said, he promised us solemnly we will all be killed. He said in German, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Ihr wird alle erschossen}{\f0 .\rdblquote 
 [You will all be shot.] Quite a story about this guy later on. So then they got lost. Only the }{\i\f0 Volksst\'fcrmer}{\f0  came in and so on as I told you. Then maybe an hour later the }{\i\f0 Volksst\'fcrmer}{\f0 
 evaporated and there was nobody there. So, among us were a couple of Germans who were prisoners\emdash Social Democrats. So our }{\i\f0 Lager\'e4ltester}{\f0 , the leader of our camp, was a German, Mr. Zeider. I have his signature. So he\rquote s...

\par }\pard \qj\fi540\li720\sl400\slmult0\nowidctlpar\tx1800\tx5760\tx6210\adjustright {\f0 EM:\tab What was his name? Could you spell it?
\par MF:\tab Zei-, I think, [tape off then on] Yeah, so among us were a few Germans who were Social Democrats. And our }{\i\f0 Lager\'e4ltester}{\f0 , that means the leader of our group, was a German Social Democrat. His name was Zeidler. So he says, 
\ldblquote Let\rquote s do a roll call to see if anybody is missing.\rdblquote  So we did a roll call, and one was missing. I look around, my brother is missing! Then we looked, it was a little hilly up there in the Sudetenland. And I see my brother com
ing toward us on a bicycle. He was already in town and he just kicked a German, something, and took a bike from him. He came down and said, \ldblquote What are you doing here doing the roll call? We are free! The Polish Army is on Main Street!\rdblquote 
 So we yelled, \ldblquote Hurrah;\rdblquote  and we came out there and that\rquote s what it was. So I became friendly with the lie
utenant who was from Lemberg, about my size, my age at that time. And we went out. They put Germans in that camp and we knocked on doors and asked for a room.
\par EM:\tab That was the Polish Army that was fighting with the Russians, right?
\par MF:\tab Yeah. No, but...
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab They were a separate unit. There were not Russians between them.
\par EM:\tab Uh huh. But they...
\par MF:\tab They were just Poles.
\par EM:\tab Poles, O.K.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, they came from Russia. Anyway, so we knocked on doors and the Germans first were afraid. Then they begged us to come in. Why? Because we put a sign on the door saying in Polish, \ldblquote Former Prisoners of War Here. Please Don\rquote 
t Disturb.\rdblquote  B}{\f0 e}{\f0 cause someplace else they didn\rquote t see the sign, they\rquote d go in, kick the door in and let the Germans have it. They paid them back
 a little bit. As a matter of fact, I was together with my brother. There was a widow in that little house. So the Germans came from across the street and they said, \ldblquote You\rquote re uncomfortable. Why don\rquote t one of you come stay with us?
\rdblquote  So we said, \ldblquote Get the hell out of here.\rdblquote  You know what they wanted? They wanted a little sign on the door. So one day I\rquote m sitting there, we\rquote 
re eating. She cooked for us. She was a very fine old woman. And she told us that they were afraid because she, they talked with the S.S. Says, \ldblquote Looks like that\rquote s the end of the war. They\rquote ll be liberated. They\rquote ll kill us.
\rdblquote  Well, they understood. Normally they, we should have killed them for what they did to us. So the S.S. told her, \ldblquote Don\rquote t worry about it. They\rquote ll be finished tonight.\rdblquote  They had se
t up the machine guns. About two in the morning we were supposed to be all shot. But there was a breakthrough in the front. And that\rquote s how they had to run about, ten, eleven o\rquote clock at night. And that\rquote 
s why they ran away. So, this Tadek was his name, he was from Lemberg. And he didn\rquote t know any German and I did. So he was the leader of that camp and the guardhouse. So he said, \ldblquote You will be my interpreter.\rdblquote 
 And so, fine. And so one day we\rquote re eating the soup, about one o\rquote clock or so. And a sergeant comes on a bike and he says, he was all out of breath and says, \ldblquote Come on! Come on! Tadek is waiting for you!\rdblquote  I said, 
\ldblquote What happened?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote We caught the Chief of the Gestapo.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote What? How\rquote d you get him?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote I don\rquote t know. Talk to him.\rdblquote  So I almost 
choked on my soup, pushed myself away from the table, and around we go to the guardhouse. Here he is! Now he ain\rquote t so splendid, doesn\rquote t look so tough, and not so big anymore. He\rquote 
s in civilian clothes, scared stiff, sitting on a chair. He must have been ten feet tall or something. When he was sitting on the chair, and that lieutenant was sitting on the table with a whip in his hand, he was taller than the lieutenant. That\rquote 
s how big he was. I said, \ldblquote How did you get him?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh,\rdblquote  he says, \ldblquote Germans came in here, and they said, they\rquote re}{\b\f0  }{\f0 great denunciators, and they said, \ldblquote You\rquote 
re picking a little fish? Why don\rquote t you pick on a big one?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Yeah? Like who?\rdblquote  They said, \ldblquote Like the Chief of Gestapo of Sud}{\f0 e}{\f0 tenland.\rdblquote  \ldblquote 
Well do you know his address? Do you know where he lives?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Sure!\rdblquote  They gave him the address, so he sent out a couple of jeeps, whatever, with soldiers. They got him and they brought him, and here he\rquote 
s sitting, shaking scared stiff. So Tadek says to me, \ldblquote O.K., go ahead ask him all the names of Gestapo and S.S., I want, and the a}{\f0 d}{\f0 dresses.\rdblquote  So I did. But he couldn\rquote 
t talk. He was cringing, he was sitting scared. So I said to him, \ldblquote Don\rquote t you see? He\rquote s cold. We gotta warm him up. So we went to work on him.\rdblquote  And we started to beat the hell out of him. And I said to him, \ldblquote 
How do you like your own medicine? That\rquote s the way you were beating us and now you\rquote re getting a little back of it. Do you like it? Do you find it...\rdblquote  A sergeant came with a...no, a }{\i\f0 K\'fcbel}{\f0 ...
\par EM:\tab A bucket? A bucket.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, a bucket of water, threw water on him, brought him back to, beat more of him. Finally when he started to talk, he was such a coward. And I couldn\rquote t write so fast the way he talked. So I said, \ldblquote Shut up!\rdblquote  I said, 
\ldblquote You talk too fast! I can\rquote t write that fast!\rdblquote  Finally we pumped everything out of him, we took him outside, and he was only falling on his knees, holding his hands to a prayer that, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Lassen}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 
sie mich}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 doch}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 bitte}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 leben}{\f0 . Please let me live.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote You pig! You want to live? Why were you born? How many people did you murder? You want to live? You are kidding!
\rdblquote  So Tadek gives me his m}{\f0 a}{\f0 chine gun, or gun, whatever it was, no I think it was a little machine gun, something. He said, \ldblquote Go ahead.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I can\rquote t do it. I\rquote m not a murderer.\rdblquote 
 He said, \ldblquote You\rquote re a coward?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote No, no, no. Slow down. I\rquote m not a coward. But I cannot kill anybody in cold blood. Let him jump at me. In self defense I will, but otherwise I can\rquote t do it. I\rquote 
m not a Nazi.\rdblquote  And he stood there yelling. I said, \ldblquote Shut up you pig!\rdblquote  And so the, a soldier was, the sergeant with us, and he killed him. And that was the end of one Nazi, you know?
\par EM:\tab So that was a Polish sergeant that killed him?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, sure.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab Then I was looking for a piano. I wanted to start playing the piano. So we went to the Mayor or somebody. They gave me a key to a palace what was, a big Nazi lived there, and he, of course, he ran away. And there was a concert grand, a beautiful p
}{\f0 i}{\f0 ano in there. Oh yeah, before I went there, I gotta tell you. I forgot. I took a friend of mine and I said, \ldblquote I had a cut finger.\rdblquote 
 This finger, it was cut in camp. I was sitting on a [unclear] the finger right in the knife. And it healed up, thank God. So, I said, \ldblquote I want to find out if I\rquote ll be able to play.\rdblquote  I knew it I will on a table it didn\rquote 
t hurt. But I wanted to try a piano. So I said, \ldblquote Let\rquote s go to a nice neighborhood. Maybe somebody has a piano there and I\rquote ll try.\rdblquote  So we went, we knocked on the door. The Germans opened up, scared stiff. We said, 
\ldblquote Don\rquote t be afraid. We\rquote re not murderers. We\rquote re not Nazis. You were Nazis. We\rquote re not. I see you have a piano there.\rdblquote  There was a long hallway. I saw an upright p}{\f0 i}{\f0 ano. I said, \ldblquote I\rquote 
m a concert pianist. I\rquote m no murderer.\rdblquote  I was not a murderer. I said, \ldblquote I had an injured finger. I want to see if I\rquote ll be able to play.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Well, come on in. Come on in.\rdblquote 
 So I went in, opened that piano and I tried. I said, \ldblquote Oh yeah, thank God. Thank God, I\rquote ll play.\rdblquote  So he says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Bleiben Sie doch hier, spielen Sie was}{\f0 .\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote 
Stay here, play something.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Get lost.\rdblquote  And we walked out. Then I got this key to this palace. And there was a concert B\'f6sendorfer, a beautiful piano. And I started to play. And I played five minutes and I couldn
\rquote t move my arms. It hurt. It was murder. I was doing physical work and this...finger, it was the fine mu

\par EM:\tab Now where was all that?

s Mikulasovice now in Czech. So, across, on the same street, across another house, a colleague of mine lived there and we used to see each other and talk. And there were two German wome

\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab All right.
\par EM:\tab All right.
\par MF:\tab And so, I asked my bro-, they say they\rquote ll give me something, you know, a coat or this or that, whatever, a watch. Oh, they\rquote ll give me a watch for me and for my brother. Who had a watch? We had nothing. So I asked my brother, 
\ldblquote What do you think? What should I do?\rdblquote  Oh yeah, they\rquote ll give me a bicycle, so I won\rquote t have to walk. All right. And they\rquote ll walk with that little pushcart, and they\rquote ll put their stuff on it. I said, 
\ldblquote What should I do? Do you think I should go?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Go ahead. You want to go? Go. Nothing\rquote s gonna happen.\rdblquote  So I went, and we 
just came out of Nick-, and they put their stuff on that little pushcart and they were going in front and I was riding slowly in the back. We came out about a couple of kilo
meters outside of that little town. And there comes, out of the forest comes the Polish guard out with a gun and says, \ldblquote What the hell? What are you doing here?\rdblquote 
 So I said in Polish to him, you know I just talked him out of it, and he let us go. So we went on, and they got scared. And they saw that, what I talked to him it worked. So they stopped. And they say they want to take those two little sui}{\f0 t}{\f0 
cases, put it on my bicycle, on the back they had the little, you know, space for luggage with the little spring and all that. So they did it. I could hardly ride when I got over. That must have been maybe forty, fifty pounds. I don\rquote t remem

\par EM:\tab And you went back...
\par MF:\tab I went back.
\par EM:\tab To Nicksdorf.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. Then we took off after a while and we decided to go to Prague. Well, the trains were free, everything. We could go on a train. So we came to Prague and the Czech governme
nt was wonderful to us. They were liberated themselves, so they gave us a hotel where to stay in center city. It was an empty hotel. They cleared it up. I don\rquote 
t know who was there before. I found out later. That was pretty funny, too. It was a whore house there in the war for German soldiers.
\par EM:\tab Oh.
\par MF:\tab And they cleaned it up. I\rquote ll tell you how I found out. You\rquote ll laugh. Anyway, so, and they gave us }{\i\f0 listki}{\f0 , those little stamps so we could ride the streetcars for free and go in a restaurant and pay with tho

\par EM:\tab When you say, \ldblquote we,\rdblquote  is it you and your brother?
\par MF:\tab No, it was...
\par EM:\tab Or was there a whole group?
\par MF:\tab All of us who came there, you know, refugees. And one day I went for a walk with a friend of mine from camp. He was an engineer. And we walked down the street and we see a beautiful building. And it says the }{\i\f0 Czeska}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 
Philharmonia}{\f0 , Czech Philha}{\f0 r}{\f0 monic. I said, \ldblquote Hey! A concert hall! Let\rquote s go take a look!\rdblquote  I didn\rquote t see one for so many years. So there\rquote s a doorman in there in a uniform, a big tall guy. So I said, 
\ldblquote Could we go in? We were just liberated.\rdblquote  They were very nice to us. \ldblquote Could we, I\rquote m a pianist,\rdblquote  I said. \ldblquote I didn\rquote 
t see a concert hall for five years. Could we go in and take a look how it looks?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh, you\rquote re lucky because the orchestra is having a rehearsal.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh yeah?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Who\rquote 
s conducting?\rdblquote  So he says, \ldblquote Kubelik.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Kubelik?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Kubelik is dead. He was a great violinist.\rdblquote   [Jan Kubelik, 1880-1940] \ldblquote That\rquote s right, but that\rquote 
s his son Rafael. He is a conductor.\rdblquote  And he was a pianist, too. So we walked in there, and sure enough they were rehearsing, they were playing. And we sat down quietly. They were playing that Dvorak }{\i\f0 Symphony from the New World}{\f0 
. And my pal after a while says to me, \ldblquote O.K., let\rquote s go.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote You go. I\rquote ll stay.\rdblquote  So he left. And after it was over I went back stage, intr}{\f0 o}{\f0 
duced myself to the conductor, to Kubelik and I told him who I was. \ldblquote I was just libe}{\f0 r}{\f0 ated.\rdblquote  Now I repeated a symphony in E Minor piano concerto. I said, \ldblquote Maybe I\rquote ll try and play}{\b\f0  }{\f0 for}{\b\f0  }{
\f0 him.\rdblquote  I just got a wild idea.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab So he says, \ldblquote Oh yeah, it\rquote d be,\rdblquote  I told him, he knew my teacher. Drzewiecki was known all over Europe. So he said, \ldblquote I\rquote 
ll tell you what, we, the pianos are now, you know, they are on the side, with...they are without legs. We, they, you know, we were just liberated ourselves. I\rquote m just organizing the orchestra. We didn\rquote t have a Philha}{\f0 r}{\f0 
monic. Why don\rquote t you come Saturday in my home to play for me there?\rdblquote  He gave me his address. \ldblquote Five o\rquote clock.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Fine.\rdblquote  So I went there Satur
day, and I found a place where to practice. I went to the Conservatory I think. I came in there. He wasn\rquote t home yet, his wife was there. She was very nice, and she said, \ldblquote 
My husband is having auditions for new members for the orchestra. Well, he called here, he said he\rquote ll be back soon. You can warm up now a little bit if you want to.\rdblquote 
 And there was a student of his, his name was Ilya Hurnick, who was studying with him composition. And then she also showed me the study of Variosof, Kubelik\rquote s father, and this
 music room. And there was hanging like this from a, you know, on a chair, you know, a glass enclosure. That was a Stradivarius. It was a beautiful instrument. So I practiced. He finally came and he was tall and he was, oh, he was a golden human being. I
\rquote m telling you, pure gold, that man. I love him. He took his coat off, he said, \ldblquote Well, I\rquote m sorry.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote You know, we were just liberated ourselves,\rdblquote 
 blah blah blah, all this. So I sat down and played. So I played an E Minor Concerto from memory. So he looks at me, he can\rquote t believe. He says, \ldblquote Wait a minute. When did you see the music? Where\rquote s your music?\rdblquote  \ldblquote 
Music? It burned in Warsaw, t}{\f0 o}{\f0 gether with my piano.\rdblquote  \ldblquote You mean you didn\rquote t see this music for five years?\rdblquote  \ldblquote That\rquote s right.\rdblquote  \ldblquote You didn\rquote t make one mistake!\rdblquote 
 \ldblquote Sorry,\rdblquote  I don\rquote t need to apologize, I apologized. So he says, \ldblquote That\rquote s unbelievable.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote You\rquote ll play with me.\rdblquote  \ldblquote 
Where do you live? Wait a minute! Where do you eat? What is it? I mean, what do you do with yourself? How do you exist?\rdblquote  So I told him, \ldblquote The city was so nice to us, gave us a hotel where we stay there.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote 
What\rquote s the name of the hotel?\rdblquote  I told him, and he started to laugh. I said, \ldblquote Mr. Kubelik, what is so funny?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote What\rquote s so funny? During the war that was a whorehouse for the German soldiers!
\rdblquote  So I said, \ldblquote When I get back there I\rquote ll look under my bed and one was left!\rdblquote 
 [both laugh] So, and then, one day, and we ate, there was a Jewish Committee there. And so we ate lunch there. So I think I went to practice some. When I came back around twelve or one, whatever it was, my brother wasn\rquote 
t there yet. So I talked with some friends, and you know, we just talked a little bit. And then a man comes up and kind of interrupts a little bit our conversation, about my age. You know, he just cu
t, butts in there, you know. And so I step back and I looked at him and I said, \ldblquote I know that guy.\rdblquote  And I scratch my head. I said, \ldblquote I know him. Who is he?\rdblquote  I [u}{\f0 n}{\f0 clear] it\rquote s my cousin, from Wyszk
\'f3w. They had a factory. I was there last time when I was ten years old, a good fifteen years ago. So I said, \ldblquote Wait a minute, is your name Y}{\f0 o}{\f0 skowicz?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Right.\rdblquote  \ldblquote From Wyszk\'f3w?
\rdblquote  \ldblquote Yeah.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Bicycle factory?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Right.\rdblquote  \ldblquote You don\rquote t recognize me?\rdblquote  So he looked, looked, looked and I fell inside his arms. We didn\rquote t see ea
ch other so many years. So he says, \ldblquote Well, I saw your brother yesterday.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I know. Julek will be here any minute.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Julek is alive?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Who the hell are you talking about?
\rdblquote  \ldblquote I was two days ago in Lodz. I saw Michael. He came back from Sib}{\f0 e}{\f0 ria.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Michael is alive! God!\rdblquote 
 So when Julek came in I told him this. The same night we were on a train, a freight train, no ticket, nothing. We rode all night. About six o\rquote clock we came into Lodz and we, all we had was a little rucksack. You know, we don\rquote t h
ave anything. So my brother he said, six, six thirty, he says, \ldblquote You stay here. I\rquote ll go look for him.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I want to go look for him.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote You\rquote re the youngest. I\rquote m the ol}{
\f0 d}{\f0 est. So you sit and I go.\rdblquote  \ldblquote O.K.\rdblquote  So he went and left me here. So I sat the

\i\f0 bramy}{\f0 , [gate] you know, to the hal}{\f0 l}{\f0 way there, and it was all white, and so people wrote names where they are. And so we looked, he looked, and he found Michael Filar is at }{\i\f0 Zalatska}{\f0  27 with Dr. Melamed. So here in 
fifteen to twenty minutes later he was there, knocked on the door. And they were in the partisans, so the old grandmother survived too. And she...

\par EM:\tab Oh, I see.

 And she opened the door and he went in there in the living room. He was sleeping on a sofa, and his foot was sticking out from under the cover. So he was...
\par EM:\tab Did he tickle it?
\par MF:\tab 
Tickling his foot a little bit and Michael opened his eyes, saw his brother. And I sat there half asleep at the railroad station. All of a sudden I see two of them coming at me. [weeping; tape off then on] I am rebuilding my piano, in spite of [tape off

Remember, when you were a young fellow at the Conservatory, I called you into my office? I always liked you, do you remember that?\rdblquote  \ldblquote I sure do.\rdblquote  \ldblquote What did I tell you then?\rdblquote  \ldblquote 
You told me to get out of Poland and go West, and you believed in me that I\rquote ll make a great career.\rdblquote  \ldblquote I\rquote m te

t tell anybody. We\rquote re already packed. We\rquote re leaving t}{\f0 o}{\f0 morrow morning.\rdblquote 
 And we went to Berlin, on the way to Frankfurt. And we stopped in Berlin and my brothers went to a committee, Jewish Committee for something. And I wanted to see the }{\i\f0 Reichstag}{\f0 , which was burned out by the Nazis. They said the R

\par EM:\tab Yeah, yeah.
\par MF:\tab So we decided to meet about one o\rquote clock for lunch at a\'85 it must have been about eleven in the morning, whatever. And I went in there. And I heard it was, a good part of i

\par EM:\tab Oh.
\par MF:\tab It was right, it was really funny to see it. I went up the stairs and there was an old German who worked there. And there was some officers. I think they were French, Russians, English or Americans probably. But I didn\rquote 
t know any English. But I knew French and I knew some Russian. And I saw the, what the old gentlemen were telling me. That was a very historic building. They didn\rquote t understand a word. I could see it. So I said to the French, to the Russians, 
\ldblquote I can translate from German into French and Russian.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh! A godsend you\rquote re here.\rdblquote  We, the French said it, not the Russians. The Russians didn\rquote 
t believe in God. So, I was translating for a while and then the Russian, the old German must have been in his eighties, he said, \ldblquote There\rquote s nothing much left here. It\rquote s all destroyed. Why don\rquote t we go over to the, }{\i\f0 
Reichskanzlei,}{\f0  the }{\i\f0 Reichs Chancellery}{\f0  of Hitler? That stands. It\rquote s not gone, you know. Everything\rquote s intact.\rdblquote  So they said, \ldblquote Fine.\rdblquote  But they pointed at me and said, \ldblquote 
You must go with us.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I\rquote d be delighted.\rdblquote  With a chance that I had a little }{\i\f0 D.K.W.}{\f0  }{\i\f0 D.K.W}{\b\i\f0 .}{\f0 
 today is called an Audi, you know with those four little zeroes in front. And they had a four seater so then we must have been about twenty pe}{\f0 o}{\f0 ple. So, the driver...so they went back and forth. It was about a three-minute ride one way. He cam
e back, and the two of us, the German and I, were sitting in the back, and two officers in the front. So that short ride the German says to me, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Sind Sie ein Russe}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  [Are you Russian?] I said, \ldblquote 
Sure, straight from Moscow.\rdblquote  I didn\rquote t want to talk to him. We arrived there, they\rquote re waiting, and there was no entrance for civilians. But it was generals, colonels, I don\rquote 
t know who the American, what rank the Americans and English were, but I knew the French, and the Russian some. So they didn\rquote t bother us, the four
...guards were there, the Americans, the English, the French, and the Russians. So we walked in and we saw, we walked in and I saw it on TV several times. You walk in there and there was first the Nazi Party room, was, I don\rquote 
t know, maybe forty, fifty meters long, maybe 100 feet, something like this, with a long, long table with chairs on all the side. At the end of it was Hitler\rquote s room. And I walked in, and I\rquote 
ll never forget it. I was shaking to see this. On the left was his desk. On the right was a stand with his }{\i\f0 Globus}{\f0  where he was, looked}{\b\f0  }{\f0 on}{\b\f0 , }{\f0 Chaplin}{\b\f0  }{\f0 played with that }{\i\f0 Globus}{\f0  in}{\b\f0  }{
\f0 a movie}{\b\f0  }{\f0 [unclear]}{\b\f0  }{\f0 or}{\b\f0  }{\f0 so. And that chandelier...a beautiful chandelier hanging, a long one, hanging down to almost, you almost could touch with your head. And one of the Russians lo
oked to me like he would be Jewish. I wanted to tell him that I was Jewish, too, and didn\rquote t know how. Finally I got an idea. And there was a moment and I said to him, \ldblquote Colonel, what\rquote d you think, what, don\rquote t you think it
\rquote s a beautiful Hanu}{\f0 k}{\f0 kah lamp?\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab [laughs]

 [Yeah, yeah, sure!] And he smiled. So I knew he was, you know. And then so, and then there was a little room there on the side. And there was a sink, you know, just a little washroom. And also a military bed, I guess, a }{\i\f0 prycza}{\f0 
. How do you say }{\i\f0 prycza}{\f0  in English? It was...
\par EM:\tab A cot?
\par MF:\tab A cot, which it was hanging out from the wall. You open it up. They say he stayed overnight sometimes. And then a German came out from a garden and he said, \ldblquote Why don\rquote t you go to the bunker? Down there, where he committed suicide.
\rdblquote  So we went out, and went down about two flights in concrete. And there was no electricity, you know, everything was bombed out. So who smoked had a lighter or matches. I smoked by tha
t time so I had matches and the German pointed to the door. He said, \ldblquote This is the room where he committed suicide.\rdblquote  So we went over. That was a white door. And we could\'85
 it was locked. And so the officers, big guys, you know, about six, seven foot or so, and they tried to open up and it was closed. They said, \ldblquote What do you mean it\rquote s closed? Let\rquote s open it up.\rdblquote  So I squeezed in be
tween them. And the Russian said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Davay}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 otkryvay}{\f0 !}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Roz}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 dwa tri.}{\f0 \rdblquote  We say one, two, three, and the French, you know, }{\i\f0 un, deux, trois}{\f0 , and the En}{

t dream I will break down that door.\rdblquote  It was just a, it\rquote s unbelievable. And we finally broke it down. We walked in there. There was a mess. There were a lot of people saying, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Strenggeheim}{\f0 ,\rdblquote 
 [top secret]. Everybody was taking souvenirs. But I knew I have to go to Frankfurt. That means a couple of hundred kilometers or more over the Russian Zone. And if they catch me with something like this, they\rquote ll call me a spy, and instead of Fran}
{\f0 k}{\f0 furt, the American Zone, I go to Siberia! So I didn\rquote t take anything. But we got through and we, I could have taken...and it\rquote s still eating my heart when I think about it. And we made it to Frankfurt...
\par EM:\tab Well what was in this bunker that you could have taken?
\par MF:\tab It said \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Strenggeheim}{\f0 .\rdblquote  I don\rquote t know what he wrote. Who would remember?
\par EM:\tab Oh, }{\i\f0 geheim}{\f0 , oh, it was }{\i\f0 geheim}{\f0 . It said\'85
\par MF:\tab \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Strenggeheim}{\f0 ,\rdblquote  yeah, top secret.
\par EM:\tab Top secret. Top secret things...
\par MF:\tab It was laying all over the floor. With matches and lighters, you know, we couldn\rquote t see much. They took it. I didn\rquote t want to look at it. I said, \ldblquote I know it\rquote s poison to me if I take it.\rdblquote  S
o, then we got to Frankfurt. There was a DP Camp outside of Frankfurt called Zei}{\f0 l}{\f0 sheim. We went in there.
\par EM:\tab What was it called, Salzheim?
\par MF:\tab Pardon me?
\par EM:\tab What was it called? I need to make...
\par MF:\tab Zeilsheim.
\par EM:\tab Zeils-...
\par MF:\tab Z-E-I-L-...
\par EM:\tab S-...
\par MF:\tab S-H-E-I-M.
\par EM:\tab O.K., Zeilsheim.
\par MF:\tab Zeilsheim. And they kicked...the Americans kicked the Germans out of a few streets and they gave us the houses to live.

\par MF:\tab So we are now in the DP camp in Zeilsheim, near Frankfurt.
\par EM:\tab Speak slowly.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. Well, they gave me a little upright piano. We had a nice little apar}{\f0 t}{\f0 ment, and because I was a pianist they gave us two rooms. In the kitchen there was a te}{\f0 r}{\f0 race, and underneath was a garage. I never expected I
\rquote ll one day have my car in there, that I will have a car.
\par EM:\tab Was this in a camp itself?
\par MF:\tab Yes. It was in a camp.
\par EM:\tab Oh, it was in a camp.
\par MF:\tab It was the Germans who were kicked out of there, and the American Army gave us. They took a few streets and they put us in there. So, since they found out I was a pianist, somebody gave me an upright piano. And the stove with a pipe going into the
\'85 I have pictures from that. And I started to practice. And we started, we found out that there were concerts on the radio station in Frankfurt. So my brothers and I, Michael and Joe, used to go to the concerts. And I remember I repeated the Chopin }{
\i\f0 E minor Concerto}{\f0 . I had it in my fingers already. So, I went once to a rehearsal of the orchestra. I could get in there. And when they finished I went up to the conductor. His name was Hans Bl\'fcmer, B-L-\'dc-M-E-R. And I told him, 
\ldblquote I\rquote m a pianist. I live just a few miles from here in this DP camp. And I was a graduate of a conservatory in Poland. And I would like to audition for you. Maybe you\rquote ll like me. Maybe we\rquote ll play a concert together.\rdblquote 
 So he said, \ldblquote Wait till the musicians leave, when it was over, and then I\rquote ll listen to you.\rdblquote  So that\rquote s what we did. I played about ten minutes. He stopped me and said, \ldblquote O.K., you\rquote re gonna play.\rdblquote 
 And I got my first concert. Now, he was supposed to be not a Nazi, because at that time, an}{\f0 y}{\f0 body who got a job had to be approven by the American authorities. So they checked him out, the CIA or somebody did. Somehow later they disc
overed that he lied on this paper which he filled out. He said he was not a Nazi, but he was. So they fired him. But after the concert came down the director of the }{\i\f0 Kammermusik}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Abteilung}{\f0 
, which is the chamber music department, and he asked me if I would pl
ay some solo work for them. They liked my playing. I got a very beautiful write-up. So I did. We became pretty good friends. He told me he was drafted into the army, into the German Army three weeks before the end of the war. He wasn\rquote 
t physically very fit. He looked it. So I believed him. He was lying. I found out thirty years later. He was here in Philadelphia. And he told me that he didn\rquote 
t play the piano, he was five years in the army. He forgot what he told me twenty years ago, but I remembered. But he was a nice fellow. I don\rquote t think he was a bad man. I doubt it very much. So I played and he liked it. And I said to him, 
\ldblquote Listen, I have a problem. I am at crossroads. I don\rquote t know what to do with myself because I didn\rquote t see the piano during the war; now I\rquote m back, so to speak, not completely, but I feel I\rquote 
m getting back in form. Should I go on playing the piano or should I quit because I\rquote m also interested in medicine?\rdblquote  Because we had some medical people in our family. And I said, you know, I was in my twenties then, I said, \ldblquote It
\rquote s a big hole in a young man\rquote s life, five years, at this age. And then to compete with the whole world, it\rquote s not such an easy thing.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Who are the great pianists around here? I\rquote 
d like to audition for somebody, because the review doesn\rquote t mean much. I don\rquote t know who the critic is, you know.\rdblquote  So he said, \ldblquote Gieseking is in Wiesbaden. Forty minutes on the train and you\rquote re there.\rdblquote 
 I said, \ldblquote Gieseking?\rdblquote  I knew who he was. He was god! You know, I heard him when I was a kid. I heard him in Wa}{\f0 r}{\f0 saw. He was one of the greatest pianists in the world. He played plenty in America. Ev}{\f0 e}{\f0 
rybody knew that. He died in \lquote 56. Actually he didn\rquote t die, he was killed, in a way, by doctors who made a mistake...
\par EM:\tab Yeah, well.
\par MF:\tab Operating on him.
\par EM:\tab Now you heard about Gieseking before, and you wanted to play for him.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. I didn\rquote t hear much. I was a kid at that time, but I knew that he was...around. First of all, I couldn\rquote t travel every, anywhere I wanted. I also knew that Wilhelm}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Backhaus was in Switze
rland. But I knew that Backhaus was a Nazi. So I wouldn\rquote t go anyway.
\par EM:\tab Backhaus, right.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. Very important sounding name, Backhaus. It actually means a bakery in English.
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab }{\i\f0 Backhaus}{\f0 .
\par EM:\tab }{\i\f0 Haus}{\f0 , right. So how did you get...
\par MF:\tab Anyway, so he gave me the address. I said, \ldblquote Do you know him? Could you write me a letter of recommendation?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote No. I know him. He doesn\rquote t know me from Adam. I\rquote m not gonna do anything for you. We
\rquote ll get you the address. And [unclear] you will go on the train. What are you gonna lose?\rdblquote  \ldblquote You mean just like that?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote So what? If he doesn\rquote t take you, so you\rquote 
ll be where you are right now.\rdblquote  I didn\rquote t want to go, because first of all I worried if he wasn\rquote t a Nazi during the war, and if he was, I wouldn\rquote t go. I didn\rquote t know. I didn\rquote 
t read papers in the concentration camp! They didn\rquote t deliver, you know. So, but there was a half-Jewish young lady by the name of Louisa Kahn, Lulu Kahn, we...and she married this lawyer, this Jewish lawyer, who survived in [unclear]. H
er father was Jewish. He was murdered. Her mother was not. Somehow she survived. So I asked her, \ldblquote Lulu, did you hear anything about Gieseking? What was he doing during the war?\rdblquote  So she said, \ldblquote 
All I know, he played concerts. As a matter of fact,\rdblquote  she says, \ldblquote I heard him play Mendelssohn\rquote s }{\i\f0 Songs Without Words}{\f0  in a concert.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Mendelssohn\rquote s }{\i\f0 Songs Without Words}{\f0 
? I\rquote m going. If he played this, then that tells me some\-thing. Whatever. So it\rquote s worth giving it a try.\rdblquote  So they gave me the address. It was }{\i\f0 Wilhelmina}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Strasse}{\f0 
 24. I went to Wiesbaden, came out of the train station\emdash ruins, left and right. So I ask her, \ldblquote Where is }{\i\f0 Wilhelmina Strasse}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  They showed me, \ldblquote Up the hill there, this way.\rdblquote 
 I go up there, pass some houses, and there was a field. Then I see }{\i\f0 Wilhelmina Strasse}{\f0  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and a field. And I have 24. So an old lady walks there with a sho}{\f0 p}{\f0 
ping bag, so I stopped her. I spoke pretty good German. And I said, \ldblquote I have an address here, }{\i\f0 Wilhelmina Strasse}{\f0  24, and this is 10 and there\rquote s a field. There\rquote s got to be a mi}{\f0 s}{\f0 take. There\rquote s no...
\rdblquote  \ldblquote No, no!\rdblquote  She says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Da unten am Kriegerdenkmal}{\f0 ...\rdblquote  where the monument for the war, you know, people, is there. \ldblquote There is a }{\i\f0 Wilhelmina Strasse}{\f0 . It\rquote 
s beautiful, sort of villas. Go down there. You\rquote ll find it.\rdblquote  I went. Here it was. I saw a bea}{\f0 u}{\f0 tiful villa, maybe five, six acres of land, a swimming pool, beautiful gate. I walked in, it\rquote 
s a three-story house, a garden, flowers, trees, just a dream of a place. And there were many doors. I didn\rquote t know, I just saw a button s
o I pressed it. Guess who opened the door? Mr. Gieseking himself. He was six foot five. I looked all the way up. And I didn\rquote t have any introduction so I talked fast. But I said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Herr}{\f0  }{\i\f0 Professor}{\f0 ,\rdblquote 
 I said, \ldblquote I\rquote m a pianist. I\rquote m a graduate of a conservatory in Warsaw. Maybe you heard...about my teacher, Pr}{\f0 o}{\f0 fessor Zbignew}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Drzewiecki, the head of the Chopin Society, the Director of the Cons-...
\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh yeah, yeah, very, very, sure, a very good man. I heard of him.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Could I, could you give, offer me ten minutes of your precious time? Could I talk to you?\rdblquote  I didn\rquote 
t go out there to study. I just wanted to know what to do with myself after so many years. I was at the crossroads. So he looked me up, you know, up and down. And I passed. So he says, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Kommen Sie}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 herein}{\f0 .
\rdblquote  So I went in. We went into the music room. A beautiful house. Two pianos, a big, big room. He sat at his desk. He said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Na, was wollen Sie}{\f0 ?\rdblquote  [What do you want?] I said, \ldblquote Professor, I am Jewish.
\rdblquote  First thing I said. I said, he doesn\rquote t like it, good-bye and I\rquote ll walk out}{\i\f0 .}{\f0  He didn\rquote t react. I said, \ldblquote 
I was in seven concentration camps. I lost my entire family except with a brother, and one who survived in Russia, and a sister who survived in Russia. But I lost over a hundred people in Warsaw. There\rquote s nobody left. 
My parents, my sister Helen, my first piano teacher, my brother Isaac, his wife and a little boy who was about three years old when he was murdered, uncles and aunts and cousins. And we were over a hundred people in Warsaw. There\rquote 
s nobody left. One cousin in Paris, and one in Chicago, and that\rquote s it.\rdblquote  So I said, \ldblquote Look, I played now with the orchestra, and I don\rquote t know, the review is very good. It doesn\rquote 
t mean anything. Could...you offer me ten minutes of your precious time? Could I play for you? And you will tell me what should I do. If you\rquote ll tell me it\rquote s too late, I\rquote m not good enough, whatever, and I\rquote ll quit, and I\rquote 
ll go into medicine. I\rquote m interested in medicine. Because your...word will mean everything to me, because that review means nothing. I don\rquote t know who wrote it. I have no idea.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh!\rdblquote  he said, \ldblquote 
I understand. But you\rquote re not the only one who wants to play for me. Why didn\rquote t you write? Just knocking on a door like coming in there and say, \lquote Here I am. I want to play for you.\rquote  You see, you think you\rquote re the only one?
\rdblquote  And he opens the drawer out of his desk, pulls out, I don\rquote t know, maybe twenty, thirty letters. \ldblquote People write to me from all over Europe. Why didn\rquote t you write?\rdblquote  So well, I looked at him and I said, \ldblquote 
Pr}{\f0 o}{\f0 fessor, did you answer all these letters?\rdblquote  So I got a smile out of him. He said, \ldblquote No, it\rquote s too much to write.\rdblquote  \ldblquote So I took a chance. You want me to go? I\rquote ll leave. I don\rquote 
t demand anything,\rdblquote  I said. \ldblquote I\rquote m just asking you for a chance.\rdblquote  \ldblquote No, no, no, no. I can\rquote t. You should have written. They put me on a black list. They said I was a Nazi. It\rquote 
s a damn lie. I had nothing to do with it.\rdblquote  I was amazed he talks so! He doesn\rquote t know me from Adam and here a few minutes he talks. \ldblquote No, no, you should have written. You should have written.\rdblquote  So I got up, and, of
 course, I was miserable. And he could see that I was miserable, b}{\f0 e}{\f0 cause there was nobody else. And I didn\rquote t know what to do with myself. Money I didn\rquote t have. I was poor as a church mouse. A passport I didn\rquote 
t have. I was a stateless person. I was a nobody. So I said to him, \ldblquote Well, I never had any, I didn\rquote t have any luck in the last five years. I\rquote ll probably never have it again in my life.\rdblquote 
 And I was ready to go. Somehow he saw it and he was honest and it touched him. So he said, \ldblquote Well, }{\i\f0 Sie sind schon hier. Setzen Sie sich hin und spielen Sie was vor.}{\f0 \rdblquote  [You\rquote 
re already here; sit down and play something.] Boy, I made it to first base! So he opened the piano. I played some Bach, or Mozart, or Beethoven. I don\rquote t remember exactly what it was. But then he says to me, \ldblquote You\rquote re Polish. Why don
\rquote t you play some Chopin?\rdblquote  So I played a G minor ballad and he flipped. He changed. He was not the same man. He started to smile and he put his arm around me. He said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 
Sie wollen das Klavierspielen aufgeben? Sind Sie wahnsinnig? Sie sind doch ein fertiger Pianist. Wollen Sie bei mir studieren, glauben Sie dass Sie bei mir was lernen k\'f6nnen?}{\f0 \rdblquote  I\rquote m quoting him verbatim. I\rquote 
ll never forget it, and so many years. He said, \ldblquote You want to give up playing the piano? Are you crazy? You\rquote re already a co}{\f0 n}{\f0 cert pianist! Do you want to study with me? Do you believe I can teach you something?\rdblquote 
 I said, \ldblquote God! Would you?\rdblquote  I didn\rquote t dare to think that far. \ldblquote How much will you charge me for a lesson?\rdblquote  And he said, \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Sie haben schon genug bezahlt}{\f0 .\rdblquote  [You alread
y paid enough.] He taught me five years and didn\rquote t take a cent. Why? I can come for a lesson every Thursday at 10:30. The phone doesn\rquote t ring. Everything is in ruins. \ldblquote Just come, that\rquote s all.\rdblquote 
 So, yeah, and I stayed for lunch. He invited me for lunch and I met his wife, his two little daughters at that time. And the older one had a boyfriend she married later, a Hungarian pianist, who lived there and Gieseking didn\rquote t like him. It
\rquote s quite a story. So what we ate for lunch was potatoes. So now the Germans didn\rquote 
t have anything. So I figured, we have in our DP camp we have, the provisions came from the American Army. We had it up to here. So I figured, he teaches me for nothing, I\rquote 
ll bring some stuff with me next week. So I did. And I came in and I started to unpack and he got angry at me. He said, \ldblquote 
Why did you do this? You had nothing to eat for five years. You must eat to get strength to be able to play the piano. If you bring it again, you won\rquote t get a lesson.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Professor, I apologize. I\rquote m sorry. But you 
know that I meant well.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Yeah, I understand, but don\rquote t do it again!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote O.K.\rdblquote  I figured, I\rquote ll outsmart you! And I came back the next week fi}{\f0 f}{\f0 
teen minutes earlier, and I brought the stuff with me all over again. But before he came down from upstairs, I planted all those cans all over the music room, under the piano, between the music, on the window sills, wherever I could find a, you know, I
\rquote d think this doesn\rquote t show, I stuck it in there. And I had my lesson and I went back home. The next week I come 
in and he looks at me. He looks at me. He liked that. You know, and it was kind of a funny thing for them. And he liked that sense of humor and he said to me, \ldblquote You know, this became a funny room.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote 
What do you mean, Professor?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Well, I go to take some music out of, you know, my bookcase there, and I take out a can of butter. Then I go to the window and see if it\rquote 
s raining, and I see a can of meat. Then I pull the chair up under the piano, a can of something else! What did I tell you!\rdblquote  And he\rquote s, you know, he\rquote 
s moving his finger at me. But he smiled. He loved it. It was so, it kind of broke the ice, you know? And then developed later on into a very wonderful, close friendship, I could say. He loved me. He really did.
\par EM:\tab So how long did you study with him?
\par MF:\tab Five years. One day I came in w-...
\par EM:\tab What year was that?
\par MF:\tab In \lquote 45, April of \rquote 45, till I went to America in 1950. And then when he was here, he had a piano in his hotel room and I always played for him. I had some other ones.
\par EM:\tab Now, tell me, so you lived in Zeilsheim all that time?

t remember exactly. We were kicked out of there by the American Army, General Hubner, who later became a friend. He said, \ldblquote Enough already. We have to go back to a normal life.\rdblquote 
 So we found an apartment in the city of Frankfurt, and I remember we rented a couple of rooms. And it was an apartment, yeah. I only paid some rent. It wasn\rquote t much, right next to the radio station.

\par EM:\tab Brothers, O.K.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. That was summer, so that was in }{\i\f0 Born}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Wiesenweg}{\f0  67, right next to the radio station }{\i\f0 Eschenheimer Land Strasse}{\f0 , was the radio station that time. Today they\rquote 
re on Dornbusch or someplace else. Anyway, so I got my piano in. Oh, yeah, Mr. Gembiki, the Jewish lawyer who came back from Canada, and became Assistant Provost Marshall of the city, he got me a piano, a grand, five foot seven. So, I had the pi-, so I go
t
 rid of the upright, and finally got a grand. And then when we moved into Frankfurt, [unclear] then Mr. Offie, Carmel Offie was the right hand of Ambassador William C. Bullitt. Offie was...how would you call it, he was working for the American government 
in Germany. And he was...
\par EM:\tab Well how do you spell his name?
\par MF:\tab O-F-F- like in Frank, I-E. He was with the State Department, and he was a big shot. He loved music. I met him through Judge Leventhal, Louis Leventhal, who was the political advisor to the Am
erican government in Germany for Jewish affairs. And I played a lot of concerts, and he came, and we met.
\par EM:\tab Well, where did you play the concerts in Frankfurt?
\par MF:\tab I played in the radio station. I played at recitals. I played a lot over the radio.
\par EM:\tab Did you make any money? Did you get paid?
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab You made money for that.
\par MF:\tab Sure, sure.
\par EM:\tab All right.
\par MF:\tab Not much, but it was all in old marks, you know, it was peanuts.
\par EM:\tab And so you played, and so you did have recitals, and you played all the time.
\par MF:\tab Yes, yeah, I did, with the orchestra and so on.
\par EM:\tab And you were taking the lessons...
\par MF:\tab I became quite well-known in Frankfurt.
\par EM:\tab And you...
\par MF:\tab And I played outside. I played in Wiesbaden, I played in Kassel, I played in Munich, I played in Hamburg, wherever. And Bad Homburg. I played in a lot of places.
\par EM:\tab What happened later?
\par MF:\tab Yeah. Well, so Mr. Offie told me he\rquote s going, but that must have been 1948. He\rquote s, yeah, the new marks came out then. And everybody could exchange forty new marks for forty old ones, that\rquote 
s it. But all of a sudden, everything which they robbed in Europe was for sale. Before this, before the new marks came out, there was nothing. All of a sudden everything\rquote s for sale. They pulled everything out. They were holding it f
or the new money. So I decided, so Offie wanted me to buy a piano for him, a grand. So I put an ad\emdash he was too busy, he was a very busy man with the government\emdash so I put an ad in the paper, \ldblquote I\rquote 
m looking for a beautiful Steinway or a Bechstein.\rdblquote  I didn\rquote t know
 anything about a Bechstein yet, because Mrs. Bechstein was one of the great friends of Hitler, which I found out when I was here already. Maybe a couple years, I bought a book, }{\i\f0 Who Financed Hitler}{\f0 ? And there it is. Didn\rquote 
t I ever show that to you?
\par EM:\tab No, no.
\par MF:\tab You won\rquote t believe it. So, well, Offie left, and I couldn\rquote t find anything. When they answered the ad, it was a junk piano. I said, \ldblquote I asked for a good instrument. What are you showing me? I\rquote m not interested.
\rdblquote  Then I got the idea, I said, \ldblquote He wanted a piano. That means that the pianos must be very expensive in the States. I won\rquote t be able to afford it. Why don\rquote t I buy a piano myself and take it to the States?\rdblquote 
 So I put in again an ad, and it, one, there were junk pianos and all that, but there was one interesting one, a doctor a}{\f0 n}{\f0 swered. \ldblquote I have a beautiful, what is it, seven-foot-five Steinway, you know. And if you\rquote 
re a concert pianist, something, you\rquote ll love that instrument.\rdblquote  So I went there, right near the railroad station, }{\i\f0 Bahnhof}{\f0 , right there. And I
 came in and the maid opened the door and showed me the piano. I walked in there. It was a beautiful apartment. A gorgeous instr}{\f0 u}{\f0 ment! Eighty years old, but hardly used! Like a new one! Beautiful! The doctor comes in and he says, \ldblquote 
Oh, Herr Filar, }{\i\f0 Sie bezahlen jeden Pfennig}{\f0 .\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote How do you know my name?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh, I heard you play. I love music. I go to concerts. So I heard you many times. You need that piano. You\rquote 
ll pay every cent for it!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote How much is it?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote Six thousand marks.\rdblquote  The dollar was fifteen marks. That was $400. I said, \ldblquote 
Where am I gonna get you six thousand marks? I got forty marks in the bank.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote If you want to buy that piano, you\rquote ll get the money.\rdblquote  If you have dollars, you could do it. And I had, I played in Lisbon. An
d I made some money there. And Gieseking got me some concerts, so I made some money, and I had a couple of thousand dollars or so. So I knew a black marketeer. Where you gonna get marks? So you have to talk with a guy. I saw him once on the street walking
 with a fiddle case. I said, \ldblquote You\rquote re a violinist? Since when?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Since no. I don\rquote t play the violin. I have a lot of marks in there. That\rquote s the only way to carry it!\rdblquote 
 It was funny. So I told him I found a piano I wanted to buy. He said, \ldblquote On you I won\rquote t make a cent. How much do you need?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Six thousand marks.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Give me $400. I\rquote 
ll get you 6000 marks.\rdblquote  In ten and twenty mark denominations. That\rquote s what it was, the whole suitcase, full of marks. And I bought the piano. It was a beautiful instrument. And I r
emember, I still lived in Zeilsheim at that time, just before we moved out, so I didn\rquote t have room where to put that piano. So I knew some people on a few streets away. So I asked the lady if she will rent me some room. I\rquote 
ll pay her for it monthly, whatever it is, and we\rquote 
ll put the piano there. She said, oh, she loves music. Fine. So I put it in there, and I called the piano tuner. He was a Bechstein man. And that was a Steinway. So, he came in and looked at it and says, \ldblquote Fine.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Let
\rquote s open it up and let\rquote s take a vacuum cleaner and clean out the dust from there.\rdblquote  He just told me he couldn\rquote t take the keyboard out. So I said, \ldblquote Let me try.\rdblquote  I pulled it out. He couldn\rquote 
t and I did. So he said, \ldblquote I\rquote m a Bechstein man, not a Steinway.\rdblquote  So the old lady who owned the house there, she jumped at him and said, \ldblquote Shame on you! You are a mechanic, and he pulled it out and you couldn\rquote 
t do it? You\rquote re an idiot!\rdblquote  She really let him have it.
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab Anyway, then I took the piano to Frankfurt, and when we moved in it was summer and the windows were open. I wanted to go to the piano and play, so I closed the windows and I started to play. The phone rings. A neighbor from across the street. 
\ldblquote Herr Filar, we know who you are. Why did you close the window? We love classic music!\rdblquote  That\rquote s the difference. \ldblquote Keep them open! We heard your concerts! We know who you are. Please unclose the windows.\rdblquote 
 So, well, I lived there, and I played a lot. And then, of course, the black market was a problem. And I needed a car. Well, who could aff
ord a car? Forget it. But the city of Frankfurt had used cars, some who were left from the war, private cars. And some who were taken away by the police from black marketeers, after it was a trial and whatever and they, because they were smuggling. So you
 had to have some protection to be able to buy a car like this, because they would sell it for the }{\i\f0 Reichsmarks}{\f0 .
\par EM:\tab You mean protection, you mean pull, you had.
\par MF:\tab Pull, yeah. It\rquote s called Vitamin...P.
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. So, I found out where it is. It belongs to the city. I went to the city hall. I came in there and he looked at me; he}{\b\f0  }{\f0 knew I am not German. And he said, \ldblquote Not, no, not, }{\i\f0 nicht}{\f0 , not today! Come next week.
\rdblquote  And I heard, \ldblquote Come next week,\rdblquote  I don\rquote t know, twenty, thirty times. Mr. Gembiki, who came 
back from Canada, bought a ruined house, rebuilt it, and created a center of beautiful music. Great people used to come there, the primadonnas from the opera house, American generals, General Hubner was there. He was the head of the First Army. And there 
w
ere some other officers from the American government. And I was there, I played. And then I told Mr. Gieseking about it, because it was fantastic food and drinks and wine. You name it, it was...like an oasis, you know. So one day they told me, so yeah, so
 I...when I went there I was told that I should...get a le}{\f0 t}{\f0 ter. If Mr. Gieseking would write me a letter that I\rquote 
m a concert pianist and I play, and I am not a black marketeer, and I need a car because the trains were overloaded with black marketeers. A ticket cost fifty cents to go, I don\rquote t know, six, seven, eight hours. So ev}{\f0 e}{\f0 
rybody was on that train. And I played once at the University of Marburg, and I stood on one leg for two hours, to get there. So I told Gieseking. He said, \ldblquote Well, I can do. I can write you a letter to the Minister of Culture,\rdblquote 
 which was in Wiesbaden. I took it. I went there. The doors opened up in a minute. That was a, you know, a magic letter. That name was...magic. So the Minister said to me, \ldblquote I have nothing to do with it, but I can, I\rquote 
ll write you a letter to the Transport Minister. He has something to do with cars.\rdblquote  So I went to him and I got a letter, that I deserved to get one for official price and so on and so forth. When I went there, it didn\rquote 
t work. Nothing worked. One day, one evening, on a Friday evening or a Saturday, weekend it was, there was a concert in Mr. Gembiki\rquote 
s home. And there was a Mr. Weber who was also in Buchenwald, a German. And he was an Assistant Provost Marshall or something in the city. He was a big shot in 
the City Hall. So I said to him, you know, and I played. And he liked that. So we became kind of friendly. So I said to him, \ldblquote Look, Herr Weber,\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I have this kind of a recommendation, from the Minister. And I can
\rquote t get a car. I go there, he tells me nothing. \lquote Come next week. Come next week.\rquote \rdblquote  So Mr. Weber started a laugh. And I said, \ldblquote Herr Weber, what is so funny?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote What\rquote s so funny? I
\rquote m the boss of that guy who sends you away! So you go there Monday.\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote What is this, Saturday? I\rquote ll go Sunday to a parking lot. I\rquote ll pick out the best car for you. You go to him Monday and he\rquote 
ll say, \lquote No,\rquote  and you tell him to call me. You\rquote ll see he knows my telephone number by memory. He\rquote ll dial it right away.\rdblquote  That\rquote s exactly what I did. I went there. The guy says, \ldblquote 
Nothing. Come next week.\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab I said, \ldblquote This time Herr Weber sent me.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Who?\rdblquote  \ldblquote So you heard me. Herr Weber.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh yeah?\rdblquote  \ldblquote He said if something\rquote s unclear you can call him.
\rdblquote  Before I said, \ldblquote Call him,\rdblquote  he was already dialing, without looking at the phone.
\par EM:\tab So you got the car.
\par MF:\tab So it was \ldblquote }{\i\f0 Jawohl Herr Weber, schon gut, ja, ja, stimmt}{\f0 .\rdblquote  [Yes sir, Mr. Weber, very good, yes, yes, agreed.] \ldblquote Blah, blah, blah. Come Thursday to get the key.\rdblquote  So Mr. Weber p
icked a car out for you.\rdblquote  It was an old Opel, built in 1938, and that was in 1947. Nine years old, or maybe ten years old.
\par EM:\tab So then...
\par MF:\tab I got it for three dollars.
\par EM:\tab For three dollars.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. And I had to buy the battery on the black market! That was more than the whole car.
\par EM:\tab O.K. So...
\par MF:\tab That\rquote s funny. And so, and I rode it till 1950 and I sold it for $500 before I went to the States. It was the best deal I ever made.
\par EM:\tab So how did you get to the United States? How did you get papers and come?
\par MF:\tab Well, there was a registration. Well, there was the Truman Act, about people, DP, displaced persons, who went through camps, were allowed to come to the States.
\par EM:\tab Tell me, you said something that you went to France for a while.
\par MF:\tab Yeah.
\par EM:\tab Could you tell me about that?
\par MF:\tab Well, yes. I had cousins in France, one cousin, Jeanette, and her brother, both married, had children already born in France. Her, their mother and my mother were si}{\f0 s}{\f0 ters. They also survived the Holocaust, but they landed in F
rance, and they stayed there. And the children were born, now they\rquote re French. They\rquote 
re French people. I wanted to find them. I wanted to see Paris. So I had all of twenty dollars in my pocket. And I got on a night train. And I went to Paris. I arrived there about six, seven in the morning. And they told me there\emdash I didn\rquote 
t have the address; I didn\rquote t know where they were; I was just going to look\emdash so they told me, \ldblquote There are little hotels around }{\i\f0 Gare de}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 l\rquote Est}{\f0 , the east station, there in Paris. But you better loo
k at a room before you take it, because they might rent rooms there for a short while or something.\rdblquote  So I went up to one room. They showed me. I said, \ldblquote Forget it.\rdblquote  And I walked out. And I went to a little caf\'e9
 there. I left my luggage at the railroad station. I had a bowl of some breakfast, and I bought a paper and I started to read French. I had six years of it in high school. I said, \ldblquote Hey! I know that! I know this and I know...\rdblquote 
 And then I walked there and look around. Then somebody calls me from behind. \ldblquote Marian!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Who\rquote s that?\rdblquote  \ldblquote What are you doing in Paris?\rdblquote 
 He was a former boyfriend of my older sister. He also survived and he was there. I said, \ldblquote Well, I came to look for my cousins, you know, the Mais.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote You\rquote re looking for your cousins? We
ll I know them. I know where they live. Let\rquote s go to a phone!\rdblquote  Just like that, and five minutes later I was talking to my cousin. He says, \ldblquote Come on over!\rdblquote  And they lived on }{\i\f0 Boulevard St. Michel}{\f0 
. I speak French, too. So I stayed there for a while. We saw Paris. We went sight-seeing. It was a fan-, fascinating, you know, experience after a horrible war. And then I was there again. I think it was in \lquote 48, yeah.
\par EM:\tab But you played there, didn\rquote t you?
\par MF:\tab Not yet. In \lquote 4-...
\par EM:\tab Oh, tell me about when you played.
\par MF:\tab No, when I first came I didn\rquote t. I...well I was just a tourist. I wanted to see Chopin\rquote s grave and...
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab You know, I saw the landmarks in Paris and all that.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, O.K.
\par MF:\tab And I revived my French. And I met some very interesting people. And I went back. Then I went again in 1948, and I stayed with them. And my cousin Jeanette said to me, \ldblquote There\rquote s a big manager coming from New York, we heard.
\rdblquote  They knew some people already. They were already domesticated in Paris. \ldblquote And he\rquote ll be in the Jewish Agency...\rdblquote  and what\rquote s the name of that [unclear].
\par EM:\tab The Joint?
\par MF:\tab What?
\par EM:\tab The Joint Distribution?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, American Joint, that\rquote s right. American Joint Distribution. \ldblquote So we got you a meeting here Friday morning at ten o\rquote clock you gotta be there. His name is Sol}{\b\f0  }{\f0 Hurok.\rdblquote  I had no idea who he was.

\par EM:\tab Sol Hurok?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, the biggest manager in the United States, who came to America from Russia without a cent in his pocket, by the way. I read a little book about him.
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab So, I came, so I went there. And the man who introduced me said that I am studying with one of the greatest pianists in the world, with Walter Gieseking. And he jumped at me, Hurok. He said, \ldblquote You\rquote re studying with that Nazi?
\rdblquote  \ldblquote Boy,\rdblquote  I said. \ldblquote I had no idea that he was a Nazi. I inquired before I went to...play for him. And I didn\rquote t read any papers in Buchenwald.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote They didn\rquote 
t deliver papers there. So, I heard from a half-Jewish lady that he was a decent man, and played Mendelssohn in a recital. And he helped me a great deal. I learned a lot, and he likes me a lot. He doesn\rquote t charge me a cent. As a matter of fact,
\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote he is gonna play in January of \lquote 49 in Carnegie Hall a r}{\f0 e}{\f0 cital.\rdblquote  And Hurok looks at me and says, \ldblquote He is not gonna play. I\rquote m telling you this.\rdblquote  I see that\rquote 
s...a war between the two. I had no idea. And I\rquote m right in the middle of it. \ldblquote I want to hear you play.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Well, I have a key to a small hall in }{\i\f0 Salle}{\b\i\f0  }{\i\f0 Playel}{\f0 .\rdblquote  That
\rquote s like Carnegie Hall, but in the basement are three smaller halls, for about three, four hundred people. And I had, through my cousin I got a key there and I could practice. And it was a good piano. \ldblquote O.K.,\rdblquote  he says, \ldblquote 
Monday morning at ten o\rquote clock we\rquote ll be there.\rdblquote  So I got there a little earlier, like nine maybe, get the key and go in there. It\rquote s not the same piano. A problem. And so it\rquote 
s a very average instrument. So I went back to the office and said, \ldblquote What happened? Why this change?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh, we had a concert last night in the big hall. We needed two pianos for the
 Mozart Concerto for two pianos. So we took the good one out. And it will be back there tonight.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Tonight is too late.\rdblquote 
 Anyway, Hurok came in with a photographer and press people, whatever. He came in with ten, fifteen people and some others he wa
nted to hear. I played for him and he liked it. As a matter of fact, I was the only one he took a picture with. So I have this picture. I showed it to you. And he said to me, \ldblquote I am ready to take you to America. I\rquote 
ll be glad to take you to America. Are you ready to be hungry for the first five years?\rdblquote  I felt like somebody hit me in the face. What I went through, I came out of...maybe I weighed about, I don\rquote 
t know, eighty pounds, something like that. I was half dead. I looked like a living skeleton. And here comes a rich uncle from America, offers me to be hungry again for the next five years. I wish he would try. He\rquote 
ll find out what it is, because I know very well. But I didn\rquote t answer. I didn\rquote t say anything. But I said to him, \ldblquote Well, Mr. Hurok, if you liked m
e on this piano, I just bought a beautiful old instrument, a Steinway, hardly played, in Frankfurt. Maybe you\rquote ll be in Frankfurt. So, if you will be, I\rquote ll...if you liked me on this piano, I\rquote m sure you\rquote 
ll like me a lot better on a beautiful instrument.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh,\rdblquote  he said, \ldblquote as a matter of fact, yes, I\rquote ll be in Frankfurt next week. Give me your phone number. I\rquote ll call you.\rdblquote 
 And I was supposed to go back. In the meantime, Gieseking, before I met Hurok, Gieseking was in Paris. He was in the American Embassy. He got a visa for the States, for January. He i}{\f0 n}{\f0 
troduced me to some very important musicians in Paris, the top people there. And I met\'85

\par MF:\tab Yeah, so Mr. Gieseking introduced me to those people. So I told him when he left already, went back, I don\rquote 
t know where he went, but he was not in Paris any more. But I saw those French people. I told them what happened, who I met, and so on. They got really i}{\f0 n}{\f0 censed. They said, \ldblquote 
The nerve to offer you, after the hell you went through, to be hungry?\rdblquote  I...well, today I realize maybe it was just a matter of speech. Maybe he said, \ldblquote It won\rquote t be so great in the beginning.\rdblquote 
 But what, I took it literally. I couldn\rquote t understand it any different. So they said, \ldblquote No, well you\rquote re not going back to Frankfurt. We have an audition for you here with the Symphony Orchestra called }{\i\f0 Orchestre}{\b\i\f0  }{
\i\f0 Cologne}{\f0 ,\rdblquote  a very famous orchestra in France. \ldblquote And you will play with the Symphony in Paris. You\rquote 
ll get to America without him. You live in the American Zone. There is some law passed by the...President in Congress that you pe}{\f0 o}{\f0 ple will be able to go to the States anyway. You need him like a hole in the head.\rdblquote  Well, I didn
\rquote t know who he was. 
I had no idea that he was such a big manager. So, and I was young, unexperienced, and these were very important people. So I listened to them, and I stayed, and I had the audition, played for the conductor of the orchestra. And I got a concert. I played, 
for the last concert in Europe before coming here. And I came here on March 3, 1950, just two weeks before. So I played in Paris with the Symphony. I got a great success. So I got back a little later, and my brother Michael said to me, \ldblquote 
A man called here. He said his name was Sol Hurok. He asked for you. And I told him you were still in Paris, so he hung up.\rdblquote  And I met another man. When I came here, you know, a few months later, I found out who Hurok was. I said, \ldblquote 
Boy, did I make a mistake. I had no idea,\rdblquote  I said. \ldblquote What kind of an enticing propos}{\f0 i}{\f0 tion is to go to the States to be hungry?\rdblquote  I wasn\rquote 
t hungry in Europe. I was doing great. I had a car, I had a beautiful piano, I had a beautiful apartment and a maid. I want to go to America and be hungry? Who needs 
it? Well, anyway, so I tried to reach him. I tried to call him up and explain what happened. Maybe he\rquote ll understand. Uh oh, \ldblquote Mr. Hurok is in Europe. Oh, what\rquote s your name?\rdblquote  I told him. \ldblquote 
Mr. Hurok is on the moon. Mr. Hurok is in hell. Mr. Hurok is here and there.\rdblquote  He don\rquote t want to see me. It was quite obvious. Not only he didn\rquote 
t want to see me, but years later I found out that he actually stopped my career, in a way, if you want to say that. And it was a pretty dirty thing to do. Because I did play. I did pla
y with Ormandy fourteen times and I was with the Philadelphia Orchestra. I had my debut with the Philade}{\f0 l}{\f0 phia Orchestra in Carnegie Hall with Ormandy conducting, played a Chopin F minor Co}{\f0 n}{\f0 
certo. And I played in Chicago. I played in Washington with the Symphony. I played all over. But how long can you go on playing by yourself, trying to get your connections, some from Europe, so on? You need a manager. You can\rquote 
t do everything by yourself because you have to practice. You don\rquote t even have time to sleep. You can\rquote t do it. So I started, so som}{\f0 e}{\f0 body wrote a letter, right even at the beginning, when I didn\rquote 
t know English yet. Somebody from Europe wrote a letter of recommendation to the Vice President of Columbia Concerts the biggest management. He was called Andr\'e9
 Mertens. It was a Jewish fellow from Berlin. I got an appointment, came in there. He kept me waiting in the waiting room for about an hour. That\rquote s the way they were doing it, to soften you up. So you come in and you\rquote 
re already beat before you even open your mouth. So I come in there and I told him in German, and I said, \ldblquote Mr. Mertens, I came here...\rdblquote

\ldblquote You understand. You understand.\rdblquote  And I said, \ldblquote But I don\rquote t.\rdblquote  A
nd again, he played ping pong with me, going back and forth. He was making an idiot out of me. I got up and I left. And I remember I had tears in my eyes in the elevator. I said, \ldblquote 
What a bum! What a crude guy! Why would he do it to me, for what reason?\rdblquote  Th
en I went to Marx Levine, he was the President of NCAC. That was the second biggest organization in the States. And he greeted me when I walked in. He knew my name, whether it was by pictures in the paper and all that. That was later on. And he says, 
\ldblquote Yeah! Well I know all about you! You have all the concerts. You get better concerts what I can get for my artists! You don\rquote t need a manager. You\rquote re saving money.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Mr. Mar-, Mr. Mer-, Morris, yeah,
\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I am not saving money. I just know some people from Europe. I had a few auditions. They liked me and I\rquote m playing. But I need management. Why don\rquote t you take me? Whatever your fee is, I\rquote

s how he paid me back. I found out years later. Well, how long can you go on, you know, like this? And at the beginning, when you\rquote re not known, you\rquote re being paid peanuts. What do you think they pay you? So I start
ed to look since I played a lot in Philadelphia with the Philadelphia Orchestra. So I looked around and they offered me a job as the head of the piano department at the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia. It was in 1953, and the pay was good for a re
f
ugee from camp. And I started to make good money. And I started to teach there in the piano department. And I was very successful. I had ten kids who won eighteen performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Two of them best students from Curtis Institut
e. One was Charles Birnbaum, the other was Beth Levine. Beth played a Beethoven Third Piano Concerto. Charlie played a Chopin concerto.

\par MF:\tab And then Temple University opened up in \lquote 57. Dr. Stone who was the Dean\emdash I mean the College of Music opened up\emdash invited me to join the faculty. And I remember I, so I talked to him on the phone and I said, \ldblquote 
Well, why don\rquote t we meet?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Wonderful. Where can we meet?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote In front of the Academy of Music.\rdblquote  And I said, \ldblquote Dr. Stone, how do you look like?\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote 
You don\rquote t have to know how I look like. I know how you look like. I saw you at the Academy. I heard your concerts.\rdblquote  So we met. He turned out to be a wonderful friend. He just had his

s how it started. And then I saw that my life setttles, and I used to commute. I lived in New York the first ten years. So from \lquote 53 to \lquote 59 I used to go from New York to Philade}{\f0 l}{\f0 
phia. I drove there. We had a car. And I drove once a week. I came here Wednesday around noon time, and went back Friday night. Oh yeah, that was an interesting story. The director of the school called me once, it was Friday, and he says, \ldblquote 
When are you going back to New York?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Tonight.\rdblquote  \ldblquote Well, I got news for you. But I think you\rquote ll stay till tomorrow.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote It better be good, because I\rquote m going home.
\rdblquote  He says, \ldblquote No, you\rquote re not.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Why not?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Guess who is coming to meet you?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Who?\rdblquote  Danny Kaye. I said, \ldblquote 
Danny Kaye? That great actor? Why does he want to meet me?\rdblquote  \ldblquote Oh, he was at a dinner with some member from the Philadelphia Orchestra.\rdblquote  And they talked about me, about the hell I went through, so he wanted to meet me. 
\ldblquote He\rquote ll be here tomorrow, at school tomorrow morning at ten o\rquote clock.\rdblquote  \ldblquote O.K., I\rquote m staying.\rdblquote  He came in, there w
as a write-up in the neighborhood. The kids found out...you know, he was a great kid lover, and had movies for kids and all. So it was a riot there}{\b\f0  }{\f0 
when he came in. And I played for him and this and that, and then it was pretty nice and I said, \ldblquote Mr. Kaye, I have to admit, I apologize, I know who you are, of course. You\rquote 
re a very famous actor. But I never saw you in person on the stage or in the movies. I never had the privilege.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote When are you coming back to Philadelphia?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I\rquote ll be back coming Wednesday.
\rdblquote  \ldblquote There\rquote ll be a ticket for you in the box office, for you, and come back stage.\rdblquote  So I did. And I was handing him out his paraphernalia. You know, a hard hat, a cane, whatever it was. And then he did a trick, I\rquote 
ll never\emdash for the pu}{\f0 b}{\f0 lic\emdash I\rquote ll never forget. He sat, it was after intermission, I think\emdash he sat down on the stage dangling his feet from the stage\emdash and he invited the public in three groups. He said, \ldblquote 
From this row to this row. When I give you a sign you all yell out.\rdblquote  It was packed, in the Schubert Theater. Two thousand people were there. He said, \ldblquote You yell out loud, \lquote Hi!\rquote \rdblquote  So they said, \ldblquote O.K.
\rdblquote  He gave them a sign, \ldblquote Hi!\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Fine, shut up. Now the next group.\rdblquote  That\rquote s how he was talking. \ldblquote When I give you a sign, you yell out loud, Fi!\rdblquote  They didn\rquote

That was easy! You should have seen the trouble I had with Piatigorsky in California!\rdblquote  You know, it was a lot more difficult.

70s I got a letter from my sister telling me that Simon died. Her husband died. And he was a best friend of my older brother. He was, they were from Warsaw also. So I went to a, I mean a card store, and sent her a sympathy card. I got a call from Paris. 
\ldblquote Why don\rquote t we meet? Are you married?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote No.\rdblquote  And so she came to Philadelphia. And I [unclear] married. And I was, 
she said she would live in Philadelphia. And we had a lot of vacation at Temple, as you know. And first of all I took a leave of absence for one semester, and so I spent oh, about, more than half a year. And I played there before. All right? And I love he

 So, we parted as friends. And I visited her many times after the divorce, you know.
\par EM:\tab Yeah. Now, you also traveled a lot in Europe and other places, too, and you played, right?
\par MF:\tab Yes.
\par EM:\tab And so, could you tell me a little bit about where you played?
\par MF:\tab Well, I played all over. First of all in, I played in France, all over Germany. I played in England, in Holland, and Denmark, and Norway, and Sweden. I played in Portugal. I played in Israel with the Israeli Philh
armonic twenty concerts in thirty days. When the war broke out in 1956, the Sinai Campaign, I was there.
\par EM:\tab In, during the Sinai Campaign.
\par MF:\tab Yeah. And they, I had two more concerts to play and they released me from the contract. But I didn\rquote t want to leave. I said, \ldblquote I wasn\rquote t running from Hitler; I\rquote m not going to run from Nasser.\rdblquote 
 And I finished my concert tour. And I was later invited to be a judge in the Rubinstein Competition.
\par EM:\tab And tell me, you did win many awards. Could you mention a few?
\par MF:\tab What?
\par EM:\tab You won some awards and...
\par MF:\tab Oh well yeah, I got a silver medal from the Rubinstein Competition.
\par EM:\tab And...
\par MF:\tab I was supposed to play, in 1942 in the Chopin competition in Warsaw.
\par EM:\tab \lquote 42?
\par MF:\tab \lquote 42, but there was no competition.
\par EM:\tab Oh, oh.
\par MF:\tab The Germans were there. Chopin was forbidden, there was nothing.
\par EM:\tab O.K.
\par MF:\tab So I missed my opportunity. Because I was ready.
\par EM:\tab Could you tell me a little bit of your life now? You, I understand you...
\par MF:\tab I\rquote m retired. I\rquote m a retired professor enjoying my life, going to competitions here and there, judging.
\par EM:\tab But, you\rquote re judging.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, I\rquote m judging some competitions, some very fine ones. I was just a couple of months ago in Miami. That was the national Chopin contest, and the winners are gonna go to Warsaw in October. There\rquote

\par EM:\tab O.K. Now, as you...

\ldblquote O.K., you\rquote ll fly to LaGuardia,\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote I will pick you up at the airport and I\rquote ll be holding the Schuman Piano Concerto in my hand high, so you\rquote ll see me, like that.\rdblquote  And he said, \ldblquote 
I know what you look like.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Never mind. I\rquote ll have the music in my hand.\rdblquote 
 So he came. I liked him and so on. Then I started to commute there, and I met a very great man, became very great friends. I was in his office in the Pent}{\f0 a}{\f0 gon. I swam at the Pentagon swimming pool. I was working harder; well,}{\b\f0  }{\f0

\par EM:\tab Mmm hmm, oh, mmm hmm.
\par MF:\tab With the General. I have it.
\par EM:\tab Could you tell me a little bit more about your life in the ghetto? I wanted to go back into the ghetto.
\par MF:\tab Oh God. That was hell on earth. I was away in Lemberg during the war.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, we have that on tape.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, then I came back in December of 1941.
\par EM:\tab I am especially interested in your playing in the ghetto, when you were playing [unclear].
\par MF:\tab Yeah, O.K. Now, there was a Symphony Orchestra in the ghetto. And very few people mention this. It\rquote 
s really a shame. It was a wonderful orchestra. Many of the members of that orchestra were members of the Warsaw Philharmonic. And the conductor was a very wonderful cellist by the name of Marian Neutajch.
\par EM:\tab Neutajch?
\par }\pard\plain \s18\qj\fi540\li720\sl400\slmult1\nowidctlpar\tx1800\tx5760\tx6210\tx7200\adjustright {MF:\tab 
Neutajch. N-E-U-T-A-J-C-H. And he was a fine conductor, and I played with him in the ghetto the Tchaikovsky Concerto. Well, in the ghetto, my parents were at that concert, and my sister Helen. They all perished. And how did we do
 it? We announced that the Ge}{r}{man wouldn\rquote t permit us to play anything but Jewish composers. So in front of the hall, act}{u}{ally it was a movie house, which was built just before the war, and the government and the city of Warsaw didn\rquote 
t permit it to be opened because it was one or three feet too close to a church. There was a law then. Now the church was also in the ghetto, so they made a concert hall out of it, Anatiera. [phonetic] So we announced in front of the hall this, an announc
}{e}{ment we\rquote re playing Mendelssohn Concerto. And we brought the music from the Polish side, from Polish friends, you know? This music was smuggled in and we played a Tchaikovsky. I also played chamber music with a young violinist\emdash 
I was young myself at that time\emdash by the name of David Z
ajdel, Z-A-J-D-E-L, a wonderful, wonderful talent. Unfortunately he was murdered. We played chamber music, publicly, on Orla Street I think it was, in Warsaw, by the side street of Leszno, if I remember correctly.

\par EM:\tab Did you get paid for the...
\par MF:\tab Pssh, pssh...
\par EM:\tab You don\rquote t remember?
\par MF:\tab I really don\rquote t remember, no. But I remember once when...the atrocities started and then the money was scarce. I mean we were bombed out, you know. They cleaned my f}{\f0 a}{\f0 ther\rquote 
s business out. It was...people were just poor like church mice. So, Marian Neutajch said to me, \ldblquote You need to make some money?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Of course!\rdblquote  \ldblquote I got a job. I\rquote m creating a trio. We\rquote 
ll play in a caf\'e9, popular music. I have a professional violinist who is a caf\'e9 mus}{\f0 i}{\f0 cian. And it\rquote s in a nice, new caf\'e9 opened up. So we\rquote 
re gonna have a rehearsal, the three of us. And they will pay us enough to buy a bread, for the whole evening.\rdblquote  That was, bread was life. So we went in to rehearse and this professional violinist was giving us hell!
\par EM:\tab Why?
\par MF:\tab It was something! We had a rehearsal, he said, \ldblquote You\rquote re a great musician and you can\rquote t play 1-2-3 in time!\rdblquote  Like a waltz or something. I said, \ldblquote All right.\rdblquote 
 And I had a piano there, an upright piano. I said, \ldblquote I want to play it so that I\rquote ll face the wall. I don\rquote t want an}{\f0 y}{\f0 body to see me.\rdblquote  And we played one evening, and that was the end of it. The next day started 
the atrocities. But I came home with a bread.
\par EM:\tab And so, but, and so you only could play in the evening. During the day you worked at that [unclear]?
\par MF:\tab No, they, only that one night. Then it was over.
\par EM:\tab Oh.
\par MF:\tab They started to...
\par EM:\tab Oh, oh.
\par MF:\tab Send people to the concentration camps. It was just one night.
\par EM:\tab All right.
\par MF:\tab Just one night, that\rquote s all.
\par EM:\tab All right. Anything else you would like to add?
\par MF:\tab Yeah, how I lost my father. I came, I don\rquote t know why I was in town some\-where and I get through and I came home. My mother said, \ldblquote Father is gone.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote What do you mean?\rdblquote 
\par EM:\tab Yeah.
\par MF:\tab He was going to the }{\i\f0 Yiddischer Gemeinde}{\f0 , to the Jewish...
\par EM:\tab Well...
\par MF:\tab Did I tell you that before?
\par EM:\tab Yeah, we have that already. Yeah, you...
\par MF:\tab And they caught him on the street.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, we have that...
\par MF:\tab They closed the street.
\par EM:\tab On the tape.
\par MF:\tab Yeah, and then the uprising and the rest you know.
\par EM:\tab Yeah, so...
\par MF:\tab And here I am, so many years later. But you know, we had a little villa outside of the
 city in Warsaw. And there...someone, a Gypsy woman used to walk around yelling that they lay cards, tell you the future and all of that. And I was a little boy at that time. And she said, \ldblquote Come on, give me your hands.\rdblquote 
 And she, so put some cards on the table. She says, \ldblquote You\rquote re gonna go beyond the big, big water.\rdblquote  She kind of predicted I\rquote ll be going to the States. It\rquote s unbelievable. I never forgot that. Yeah.
\par EM:\tab All right, Professor Filar, thank you very much.
\par MF:\tab You\rquote re quite welcome.
\par EM:\tab If there is anything else you want to add, you know, I\rquote ll, that\rquote s all.
\par MF:\tab Well, what I want to add, I would like to see in this country a Ministry of Culture. I would like our government to be a little more for culture. They leave it all to private people. And all those 
civilized societies, France, England, Germany, Italy, all have Ministries of Culture. And they contribute to culture a lot more. Too bad I don\rquote t have the cut-out from }{\i\f0 The New York Times}{\f0 
. I just saw a couple of weeks ago, I think, how much our government spends on culture, how much France spends, how much England spends, and Germany. I was ashamed to read it. That\rquote s all I can say.
