}{\plain \par
}{\plain Father was Solomon Winter, born August 29, 1871 in Wittelshofen\par
}{\plain Mother was Hedwig Winter, born 2/6/1874.  In B\'fctthard by W\'fcrzburg\par
}{\plain SF: Spell Wittelshofen\par
}{\plain FF: I hate to do that.\par
}{\plain SF:  Where is it located?\par
}{\plain FF:  In Bavaria\par
}{\plain Mother\'92s maiden name was Sichel.\par
}{\plain I know my grandparents names but not when they were born.  Mother\'92s mother\'92s name was 
Malie (or Mallie?) Sichel.  Mother\'92s father\'92s name was Simon Sichel\par
}{\plain My father\'92s mother\'92s name was Hanna Winter, maiden name Monheimer.\par
}{\plain Grandfathers\'92s name was Falk Winter. \par
}{\plain Grandmother was about 80 about \'9122.  Died in 1922.  and never knew my grandfather.\par
}{\plain Never knew mother\'92s parents too.  Never knew either grandfather.\par
}{\plain My parents married in 1899.  They were matched.  Introduced and the man who introduced 
mother to father said that father comes from wealthy parents.  Only trouble in family is red hair.  
If she doesn\'92t mind red hair, he is the only child so she will do very well.  So my mother said it 
doesn\'92t bother me, I have to see the man. When she was introduced she really fell in love with 
him and I don\'92t blame her, I would have too.  \par
}{\plain Set up by a matchmaker. When my mother\'92s parents died, she moved to her sister who was 
married and her sister\'92s husband was a teacher and a cantor.  The cantor and teacher in our home 
town was a friend of his and that how he ur... not really a matchmaker but a friendly 
matchmaker.  Actually through a mutual friend.\par
}{\plain SF:  Like how Ginny and I met on a blind date.\par
}{\plain SF:  Describe your parents. \par
}{\plain FF:  My grandmother was extremely smart but I didn\'92t like her too much.  Very bossy.  \par
}{\plain SF:  Comes naturally\par
}{\plain FF: Why do you have to look at each other like that.  In fact when the minister in our town 
wanted a special sermon written up he came to my grandmother and she could write like a writer.  
She was very bright. And my parents were very good people, very honest people, very charitable 
people.  They helped everybody.  Everybody.  No matter what religion or whatever.  Color they 
didn\'92t have at that time.  In fact one beggar came to town and my parents were away.  They were 
away.  They were invited somewhere. When he got off the bus someone said to him \'91Fra\'fc Winter 
isn\'92t home today\'92 so he said \'91I might as well go\'92 because if my mother wasn\'92t home he wouldn\'92t 
come.  And the Jewish schnorrers they used to call, came every few weeks.  He ate by us, he 
slept by us.  And for a while he didn\'92t come and my parents knew where he came from so they 
called up the Jewish community there and he(had) died. And he left my mother all his earthly 
goods, which were 100 marks, and my mother went and took the 100 marks and got him a 
tombstone.  That\'92s how good my parents were.  \par
}{\plain We had every year from the, what do you call that, orphanage in Furth where Ida was.  We had 4 
boys all summer and we dressed them with shoes and everything and we sent them back again.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain For years.  I was in love with one and I wrote it on a post card.  The president of the school 
called my father and he told me never to write things like that on a postcard.  What did I know.  
That was really great.  It was a good, good home.\par
}{\plain My mother was very good looking and my father was, to me, very good looking too.  My father 
was very tall.  This is my daddy.  That\'92s the hometown.  \par
}{\plain Ruth: And he had a red beard, right.\par
}{\plain SF:  And a mustache.  Did he have a beard or just a mustache?\par
}{\plain FF:  Had a mustache.  And your (Ruth\'92s) mother was the only one who resembled my father in 
size, in tall he was about like Uncle Leo.  Not quite that tall but tall.  Not stocky.  He was well 
proportioned but not fat.\par
}{\plain My mother used to be very beautiful but in the later years she got stout.  She got stout.  You 
know they ate a lot of .... I don\'92t know.  She was stout.\par
}{\plain SF: What peculiarities do you think of when you think of your parents?\par
}{\plain FF:  I never think of any peculiarities (habits).  \par
}{\plain SF: They were good people, generous people, and your father always looked the other way with 
whatever you did.\par
}{\plain FF: You bet.  And my mother didn\'92t approve of it.  I never could find anything wrong with my 
parents.  I was very young when I left and whenever I came home I really had a good, good time.  
I was lazy and didn\'92t want to do any work.  And my mother always said \'93child, one time in life 
must everyone work and someday it is going to hit you and you better start at home.\'94  Of boy, 
did I learn.  Huh?\par
}{\plain SF:  What did your father do?  FF: He was a cattle dealer.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did your mother do during the day?\par
}{\plain FF:  Huh.  She had a house.  We had two maids.  We had a man who worked for us and two 
maids.  And we had, what\'92s you call it, where the cows go in.  We had a big barn. The green 
grass. The pasture.  And we had further away those pastures.  They had to be gone after.  Then 
we had a very big garden with all kinds of fruit: apples, pears, plums, nuts, and the gardens they 
were...and we had beautiful gardens with every vegetable under the sun.  We never bought 
vegetables.  We never bought salad.  We never bought fruit.  We grew all the stuff like that.  
Cherries, everything.  We even grew flowers.  Anything there was we never bought.\par
}{\plain SF: What did you do in the wintertime?\par
}{\plain FF: We kept them.  They were sterilized in jars and they were in those big jars.  And there was a 
thermostat in the middle of them.  Boiled them in a big vat. We had them in the hundreds.  The 
food had to be taken care of, in the cellars.  We had big cellars.  I told you our house was built on 
the cellars of a castle.  And in the cellars we had those big...they were like closets and you pulled 
out the drawers and they were full of apples and then on the ground we had earth and in the earth 
we buried red beets and all those kinds of things.  They last(ed) from one winter until the spring.  
Beets were kept in the bushels and kept in the sand.  Big sacks were on pieces of paper.  And the 
apples.  Auch, did we have apples.  We  had a cellar twice the size of this room and the wooden 
things in which the apples were, were all around.  When the name was written on, what kind of 
apples they were.  And the other thing was for the wine.  \par
}{\plain SF:  Did you make your own wine?  FF: No we bought it.  And beer for the summer.  We had a 
big barrel of beer.  It was a good life.  You would have enjoyed it.  Oh God, how you would have 
enjoyed it as a child, to come to a place like this.  You didn\'92t appreciate it because that\'92s all you 
knew.  It was hard work.  But that\'92s all they had to do, really.  I mean there wasn\'92t... no woman 
had to ever work.  \par
}{\plain SF: What kind of transportation did they have?\par
}{\plain FF: My father had a horse and ...you know like they have in the Pennsylvania Dutch...they have 
those buggies.  Heavier buggies.  In the winter he had a sled because you couldn\'92t use the wagon.  
\par
}{\plain SF: You didn\'92t have a car?\par
}{\plain FF:  No. Motorcycle.  \par
}{\plain SF: You had a motorcycle?  \par
}{\plain FF: Bianca\'92s father had a motorcycle.  SF: Was it a BMW.  FF:  No.  It was a triumph.  I had two 
bicycles.  \par
}{\plain My older sister was Marta and my other sister\'92s name was Gerda.  My older sister was born 
August 1}{\plain \super st}{\plain , 1900 in Wittelshofen and Gerda was born May 17, 1903.  Marta married Samuel 
Bravman.  He was born February 10, 1893 and Gerda married Emmanuel Danzig who was born 
on July 29, 1895.  Marta and Samuel met in Wittelshofen.  He lived there; he came back after the 
first World War and that\'92s how they met.  I was 6 years old and don\'92t know any of the details.  
Gerda met Emmanuel through a friend of mine.  I told that friend that I have a sister who is older 
than me who I would love to come to M\'fcnchen.  He invited her and they fell in love, they really 
fell in love.  But he always loved me.  He always told me he loved me.  In a different way.  \par
}{\plain Samuel was a cattle dealer together with my father and Ruth\'92s father was first a procorist (sp? 
and word?).  He worked for Truler (name?) procorist.  Like an accountant.  In the accounting 
line.  He had education for it.  And later they moved away.  The firm was sold to a firm in 
England and they moved to England (the firm) and then her father worked for the temple.  First 
he held mincah service and then he did everything.  He was the shamus and the banus and 
the...he did everything there was to do in the temple. He held the afternoon services and all that. \par
}{\plain And then one boy, Sigbert, my favorite, was born to Marta and Samuel.  He was born September 
19, 1923.  He was just a pride and joy to everybody.  That\'92s Bianca\'92s brother.  He was really 
something.  \par
}{\plain Sigbert became a baker.  He was so smart but you couldn\'92t send him to school (because of the 
times).  He would have outdone anybody.  So Ida worked in Karlsruhe in her uncle\'92s bakery and 
they brought him there as a baker. She said he was one of the best.  He was really the pride and 
joy to everyone. \par
}{\plain Ruth: Where does Ida fit in? \par
}{\plain FF:  Ida\'92s uncle married my sister.  Ida was a friend who lived in the same town.  Ida\'92s mother 
was a widow.  Her maiden name was Bravman.  And my sister married the Bravman.  So Ida is 
not related to me at all, but she called my sister Aunt Marta and her husband Uncle Samuel and I 
wanted her to call me Aunt Flora and she wouldn\'92t do it.  We went to school together.  \par
}{\plain First, the Turner and Weiler. Their father\'92s name was Sichel and he was a brother of my mother.  
My father had no brothers or sisters.  He was an only child.  My mother had 12 brothers and 
sisters.  There were 12 children altogether.  One cousin is Aunt Saler.  Her mother was a Sichel.  
And there was another sister and she had two sons and a daughter and the two sons were in the 
first World War. One was killed in action and one was at the day of the (World War I) armistice 
he threw a letter in the mailbox to tell his parents when he is coming home and the mailbox 
exploded and killed him.  So my uncle and aunt just died of broken hearts, of TB.  And their 
daughter was very badly spoiled and through the Hitler time I don\'92t know what happened to 
them.  \par
}{\plain Uncle Emmanuel was also in Portland.  He died, his wife died and his sons died.  There were 
three uncles in Portland.  Sons were sent to America.  And the other sisters they all died.  Some 
of them I never knew.  Don\'92t know what my mother\'92s parents did for a living.  \par
}{\plain Ruth Turner is my first cousin and was born in Portland.\par
}{\plain Herta is from my father\'92s side.  Aunt Herta\'92s mother and my father were first cousins.  Herta\'92s 
mother\'92s maiden name was Winter and my father\'92s name was Winter.  My father\'92s father and 
Herta\'92s mother\'92s father were brothers.  And Gretl\'92s father was another brother of my grandfather.  
I don\'92t know how many brothers there were and there were two sisters also.  I was not too 
interested in some of the relatives.  When you are young, what do you care about such things?  \par
}{\plain We\'92re aren\'92t related at all to the Kalbermans.  No relation whatsoever.  My father\'92s mother.  No.  
Daddy\'92s mother\'92s...Uncle Max Frank. My (Actually Siegfried\'92s) father\'92s mother and Uncle Max 
were brother and sister and Uncle Max married Tanta\'92s (Mella Kalberman\'92s mother) sister, 
which is the Vineland family.  Lehman.  That\'92s pretty far.   \par
}{\plain There are some pictures of daddy.  You know, you wrote on them.  That\'92s our daddy.  The oldest 
was daddy.  That\'92s our daddy with his bicycle he was so proud of.  That was with his dog.  \par
}{\plain Cannot tell you about your father\'92s brothers and sisters.  Your father had one sister, Hedwig, who 
was married.  Had no children.  Father\'92s birthday October 16.  Mother\'92s was born in 1873.  
Could be.  And father was born in 1874.  He was a year younger.  Hermann Frank and Therese 
Frank.  Her maiden name was Frank.  They lived in Buttenwiesen.  In Bavaria.  The sister\'92s 
name was Hedwig.  She was born 1902 and the other brother\'92s name was Karl and he was born 
1904, Ernst was born 1907, and Ludwig 1912.  \par
}{\plain In Buttenwiesen Siegfried was also a butcher and cattle dealer.  He came to the United States in 
1939.  A cattle dealer was this.  They bought cattles and all depends.  If they had cattles for ... if 
they bought them for slaughter then they fat(ten) them up and then brought them to the cattle 
market auction.  If they had cattles which the people needed for milk or for er... and they sold 
them from one to another.  We bred cattles too.  They went to the auctions and bought what they 
needed.  If they had orders for cattles for pulling the wagons then they went to the auctions and 
tried to get them.  \par
}{\plain SF: People put orders in to them for what kind of cattles they needed?\par
}{\plain FF: That\'92s right.  And then they bought them and then sold them for profit.  Sometimes we bred 
some cattles.  There was a big, big cattle market that was a few days away.  He had to go a few 
days and then bring them home and then fatten them up and then bring them to the 
slaughterhouses.  That\'92s how they made the money. \par
}{\plain SF:  Any of father\'92s relatives?\par
}{\plain FF: The cousins Otto Frank and Walter Frank.  Their fathers were brothers.  They\'92re very old.  
Also the sister-in-law also is very old.  They live in New York.  They came to America the year 
you were born.  I went with her...she knew how to sew and wanted to make a living at it.  I went 
with her to those trade places.  I was already that big but I took her under my arm and I went 
with her.  We walked all over where the sewing places were.  You know, those sweatshops. \par
}{\plain Ruth: How did you meet Siegfried Frank?  \par
}{\plain FF:  Oh, boy.  Somebody, a very old lady, a friend of my parents who liked me a lot and 
whenever I from Munich home I stopped in that city which was called Nordlingen to visit that 
old woman because I really liked her.  And they came to America and they always asked me to 
come and visit them and finally one day I went there.  Daddy was very friendly with a couple 
from Buttenwiesen and they were cousins with those Lefiters and the Leiters.  The people I was 
friendly with (Leiters) and the people he was friendly with.  They called me up once and asked 
me to come at that and that time so I asked why.  They said they had a very good friend who 
would like to meet me, so I asked \'91what does he do?\'92  So they said he is a butcher so I had no 
time.  I had no time.  So then she said \'91when do you have time to come\'92 and I said \'91I don\'92t know 
I\'92m very busy.\'92 So one day she called me up and said \'93Look, you held us up long enough now.  
This is the best and nicest man you have ever met and you better come.  Butcher or shoemaker or 
whatever it is you better come.  You get down from your high horse and you better come.\'94  And 
so I went.  And daddy liked me right away.  I had a hat on and he didn\'92t like my hat.  I wore a 
hat.  He said he couldn\'92t understand how I could wear a hat....  I was 25.  \par
}{\plain Look at this picture.  It was when I was single.  \par
}{\plain SF: It says care of Eiseman on it.\par
}{\plain FF: That\'92s where I worked.\par
}{\plain SF: you worked for the Eisemans?\par
}{\plain FF: not for those.  For anyone, believe me.  \par
}{\plain And then he invited me a few times.  I was also going with another fella who was...who came 
from N\'fcrnberg.  I was very friendly with him.  Daddy wanted to go steady but I told him I had to 
go to Lake Placid where I worked and I have to find out first what I really want.  I liked the other 
fella better because he was better looking.  I got letters.  Daddy wrote to me and he wrote to me.  
That other guy, his name was Weil, wrote a letter to me and the envelope was addressed to me 
but the inside was addressed to a girl in Germany where he was going steady.  He wrote about 
me and some of things were absolutely untrue.  I couldn\'92t believe it.  Now I said to myself \'91you 
went long enough for the outside of the person, now you better go for the inside.\'92  Then I kept 
writing to daddy and he couldn\'92t understand the letters were so different.  They changed so.  I 
told him later.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Then that Beno (sp?) Weil was his name.  I figured I cannot write to him, I have to tell him.  So 
then when I came back and daddy picked me up at Grand Central Station and brought me flowers 
and then he said he was taking me out to eat.  Where do I want to go to eat?  I said in the 
delicatessen.  He was so relieved.  He figured because I worked for such rich people that I have 
such rich ideas, you know.  So we went there and we had a frankfurter and he was so grateful.  
He said to me \'91I though you have all those high ideas and this...\'92 and so that was it.  Then a week 
or two later I met that other fella and he came and had something in a box like a thing of beer or 
whatever it was and he wanted to give it to me and I said \'91you hold it Beno.  I don\'92t want to take 
a present from you.\'92  I liked his mother a lot and I told him what I found and we broke up right 
then and there.  I said I brought the letter back, I said \'91you put it in the wrong letter and said you 
wanted to send it to her so send it to her.\'92  In the meantime it was very bad and you couldn\'92t 
write anymore to Germany so that\'92s how I met daddy and what happened.  \par
}{\plain SF: What kind of pets did you have when you were growing up?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh, God.  Dogs and cats and sheep and a goat, lamb, you name it I had it. Oh I had such 
beautiful dogs.  I did. I had two dogs like this.  The little one died and I buried him and put a 
cross on his grave. My little one Ami and the other one was Leo and the other was Hans 
(laughter) and they were Saint Bernards.  They were so beautiful.  They shot them.  The Germans 
shot them when I was home.  \par
}{\plain I was so afraid to look at a horse I wouldn\'92t go into the stable.  I used to feed the cows. Those 
kind of things I loved to do but when the horse...  We had two horses, one for my father and 
one....  See in the Jewish religion you could never put a horse and a cow on a wagon to pull 
because a horse has more strength than a cow.  Only two horses or two cows. So when we had in 
the summer when we had to take home the hay and all those kind of things, we had two horses 
for this and in the winter we only had one.  That horse was so old but I wouldn\'92t go near it.  We 
had some nice cows.  We had little ones.  Sometimes 40 and sometimes 5, it all depends.  When I 
was a baby we had one for that purpose, for the milk, and when Bianca and her baby we had two.  
Always the steady one so the milk didn\'92t have to be...always the same milk.  We had little ones.  
My father bought once 50 little ones.  We had extra stables for a while to see them grow up.  You 
know bigger than calves.  They were beautiful.  I loved to work with them.  I loved to work with 
them.  But nothing in the house.  No cooking, no nothing. Boy\'92s work.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Our house was a nice house.  It was nice to those times you know.  You had a living room which 
was a dining room.  In the middle of the living room was a dining room table which you could 
pull out.  It was underneath.  You pulled it out.  We had everything there.  We had everything 
there.  We had a credenza, we had a buffet.  But every house had in the middle of the living room 
a table.  We had a beautiful stove.  A square, long table.  The table was a regular size and when 
we ate we pulled it out just like this and when we had company you pulled more out.  Could be 
pulled out and out.  We had beautiful flowers.  \par
}{\plain Next to the living room was a room which used to be my grandmother\'92s room.  When she died in 
1922, I was 10 years old, I remember that.  Then my father put his desk in and put his books in 
and a sewing machine in.  We made it just like that.  And then we had a kitchen with two big 
buffets.  A milchdich and a fleishdich.  And a stove and also a table and all those things.  No 
icebox. Next to the kitchen was what they called a \'91schpice\'92(sp?) was like a cool room.  It was 
very cold.  How it was so cold I don\'92t know because we had no ice.  It came from...it was built 
up from the cellars, see, and next to it, as big as this, we had what you called it your icebox but 
there was no ice in there.  A pantry.  It was very cold in there and I don\'92t know why.  \par
}{\plain Then we had the bedrooms.  On the same level we had my bedroom and then on the other side 
we had my sister\'92s bedroom and upstairs was my parent\'92s bedroom and another kitchen if you 
wanted to use the kitchen for two families.  You know my mother.  It was really built for two 
families.  We used it for storage, for storing things.  Then there was another room where we had 
the flour.  When you had so many people you made your own bread and you had the big bins in 
there.  White flour and dark flour.  All the things and corn and that kind of stuff in that so-called 
kitchen.  \par
}{\plain Then we had a room which was called the \'91gudes tzimmer (good room)\'94.  We had the piano in 
there, we had the red velvet sofa in there and red velvet chairs and a big table and the most 
beautiful buffet you have ever seen in your life.  I don\'92t know what ever happened to it.  Right 
now you ask me (what kind of piano) I couldn\'92t tell you. (Note: it was a Bechstein.)  It was like 
this and had two hands up like this.  There were like two handles which were put on there and it 
was an upright.  It was a beautiful piano but I never liked to play it.  It was on the second floor.  
Then we had another room where we had a laundry mangow(?) A mangow where you...after the 
wash dried you put it through that mangow.  We were the only one in the whole... not to dry it, 
you put it through like your sheets your things you didn\'92t have to iron (e.g. a wringer).  We were 
the only one to have that, no one else had that.  Then we went upstairs and there were the maids\'92 
rooms.  On the third floor.  Two maids rooms.  \par
}{\plain Bianca\'92s parents lived in Munich and Ruth\'92s parents lived in the same town as we did.  (Note: 
opposite of actual situation.) They had their own house.  I remember and I don\'92t (what their 
house was like.)  My father bought it from an old woman who had no children and nobody.  She 
died and when she died Ida\'92s mother moved in.  Ida\'92s mother was always renting a place you 
know.  So she moved in and had the downstairs which was a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen 
and also (a place) like where you kept your fruit and your stuff, you know.  My sister lived 
upstairs.  They had beautiful things.  When I think of the furniture she got when she got married 
my heart breaks still today.  Beautiful furniture, and they a kitchen and a living room.  One room 
was called a \'91spice tzimmer\'92 already. An extra room for dining.  With a buffet and....it was a 
beautiful, beautiful room.  They had such figurines and everything.  We had it home too.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain We had a pewter, a whole wall of pewter and we had beer steins, pewter beer steins, other beer 
steins.  Then my father never smoked but he collected some pipes and we had them hanging 
there and there were ebony pipes with silver things on them and we had beautiful silver.  Oh my 
parents had such beautiful silver, which only came out when company came. And dishes and all 
that stuff which you buy now...the stuff you bought...the bowls and things  ....pottery.  We had all 
that stuff for Passover.  We had tons.  Up in the roof was in boxes and written on there yontiff 
fleishdich and milchdich.  We had very beautiful furniture in the living room.  Very beautiful 
furniture.  We had upstairs that buffet, it was just beautiful.  (In the buffet was) good dishes all 
the porcelains, all good figurines..  The only thing I got from there were those pink little demi-tasse.  All those birds, all this here.  That\'92s why it means so much to mean.  The birds came from 
home.  I had so much I gave it away.  I needed wedding presents for the Hoffheimers so I gave 
them the crystal bowls and all those kind of things.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: What did the farm look like? How many barns did you have? \par
}{\plain FF: I tell you something, when I left it was a sad looking thing.  It was a very sad looking thing.  
We had no more cows.  We had no more...  They took the wagons out.  We were the only 
family.... See for transportation to the nearby cattle market my father had made like a truck 
which had to be pulled by two horses and he had this made.  Everything was taken away.  It was 
very sad. (Before) it looked like a very well kept farm, a very well kept farm.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 1.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SIDE 2\par
}{\plain We had two barns.  Two big barns.  We had hay wagons in there.  We had a cow wagon for 
transportation.  We had those wheel barrels.  Whatever you needed.  I don\'92t even know the name 
for all those kind of things.  One day we had 40 (cattle) and two days later we had 4 or 5.  We 
had one steady cow.  Oh boy, we had one steady cow.\par
}{\plain SF: Was cattle dealing the family business?\par
}{\plain FF: Ya, my father\'92s father was a cattle dealer and then he also dealed with leather.  Leather.  
Skins. Hides and leather.  And he did very well with it.  Sometimes my father, when they 
bothered him, so he says \'93ok, since he had this friend who had a leather factory so he used to say 
to him \'91oh, they bother me for so\'92.  He made good money on that too.\'92\'94\par
}{\plain In the Jewish community he was the president for many, many years.  For as long as I can 
remember. in the gentile community, he was everything but mayor.  He was on the school board, 
he was the other board, he was for the poor, he was everything, everywhere.  People used to 
come to us and brought complaints and he brought it up to the mayor and they had meetings and 
the school board they had meetings.  He was just the only Jewish man in town for all those kinds 
of things.  \par
}{\plain SF: So he was the main contact between the gentile and Jewish community?\par
}{\plain FF: He was president of the synagogue.  When I remembered there were maybe 15 families there 
and then less and less.  The children got married and moved away; the elderly people died and 
then later on everybody moved away.\par
}{\plain SF: What did the family do on a normal week?\par
}{\plain FF: The man went out to work and the woman was home and cooked and washed.  \par
}{\plain SF: Somewhere we got all those doilies.\par
}{\plain FF: They did this in the winter in the evening. Oh, yeah.  They were sitting there.  That was the 
right way of doing for a well brought up family, just I was the only one who rebelled against it.  I 
blamed my eyes. I used to sit like this and say \'91my eyes can\'92t see.\'92  \par
}{\plain SF: What did the family do for entertainment?\par
}{\plain FF: They came to visit each other. The grandchildren came.  They went to visit in the afternoons.  
\par
}{\plain SF: Did your father bring flowers home all the time?\par
}{\plain FF: No, we had the flowers right outside.\par
}{\plain SF: Did they read a lot of books?\par
}{\plain FF: Ya, oh ya.  Oh my God how I had to go to the library every so often.  The school library.  We 
had a lot of books at home.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did your parents have any special degrees or did your father just learn the trade?\par
}{\plain FF: No, my father went to high school when he was young.  Novels. Read all books.  Genevieve.  
That was one my mother read every year.  My father read books on everything.  \par
}{\plain Ruth: Who played the piano?  \par
}{\plain FF:   Your (Ruth\'92s) mother.  I played but I didn\'92t like to.  It went too slow for me.  They bought 
me a violin.  I started learning and then they told me only boys learn the violin so I broke it.  
Couldn\'92t play it. \par
}{\plain SF: There was a bearskin rug on the floor?\par
}{\plain FF: That wasn\'92t a bearskin.  It wasn\'92t a bearskin.  That was from one of our dogs.  I hid the key 
of the piano.  They didn\'92t know.  It was ....  What do you call it when the dog dies and then you 
skinned it and have it fixed.  There was one person who picked it up and did everything and they 
brought it back and it was laying like this but the head was up like that.  That wasn\'92t a dog you 
can pet.  They were dogs for the fields and the cows and for this.  Then we had that skin and I 
had the piano up there.  Then when our junior teacher taught me.  When my mother came up 
once he had his arm around me like this.  I was 15 or 16 and he was 18.  So my mother said from 
now on, when I get the lessons, she has to be there because she didn\'92t like that.  I said I wouldn\'92t 
do it.  If you be there, I\'92m not playing piano anymore.  So one day my mother came up and she 
sat there and did some whatever...crocheting, and I finished and no more.  I was very young then.  
So I took the key and threw it in the dog\'92s mouth and went down where you couldn\'92t see.  This 
room was only cleaned for Passover.  No one was ever in this room.  It was always locked.  So 
then you went and shook out the rug and the things and the key came out.  Then I told them what 
I did.  My mother said \'91we\'92re not going to spend money.  If you don\'92t want to play you don\'92t 
play\'94, so I never played. \par
}{\plain Ruth\'92s mother played.  They did everything my parents told them to do.  Especially Ruth\'92s 
mother.  She never said no.  They used to say \'93The oldest can never say no.\'94  The big ones never 
said that.  They did everything they were told  \par
}{\plain SF: What sports did you participate in?\par
}{\plain FF: At home, skiing, bicycle riding, runner in public school and all the school sports\'96in Munich, 
not home.  \par
}{\plain SF:  Where did you go skiing.\par
}{\plain FF: Home, in Munich, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Lenggries.  \par
}{\plain SF: How far was Switzerland?\par
}{\plain FF: From Munich, 3 and a half, four hours. From Wittelshofen to Munich was 5-6 hours by train. \par
}{\plain SF: Did others in the family participate in a lot of sports?\par
}{\plain FF: No, just me.  They were married already, and when you\'92re married you don\'92t do those kinds 
of things. \par
}{\plain SF: Didn\'92t an uncle skate with Sonya Henie?\par
}{\plain FF: Ya, you know that.  In Munich everybody went skiing.  You didn\'92t go skiing you were 
severely an outcast.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about my father\'92s family?\par
}{\plain FF: Your father\'92s family had a hard job making ends meet.  The only one who really made ends 
meet was your daddy.  His father retired with 42.  He had asthma and he had those boys.  You 
know the boys were supposed to support the parents.  He was a butcher.  But what he did...daddy 
made money and very hard earned money and he put it all into the house.  He built and built and 
built and daddy was promised a motorcycle and never got it.  His youngest brother I knew in 
Munich.  He went to high school there.  He went to trade school and as a kaufman 
(buyer/salesman).  I have his picture here.  He spent the money the way they made it.  He went 
out with girls like crazy.  I never went out with him because I didn\'92t like the girls he went out 
with.  \par
}{\plain Then he had two more brothers.  One was a baker.  I don\'92t know what the other one was.  I think 
Ernst was the baker and Ludwig was the salesman.  Karl, I don\'92t know what he was.  But the 
brothers were not that ambitious.  He was the most ambitious one.  That\'92s what the people told 
me from Buttenwiesen.  Everyone said he was the best of all.  And then he made the money so 
his sister could get married.  She got 10,000 marks when she got married.  SF:  He made money 
for her dowry.  \par
}{\plain FF: Ya.  There is another relative in New York.  I told you they are elderly people now.  That\'92s 
the sister\'92s sister-in-law.  She came to Buttenwiesen and she wanted to marry daddy.  So they 
said that if he would marry the sister-in-law he would get the 10,000 marks back but he didn\'92t 
like her.  She was a very nice person. Recha.  You must remember her.  She used to come to the 
house.  But he didn\'92t care for her, he always said.  So he had to marry out his sister for 10,000 
marks and the studies of his brother cost another 10,000 marks.  When it came to him. He did 
everything on bicycle. To get his  motorcycle then something else came up.  His father built and 
built and built and he never got it.  That\'92s why when he got the car here he felt he was king.  \par
}{\plain He was very active.  He was very sporty.  Football.  All kinds of sports.  He had muscles.\par
}{\plain Ruth: Like Popeye.\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, he had muscles.  Daddy and me, we walked and did exercise and we did everything.  
He was very sporty.  That\'92s what I liked.  After I got to know him, he was really my type of 
person.  \par
}{\plain SF:  Did you get any awards when you were young?\par
}{\plain FF:  I got a lot of awards.  I was the valedictorian but I got stuck in my speech.  I couldn\'92t finish 
the speech.  My parent\'92s nearly died.  Then I finished it.  I was choked up that I had to leave 
school.  So then I....yeah, I was pretty good in school I must say.  \par
}{\plain SF:  The state supported religious schools.  Did you go to public or religious school?  FF: I went 
to both a public school and a religious school.  We came home from public school and had to go 
for two hours to Hebrew school.  SF: My father did the same thing? FF:  I imagine.  That\'92s how 
we learned.  I went there (to public school) until I was 12 years and then I went to high school.  
They went to public school to 15 or 16 and then they went to another school there which was 
called Volkpilldenschul (sp?) but I never went there so I don\'92t know what they learned.  After 
they graduated public school they went every Saturday and Sunday to this same school but for 
different subjects.  I don\'92t know what they learned because I went away and I never knew....\par
}{\plain SF:  Did the family take any vacations?\par
}{\plain FF:  Yeah.  My parents sometimes took vacations.  My parents went once to Wiesbaden.  They 
had baths there for arthritis and that stuff and then they wanted to go and there was this Jewish 
family in town and the man was very bad arthritis ridden and then my father sent him.\par
}{\plain SF:  Did they ever go to another country?  FF:  No.\par
}{\plain SF: Did they go with the family or by themselves?  FF: They went by themselves but then they 
went to Munich but they only went separately to Munich because someone had to be home in the 
house.  You had animals.  You had cows, you had dogs, you had cats, you had maids.  So my 
father came and my father came (to Munich) and he wanted to stay a week and then he only 
stood three days and we wanted to know why.  So he said he goes up and down the street and 
nobody says \'93good morning, Herr Winter; good afternoon Herr Winter.\'94  He was very lonesome 
so he left.  And my mother wouldn\'92t go without my father.  \par
}{\plain SF: Couldn\'92t the people left behind run the farm.\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah, but not the cattle dealers.  The cattle dealers had to be there.  When a farmer called 
then they couldn\'92t do it and they wanted my father.\par
}{\plain SF: Didn\'92t you have to have someone who lived further away for when the fields were snowed 
in?\par
}{\plain FF:  No. Our man lived above the stables because when the snow was in someone had to feed the 
animals.  He had the room above the stables and fed them.  That happened quite often because 
sometimes we couldn\'92t open the shutters for days.  \par
}{\plain SF: Tell us about the neighbor whose chickens you got drunk. \par
}{\plain FF: It wasn\'92t a neighbor, it was an old woman down and around.  She lived in this house.  She 
didn\'92t like me because when I passed with the bicycle and she lived on the corner house I rang 
the bell like crazy on the bicycle and that drove her nuts.  I knew it drove her nuts so I started a 
long time before and kept ringing the bell.  So whenever something happened...  Once her 
window broke.  She called my father.  Not by telephone because we were the only Jewish people 
who had a telephone.  Then someone else got it.  She told my father I broke her window and 
when I came home my father said I have to come in.  He said \'93What did you do to Frau 
Pollock?\'94 I said \'93I didn\'92t do anything papa.\'94  He said \'93She says you broke her window.\'94 I said I 
wasn\'92t even there.  Ida was her love.  You know.  So I said \'93I wasn\'92t even there papa\'94 so my 
father said he was going to go out and tell her and he told her.  She said I did it anyway.  She said 
all she wanted to do was be paid so my father said \'91Have it fixed.  I pay you.\'94  My mother got 
very mad.  She said \'91You shouldn\'92t do that.\'94  He said \'91She is an old woman.  She has no 
children.  What are you going to do, fight with her?\'94  \par
}{\plain So whenever there was something...  When it rained, when it snowed, when the sun shined, it 
was always me.  So once she told the Hebrew teacher that she asked me a brucha, it was 
thundering and lightening and she said \'93Do you know the brucha for when it thunders and lights\'94 
and I said \'93I knew it but I forgot.\'94  So she told him and he gave me a good licking because I 
didn\'92t tell her the brucha so I really felt hurt.  Why is she riding around me all the time.  I bring 
her fruit.  I bring her cake and I\'92m so good to her and she just doesn\'92t like me.  So I figured I\'92m 
going to do something that hurts her the most.  I\'92m going to kill her chickens.  I went home and I 
had this blue apron on, I\'92ll never forget.  It had two pockets.  I took some schnaps.  One thing in 
our house I must say, nothing was ever locked.  Even where we had the money the key was in the 
thing.  Everything had a key.  I took a bottle of schnaps and I took some Berches and I put them 
in.  Instead of putting it in a bowl I put it in my pocket.  You know they were all soaked through.  
I put my hands in my pockets and I went down there and I went drup, drup, drup and all the 
drups came and I just threw this schnaps there.  The Berches with the... Whoever taught me 
this....no one ever taught me this. I made it up myself.  They all came and they drank like crazy.  
I stood there and they all went down and I thought this time she really got it.  I though they were 
killed already and I didn\'92t care a bit.  I went home.  \par
}{\plain After a while I run again and they were all lying together, all together like a real clique.  I didn\'92t 
say anything but my mother, I never forget, said to me \'93How come you\'92re home all afternoon.  
How come you\'92re not...\'94 because I was always running around.  I wanted to be home.  My father 
came home and I kissed him and my father came home and was standing on the door.  We took 
off his hat and we wiped his head with a handkerchief and one put the shoes on, the slippers on.  
All of sudden Frau Pollock comes running.  \'93Herr Winter, Herr Winter, Herr Winter, you gotta 
come home.  My chickens are dead.\'94  So my mother said \'93What happened\'94 because my father 
had connections with the veterinarian who treated the animals, you know.  So my father said \'93I 
come right away\'94 and my father run out and I run after him.  He went there and he sees the 
chickens.  It took a long time.  They were really drunk.  Then he came home and he took me by 
the hand and he says \'93this is sad, this is sad.\'94  She had those gray, those real gray and white hens.  
He says \'93That\'92s everything she had.  That\'92s really sad.  I wonder what happened.\'94  He\'92s going to 
speak to the veterinarian tomorrow.  \par
}{\plain So at night, after we were finished eating, I never forget, I stood on the door and I said \'93I know 
what happened to Frau Pollock\'92s hens.\'94  So my father said \'93What happened?\'94  \'93I made them 
drunk.  I don\'92t think they\'92re dead but I think I made them drunk.\'94  So my father said \'93You 
didn\'92t.\'94  My mother said \'93She wouldn\'92t say it unless she did.\'94  So they said \'93What did you do?\'94 
so I stood on the door.  I had the copper door handle in my hand in case they go after me, if my 
mother goes after me, I\'92m right out, you know.  So the whole everyone, the maid and everyone, 
they got hysterical.  So the man, our knecht(?) says \'93You\'92re right.  Because she does nothing but 
aggravating you and me too.\'94  He says \'93She doesn\'92t like us\'94 I said \'93I don\'92t think they\'92re dead 
because I saw them like this.\'94  So my father got up and says \'93I can\'92t believe it.  Who told you?  
Where did you get the schnaps? Where did you get the Berches.  How did you cut the Berches?\'94  
You know it was heavy to cut it.  I cut it.  My mother looked and it was really sawed off like this, 
not the way it was supposed to be.  Well they couldn\'92t get up from the table, they were 
hysterical.  \par
}{\plain So my father went out, he says to me \'93You have to come along and excuse yourself\'94 and I said 
\'93no I\'92m not.  I\'92m not.  She hurt me and she lied about me and she told the Hebrew teacher about 
me and it wasn\'92t true and I\'92m not gonna go\'94 and I wouldn\'92t go.  He went out and he says he 
wants to see what the chickens do and she was there crying with her hands in her apron and my 
father said \'93They look alright.\'94  She says they come to.  I don\'92t know what happened, I don\'92t 
know what happened.  He says \'93They\'92ll be alright.  They\'92ll be alright.\'94 And then he didn\'92t tell 
her.  Later on he told her.  He went out on a Saturday after the temple.  He went there and he told 
her what happened and he said to her why it happened.  He said \'93You leave this kid alone.  She 
doesn\'92t do any harm to you.  Everybody likes her and you are the only one who really does all 
this harm to her and she wanted to get back at you.\'94  He says \'93you know I don\'92t help unless its 
necessary but you leave her alone.\'94  She left me alone. \par
}{\plain  \par
}{\plain So when she died we were three girls: Ida, myself and Selma who is in England.  We were 
supposed to sit there in the wake, you know, because we had no funeral home.  I didn\'92t believe 
she was dead.  I said to them \'93I don\'92t think she\'92s dead.\'94  They said \'93She\'92s dead.\'94  So I said \'93I got 
to try and I took a ball and I bounced the ball back on her, where she was laying there dead, on 
that wall and when she didn\'92t move I said \'93she\'92s dead.\'94  \'93Now we have to sit quiet\'94 I said, \'93Now 
I know she\'92s dead.\'94  Because I used to throw the ball against the wall too and it annoyed her to 
death, you know.  I said \'93She\'92s dead.  We got to leave her alone.\'94  Then we sat real quiet.  Left 
her alone.  Ida was crying.  She said \'93you\'92re going to hit Frau Pollock\'94 and I said \'93I\'92m not hitting 
her but I don\'92t believe she\'92s dead.\'94  It was the first time I saw a dead person and it didn\'92t affect 
me at all.  \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: Did you do any work on the farm?\par
}{\plain FF: A lot.  I did everything.  I liked it.  I mowed the grass.  We had a machine where you drove 
around and this but there were corners where you couldn\'92t do so you had to have one of those 
long knives, we called it sense (sp?) and I did it.  Once I cut my finger all across.  Then we also 
had a hand one, a sickle, that\'92s called a sickle here too?  And I had to go in the corners.  I loved 
that work.  I would have been the best farmer.  I did everything on the farm.  Fed the cows, 
milked them. I learned to milk on a goat.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you ever deliver any baby animals?\par
}{\plain FF: No, I run away.  I couldn\'92t see this.  We had geese.  We didn\'92t have geese on our home.  We 
bought the geese and made them fat and then they were schlact(slaughtered).  \par
}{\plain FF: There was a pond in the gardens.  (To Ruth) Do you remember in the gardens where we had 
all this water coming through?  But I tell you, it was very hard.  We had a lot of water sometimes 
and it came all the way up but it couldn\'92t go up to our house because it was up on the hill, but a 
lot of people had water.  Bianca\'92s parents had water in their cellar many times.  Our house was 
Schloss 87B.  Our house called Schloss Hof.  That\'92s where it was.  \par
}{\plain SF: Whose castle was it built on?\par
}{\plain FF:  I forgot.  Would you believe it?  There were so many those Fursten, those people, those 
Pfalsgraff.  Uncle Leo knows a lot about them.  I don\'92t know anything about them.\par
}{\plain SF: Were there any family traditions that you had in particular? \par
}{\plain FF: The holidays.  Ya.  The holidays were always real family tradition.  Rosh Hashanah, Yom 
Kippur, Passover.  All the family came to us.  The Sabbath.  Birthdays we celebrated.  Chanukah 
we celebrated.  We were big on birthdays.  Not my father.  He left the house 5 in the morning.  
He didn\'92t want anything.....   Came Chanukah I had every Santa Claus chocolate from this size to 
this size.  Came Easter I had every bunny from this size to this size.  Passover and Easter never 
fell together.  If it did, then I didn\'92t have it.  But I had every Santa Claus there was.  We never 
made anything out of that.  \par
}{\plain SF: Your mother put out your clothes for your father?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  Handkerchief, tie, everything.  We tied our father\'92s shoes.  Then there came 
something new that they didn\'92t have to be tied. Came like with buckles.  He had such beautiful 
shoes.  In the winter they were inside with fur.  \par
}{\plain SF:  Why didn\'92t he do it?\par
}{\plain FF:  We were supposed to do it.  My father didn\'92t wear glasses.  He wore a zwicker (sp?).  He 
wore glasses with the thing here.  Pinched on the nose.  (A pince nez.) Shabbos it was gold and 
for every day it was silver.  \par
}{\plain (He normally wore) a suit.  A summer suit, black summer suit.  Dark blue or black. And a jacket.  
Never without a jacket.  (He always wore a jacket ) and a shirt.  My father never worked on the 
farm.  My father couldn\'92t put a nail in the wall if he wanted to.  \par
}{\plain SF: What did you normally wear?  Dirndls?\par
}{\plain FF: Yeah.  In winter I wore pants, ski pants and in summer I wore dirndls.  \par
}{\plain SF: Who were your best friends?\par
}{\plain FF: My girlfriend in England and Ida.  Selma and Ida and a gentile girl, a very good gentile girl.  
I understand....   Very good friends.\par
}{\plain SF: What about my father\'92s friends? FF: Yah.  He had beautiful gentile girlfriends.  He would 
have married a gentile girl if Hitler wouldn\'92t have come.  It didn\'92t bother him too much.  But he 
had nice Jewish girlfriends too and many times they wanted to marry him off and he didn\'92t.  He 
wanted someone sporty and full of the devil and he got it. (Chuckle) That\'92s what he told me.  I 
never forgot when his mother wrote \'93what you couldn\'92t find at home you found far away.\'94  \par
}{\plain When my mother came to Munich to visit, I used to say \'93momma, isn\'92t there anybody from your 
hometown you want to visit.\'94   She used to say \'93There are old people, there are \par
}{\plain very old people who live there.\'94  There were the Hamburgers who lived in our house (in 
Brooklyn), don\'92t you remember, on the top floor, and he was always with you when I wheeled 
you around and I used to feed him and used to give him candies.  His sons were as rich as can be.  
And then she said \'93There is only one family, and they don\'92t live to far from here, in 
Buttenwiesen.\'94 \par
}{\plain FF:  \'93What\'92s their name.\'94  Momma Winter: \'93Frank\'94 \par
}{\plain FF:  \'93Why don\'92t you ever visit them.\'94  Momma Winter  \'93They have a lot of children.  \par
}{\plain FF:  They weren\'92t \'91up to our expectations\'92 so she didn\'92t visit them.  So when I wrote.... Well, 
first of all I read in a letter my parent\'92s wrote to me last week (must be when FF re-read the 
letter) that my father knew daddy from the cattle markets.  From the auctions.  And daddy knew 
my father.  When I wrote to them, my mother was so excited you know, that I am away and 
found somebody so to speak from home.  They were so happy, they just couldn\'92t believe it.  At 
home they would have never allowed me.  At home I was engaged and not-engaged (to a doctor).  
Well I went steady for three years.\par
}{\plain SF:  Do you have any other stories from your childhood?\par
}{\plain FF:  I don\'92t know, I might have but I don\'92t remember right now.  \par
}{\plain SF: How about my father\'92s?  \par
}{\plain FF: Daddy had a lot of good memories.  Daddy came from a good town where there were a lot of 
decent people and he had help from a gentile man to come out.  They were very good to him.  
Very, very much nicer people than where I come from.  He had to work from when he was 12 or 
13 years old.  He had a hard life.  He never had vacation or anything like that.  He sent 
everybody else but not himself.  His mother would do anything for him.  When I was pregnant he 
wanted to wash the floors. I said \'93Why should you wash the floors?\'94  He said \'93I used to do it for 
my mother.\'94  I said \'93Well, you\'92re not doing it for me.\'94  He did everything for his mother.  He 
was very good to his mother.  Very good to his mother.  See, when you\'92re good to your mother, 
you\'92re good to your wife.  I think I\'92ll put the air conditioning on.  \par
}{\plain Ruth: That definitely is true.  \par
}{\plain SF: Do you remember your sister\'92s weddings at all?\par
}{\plain FF: Yah.  I remember my oldest sister\'92s wedding first.  It was such a big spiel.  It was a wedding 
in a hotel and I was six years old.  I think I must have been eight years old.  I was born in 1912 
and my sister got married in 1920.  I was eight years old.  It was such a big wedding and such a 
clamorous thing that I said to my mother when I was eight years old that would never happen to 
me.  I had to say a speech.  I had two pigeons in my hand.  They were made out of paper mache.  
I had to make a whole poem I had to say.  Ida had to say something too. I didn\'92t want to do it.  I 
never liked that, but I had to do it.  There was a big dinner and we stood in this hotel.  It was a 
big to do.  Ruth\'92s mother wanted to be married at home in our house, and it was in the winter.  In 
February or whatever, in the snow.  It was so beautiful.  We were taken to the temple where the 
ceremony was in the coach with the two horses and it was a beautiful ceremony.  It was really.... 
Ida\'92s mother cooked the meal.  We had ducks.  That was a delicacy you know.  It was really 
beautiful...-----phone rings and Ruth goes to answer.\par
}{\plain SF: Was Sigbert bar mitzvahed?  \par
}{\plain FF: Yah, I don\'92t remember that anymore, would you believe it.  I don\'92t remember it.  Many 
times I think of it and I can\'92t remember it.  I don\'92t know why.  Maybe I don\'92t want to, but I can\'92t 
remember it.  It hurts me very much to think about him.  It really does because he was like a 
brother.  He was the last person I saw when I left Germany because he came on the train.  See 
when I went into Paris, to France, and where he was in Karlsruhe was the last station in Germany 
when I knew that my trunks didn\'92t come through.  I saw them being disconnected.  He was the 
last person I saw and it hurts me really bad.  \par
}{\plain SF: Tell me about some of the things in the house like where did the picture of the old man....\par
}{\plain FF: This here?  I got this as a present.  I got this from a professor in school.  (He gave it to me) 
because he liked me.  When I graduated he gave it to me.  From High School.  Yah.  Dr. Zeigler. \par
}{\plain  \par
}{\plain SF: Where did the scarf from the Franco-Prussian war come from?\par
}{\plain FF: There were people living just.... we went out of the house just like here, a little further apart 
between this and the neighbor here.  They had no children.  They were the ones who spoiled me 
to no end.  They had an old mother and that old mother loved me to no end.  To no end.  See I 
was the youngest.  The big ones had gone already.  They gave me everything they could.  You 
know that old silver thing there is from home too, that silver basket.  (SF=What old silver 
basket?)  And all those beckers.  SF description--Rings come out from the middle with a flower 
in the middle.  FF: That\'92s yours.  SF: Was that your parents\'92?  FF: Yah, they used it for Pesach.  
For fruit.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain SF: This family lived next door to you.\par
}{\plain FF: There was this old woman who really loved me, she was hunchbacked, and I loved her.  And 
she gave me things and she gave me this and she said to me \'93This is my oldest, best possession.\'94  
She got it either from her husband or I don\'92t know from whom, who brought it to her.  She says 
\'93I\'92m giving it to you.  Promise me you never give it away.  That\'92s yours.  That\'92s yours.  That\'92s 
all I can give you.\'94  She gave me money too.  She opened a bank account for me.  She says \'93I 
want you to have that\'94 and then she gave it to me.  \par
}{\plain SF: She gave it to you when you were ready to leave Germany?\par
}{\plain FF: No, she died long before.  She gave it to me before, when she was old and sick.  She called 
me in and said \'93that\'92s for you.\'94 She gave me that.  She only had a daughter and a son-in-law.  
They knew.  They were right there.  Rosa was right there when she gave it to me.  Nisset Elkin 
(was her name).  Elkin was her last name.  Elkan.  \par
}{\plain SF: Where did the little girl with the apple in her hand come from?  \par
}{\plain FF: My mother.  See they are all things from home.  My mother bought it for me when I went 
away to school and said that\'92s the way I should be.  Nice and quiet and polite.  I wanted to 
become like this but it wasn\'92t in my genes.  They wanted to hold me down with anything and 
never made it.  \par
}{\plain SF: Did you have any early idols, people you looked up to?\par
}{\plain FF: Like my teachers.  The young teacher I liked.  I liked a lot of boys. Like a young girl does. I 
never saw a movie home.  The first movie I saw when I came away to school and I thought the 
best seat is in front and I had to sit in front like this and I nearly broke my neck.  \par
}{\plain SF: Was there a paper in town?\par
}{\plain FF: Oh, yeah, we had a few papers.  We had the N\'fcrnberger Zeitung (newspaper), we had the 
Frankfurter Zeitung, and we had the W\'f6rnitz Boden.  W\'f6rnitz that was the flood, the lake, yah, 
flu\'df \par
}{\plain (flooss), what\'92s a flu\'df?  A river went through.  \par
}{\plain SF: But there wasn\'92t anything in town.  How many people were in Wittelshofen?\par
}{\plain FF: 700.  (Note: probably closer to 200, certainly about 200 now).  I always said a thousand 
because I really didn\'92t want to say something.  About 15 or 20 Jews (not families, people).  I told 
you all the young ones were gone.  There were just five families.  There was us, the 
Weinschenks, and the Oberdorfers and the Gallingers and the Eisens.  Five families.  That\'92s all 
there was when I left.  (Nearby towns) had a bigger Jewish population.  Some of them had a big 
Jewish population.  \par
}{\plain SF: Why did you father settle in Wittelshofen?\par
}{\plain FF: His parents and his grandparents.  That was used to be 60, 70 (Jewish) families there.  They 
had their own temple and everything.  People died and the young ones went away to school and 
learned something and settled somewhere else.  They had families.  Some young ones married in 
town and they couldn\'92t make a good living so they moved to the city.  Same thing was happening 
then as is happening now.  I think we did enough for today.  \par
}{\plain Leo: Same thing by us too.  15 families.  But they all moved away too.  Gross Eichelsheim.  And 
then there was Klein Eichelsheim was close.  It was half as big.  There was Jewish people there 
too.  It is in Baden between Mannheim and W\'fcrzburg.  If you know where this is.  In Odenwald.  \par
}{\plain SF: You didn\'92t know my father in Germany?\par
}{\plain LK: I only heard from your father from a cousin, from der Lehman.  \par
}{\plain FF: We eat dinner in the house.  And then your (Ruth\'92s) uncle was sitting next to me and he 
offered me a cigarette.  I was pretty young and I didn\'92t want to say no and I really wanted to 
know what a cigarette tasted like.  So he gave me a cigarette and I took it and my mother got up 
from the table and gave me one look, like this..., and I put that cigarette down and never touched 
a cigarette ever.  Never.  Then my mother said to me (I didn\'92t want to say no) she says \'93Look, a 
fine girl does not smoke. I don\'92t care who hands it to her.  If it is a doctor or the mayor or 
whoever it is, I don\'92t want you to smoke\'94 and I never smoked.  She how you listen.  \par
}{\plain Then your parents went to honeymoon.  I went with your mother who bought a creptescine (sp?) 
nightgown.  It was so beautiful.  Oh, it was so beautiful.  I used to say \'93What do you need such a 
thing for.\'94  So she said she wanted a creptescine nightgown.  My oldest sister went and got 
married, Bianca\'92s mother.  They asked her what she wants best before she got married.  So she 
said she wants me to sleep with her before she gets married, the last two nights.  She loved me 
like a mother.  So I slept with her for two nights and she had to bribe me with chocolate and 
everything under the sun, otherwise I wouldn\'92t do it.  That was your parents.  Then they moved 
to Munich and then they had this apartment and they fixed it up with a big bay and everything, 
and that was it.  That\'92s enough now.  I don\'92t want any more.  It should be enough.  }}
