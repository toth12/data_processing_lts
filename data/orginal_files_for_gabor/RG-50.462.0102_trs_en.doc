\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab JF:  This is an interview with Mr. Herbert Broh in Philadelphia at the reunion of the Shanghailanders in October of 1999.  Mr. Broh, can you tell us where and when you were born, and a little bit about your family.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, sure.  I was born in Berlin, Germany in 1930 and my family lived in Berlin most of their lives.  My dad was born in Frankfurt and my mother was born in Dresden, Germany but we lived in Berlin.  And\'85 [sounds as though tape stopped].

\par \tab JF:  Can you tell me your mother's maiden name?
\par \tab HB:  My mother's maiden name was Pinkus, P-I-N-K-U-S\'85
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  \'85And they were--my grandparents--well, my grandmother, was sent to Auschwitz but my grandfather died of natural causes.
\par \tab JF:  This is your mother's\'85
\par \tab HB:  My mother's mother.
\par \tab JF:  On your mother's side?
\par \tab HB:   Yeah.  But my parent's parents, my father's parents did pass away previous\endash in the 20's, late 20's.  
\par \tab JF:  What kind of work did your father do?
\par \tab HB:  My father was working for a recycle, so to speak, not a recycling place but rebuilt machinery; in other words, they'd take old machinery and they rebuilt it and then they'd sell it.  So he was more or less a salesman for this company as my me
mory recollects--the name was Kohls, K-O-H-L-S, and also a Jewish firm, and, like I said, my dad was a salesman for those people.  Reconditioned machinery, that's what it was.  Reconditioned machinery, and later, and when people had to give up their busin
esses before the Crystal Night, Mr. Kohls was also being relieved by so called Aryan individuals, so he can run the business.  But my father was still employed with this firm until he migrated to Shanghai.  
\par \tab JF:  So he was able to earn a living during that time\'85
\par \tab HB:  He was earn\endash yeah, he was able to earn a living and during the time of the Crystal Night or the Germans call it }{\i\fs24 Kristall }{\fs24 Night, }{\i\fs24 Nacht}{\fs24 --}{\i\fs24 Kristallnacht}{\fs24 
, he at that time, they were gathering male, all males--not all males but certain males at rando
m and they were sent through the first phase of concentration camps, forced labor.  But my father somehow escaped that and he went to relatives in Dresden, where my mother was born, and he hid there until this was over and they never picked him up.
\par \tab JF:  How did he know to escape or had he been warned?
\par \tab HB:  I cannot recall that, but I remember, I was a child of eight, yeah, 1938 that was the }{\i\fs24 Kristallnacht.}{\fs24   I really don't know.  He had a probably a hunch that--he heard maybe, I think he heard of others.  H
e had a lot of gentile friends and they were telling them that, "You better watch out, Max".  His first name was Max.  "You better do something. Hide somewhere."  That's the way I recollect and\'85 
\par \tab JF:  That something\'85
\par \tab HB:  Because they were pick--they knew, his gentile friends knew that they were picking up men for forced labor.
\par \tab JF:  And they knew this after }{\i\fs24 Kristallnacht }{\fs24 had already happened or as\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, no, this was before }{\i\fs24 Kristallnacht.
\par }{\fs24 \tab JF:  Before }{\i\fs24 Kristallnacht.
\par }{\fs24 \tab HB:  Before, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Ok\'85
\par \tab HB:  Because I remember, I was a child, I didn't know where my father was going.  He was going on a trip.  I thought he was going on a business trip...
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  You see.  But actually in reality he was escape this phase of the, well it was a phase of first type of concentration camp.
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember }{\i\fs24 Kristallnacht }{\fs24 for\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah\'85
\par \tab JF:  \'85yourself?
\par \tab HB:  Of course.
\par \tab JF:  Can you describe it?
\par \tab HB:  I was seven years old when they, I was going to a public school in Germany, Berlin, Germany.
\par \tab JF:  Umm hmmm.
\par \tab HB:  And I was the only Jew in the classroom.  And I'll tell you, I was seven years old and they kicked me out because I was Jewish and I was transferred to a parochial school.  The parochial school was in the back of a synagogue.  And\'85
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember which one?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, it's the Rieckestrasse, the Rieckestrasse Synagogue, and I was, it was a combination of religious school and parochial school.  Well, it was a parochial school, and at the time of Crystal Night, we weren't--I wasn't goin
g to school, that was the night before.  The day before, we had school and then I came back.  They went home.  That same night, I remember when they were smashing, the Nazi's were smashing all the Jewish shops and for these derogatory remarks for the Jews
, Jews, Jews and\'85
\par \tab JF:  Where were you when you witnessed this?
\par \tab HB:  I didn't actually see the smashing of the glass but I've seen the demolished after, when I, the next day when I went to school.
\par \tab JF:  Did you hear anything from your home?  Could you\'85
\par \tab HB:  I, No, no\'85
\par \tab JF:  \'85hear sounds?
\par \tab HB:  We were living in the suburbs, so we weren't.  We were away from business establishments.
\par \tab JF:  So you did not know that there was\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, I did not know really, but the day that I went to school, the next day\'85
\par \tab JF:  Right.
\par \tab HB:  That's the, that's the thing.  The day that I went to school, I passed shops that were demolished and \'85
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember how you felt?
\par \tab HB:  I don't know how I felt.  I felt numb.  I, because there were some previous 
incidents, I used to play, where there was a park close by where we lived.  It's called, it was called the Friedeichshain Park and I used to go and, by myself.  I had a buddy that was not Jewish.  He lived in the same apartment building.  See we didn't ha
v
e these, in those days hardly anybody had houses.  We only, we lived in apartment buildings, and all of a sudden people, hordes of kids, threw stones at me and called me "Jew, Jew!"  And, of course, that discouraged me from going to the--that was very hur
t
ful--because you know, I didn't know really the concept of why, why, you know--Jew, you know.  I didn't know the concept of why they were throwing stones at me, and I don't think those kids knew why they were throwing stones at me, because their parents p
robably threw stones at me.  I mean, they told them to, about Jew, they're devils, and, as a matter of fact\'85
\par \tab JF:  You don't think the kids knew what they were doing really?
\par \tab HB:  I don't think so. I don't think so.  They were my age, eight years old, maybe
 seven, eight years old.  I remember we took a field trip when I went, before they kicked me out of the public school.  We were on a field trip and--it's funny how you remember, and I still have a school picture, which I don't have with me, of the school 
w
here I went to, of the public school, and we went--we passed a Jewish cemetery, and I remember vividly when our teacher said, we made a detour around the cemetery.  We didn't go past the cemetery because he mentioned that this is the devil's--the devil ro
ams in these grounds.
\par \tab JF:  Your teacher said that?
\par \tab HB:  My teacher.  The devil roams in these grounds.  I didn't know what he meant.  I had no conception--know what he meant and, of course, then a couple months later, I was kicked out anyway.
\par \tab JF:  Had this teacher ever treated you differently?
\par \tab HB:  No, no, he didn't.  
\par \tab JF:  He knew you were Jewish?
\par \tab HB:  Umm hmmm.
\par \tab JF:  And had you, before this time--before this attack in the park\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85 had you experienced any kind of\'85
\par \tab HB:  Not really.  No.  I really didn't.  No.
\par \tab JF:  \'85discrimination?
\par \tab HB:  But I was so innocent, so na}{\f28\fs24 \'56}{\fs24 ve about these things.  As a matter of fact, they gave out these little pamphlets of Hitler, and I was, in my mind, oh my, I wish I could join the Hitler Youth.
\par \tab JF:  Ah.  Did you get one, too?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were distributed on the street, I mean they were, you know, and really I--you know, funny when asked you interview me, I, this, it comes back to me and, of course, before I was being--before I realized t
hat they were throwing stones at me in the park.  That was before that.  I really thought it would be nice to join Hitler.  I used to play with German soldiers, you know these little figurines.  They looked just like\'85
\par \tab JF:  The little toy soldiers.
\par \tab HB:  Toy soldiers, toy soldiers.  Of course, I had a Mercedes Benz, I guess.  That's what Hitler drove around in.  That open Mercedes Benz.  I had that.
\par \tab JF:  You mean a toy.
\par \tab HB:  A toy, a Mercedes Benz.  Where you know, a figure, an image of Hitler was--and SS troops you know.  I played with those.
\par \tab JF:  You had these toys\'85
\par \tab HB:  I had these toys.
\par \tab JF:  With an image of Hitler in\'85
\par \tab HB:  An image of Hitler and an image of these SS troops and SA troops and what have you.  And I was six years--I was seven years old.
\par \tab JF:  These were the miniature--Were they iron or\'85
\par \tab HB:  They were\'85
\par \tab JF:  Or rubber?
\par \tab HB: What was it?  What are they made of, like clay or not clay, it would break easy but\'85
\par \tab JF:  They would break.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, probably iron.  Probably iron, yeah.  I don't know what happened to them.  
\par \tab JF:  Did your family know that you were playing with these?
\par \tab HB:  Sure they did.
\par \tab JF:  Did they say anything.
\par \tab HB:  No, nothing until--No, I didn't, no, no not at my recollection.
\par \tab JF:  Did they\'85
\par \tab HB:  But then, like I said when I was seven, that was 1937.  You figure 1937, we never thought it was--it would came to the Crystal like in Crystal Night and\'85
\par \tab JF:  Did you have a sense of before then, that your parents were concerned about Hitler coming to power?  That they were being affected?
\par \tab HB:  Not really.  Only I was concerned about that night, the Crystal Night and I didn't finish, actually as I was after\'85
\par \tab JF:  No, please.
\par \tab HB:  The way it happened, I went to school.  
Now that's when I really realized what was happening.  I was going to school and, like I said, the synagogue was in, behind the school and the courtyard.  So I visualize the courtyard and I seen the books and }{\i\fs24 Torahs}{\fs24 
 being in the middle of the courtyard, and the caretaker, he was not Jewish, he had a bloody face and, of course, there was no school, like I said.  And that visualize and I never will forget that.  The }{\i\fs24 Torahs}{\fs24 
 were on the courtyard.  They weren't burned yet, but they were intending to burn.  So I
 just went home right away and so then I realized that, and then, of course, at that time, my dad was in Dresden because he knew or he had the, what's it called hindsight?
\par \tab JF:  He had foresight.
\par \tab HB:  Foresight, I got mixed up.
\par \tab JF:  [laughter]
\par \tab HB:  He had his foresight that something is going to happen and\'85
\par \tab JF:  How did it feel when you saw the }{\i\fs24 Torahs}{\fs24  in the courtyard?  What was that feeling before you left, turned around and left?
\par \tab HB:  The feeling, I really didn't have a feeling at that time because I didn't know the concept of the }{\i\fs24 Torah}{\fs24 , per se.  We didn't really study the }{\i\fs24 Torah}{\fs24 
 or the--now, I afterwards, in China that where we really went into it--the }{\i\fs24 Torah}{\fs24 .}{\b\fs24   }{\fs24 
\par \tab JF:  Was your family observant in anyway?
\par \tab HB:  No, not too, no, not too observant.  My dad did do the Friday night }{\i\fs24 Kiddush}{\fs24 .  That's about it, but I never, no, no we weren't observant\'85
\par \tab JF:  But you had a sense that these were holy books?
\par \tab HB:  I had a sense that they were holy books, and I could not understand why they were thrown in the court
yard.  I didn't have no conception why, why, you know?  And until I was, like I said, I was eight years old then and finally--and why was this caretaker being injured, you know?  I didn't have no, I, no conception at all, no conception at all.
\par \tab JF:  When you went home, what happened?
\par \tab HB:  I went home and my--you know something, it's kind of a blank because I was with disbelief that something like this can happen, I mean disbelief.   And then I stayed home, I guess until--I never went back to that school ag
ain.  Never went back to that school until we migrated to China.  There was--it was shortly.  My dad had, and anyway, my dad came back after it cooled down and I...
\par \tab JF:  Were you worried about where he was at that point?
\par \tab HB:  No, I thought he was on a business trip, but then it was, I was told to me later.  They didn't tell me to keep, they didn't want to worry me too much, so they--you know it kind of reminded me, funny--it kind of reminded me of this movie}{
\i\fs24  Life is Beautiful}{\fs24 , did you see that?
\par \tab JF:  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  And like I say, I, they made it so that everything is going to be ok.  You know everything is no problems, you know.  We'll go to it, try different places, to beautiful places.  We go to Shangri-La, whatever and a\'85
\par \tab JF:  So that's how your parents\'85
\par \tab 
HB:  They believed that--as a matter of fact, my dad had an opportunity to go to South America.  He had two opportunities, so that visa somehow did not come through yet, so they didn't want to wait.  They didn't want to take any chances and Shanghai--well
 my uncle had, he was in the textile business in Germany.  And he had a little money, and he helped my dad with a fare to come to China at that time, so, but South America never materialized.
\par \tab JF:  And the South American plan was the only other plan that you know that your father might have pursued?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah, it was Brazil, Brazil, as a matter of fact, he--Brazil or Bolivia.  Now I'm not quite sure.  One of these.   Because I remember an uncle of mine went to Bolivia, [unclear].  That's, I think it 
was Bolivia, because in Brazil they speak Portuguese.  And I still have a Spanish-German dictionary at home.  So it must have been Bolivia. It must have been Bolivia.
\par \tab JF:  And when you got home, your mother was there?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, as I can recollect.
\par \tab JF:  Did she explain anything to you?
\par \tab HB:  Not really.  No, that's what\'85
\par \tab JF:  At that point?  They really were protecting you.
\par \tab HB:  Protecting me, exactly.
\par \tab JF:  And it worked.
\par \tab HB:  And it worked.  With this kind of a mentality, we left China, with this kind of an attitude, so to speak.  I had a ball.  I mean my mother, I mean the anxiety of my parents, you see we had to cross, we left Germany, we...
\par \tab JF:  When did you leave?
\par \tab HB:  We left Germany April of 1939.  As a matter of fact it was the day of Hitler's birthday.  
\par \tab JF:  April 20}{\fs24\super th}{\fs24 ?
\par \tab HB:  No, April, I don't know what date it was, April, I think I have my dad's passport.  I think it might be--and we had to cross Switzerland, we had to cross the Swiss-German border.  Brenner, have you ever heard of that?
\par \tab JF:  The Brenner Pass.
\par \tab HB:  The Brenner Pass.  And my mother--they were, they took a certain amount of jewelry with them and she was scared.
\par \tab JF:  How were you traveling?
\par \tab HB:  By rail.  By rail and, like I say, I as a kid had a ball.
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember any difficulty in\'85
\par \tab HB:  No I didn't\'85
\par \tab JF:  \'85in leaving?
\par \tab HB:  No, no difficulty.  When I went with my mother to get all these permits and visas and, from the German consulate.  I went with my mother, and my mother never looked Jewish per se.  So when 
I went with my mother, they took her first because they thought she was not Jewish.  She was Jewish\'85
\par \tab JF:  They thought she was German and not Jewish.
\par \tab HB:  Exactly, and I, funny I remember that, and then I, later on I when she told me that they took her b
ecause she did not look I know--what is Jewish looking, I mean what is Jewish looking I mean, now a days it's kind of ridiculous, you know.  But somehow you have this instinct of a refugee has a certain mannerism that you can just guess.  Later on I can t
ell you a story where my guess was right, and they were refugees in California that I met.  Their daughter I met here.  It was a bizarre story.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Ah.
\par \tab JF:  So here you are on the train, with your parents?
\par \tab HB:  With my parents going through the Brenner Pass\'85
\par \tab JF:  Any brothers or sisters?
\par \tab HB:  No, no I was the only one.
\par \tab JF:  And your grandparents?
\par \tab HB:  My grandparents, unfortunately, stayed behind, and they tried very hard to also get them out of there.  
See, you had them, the way I remember, they had an amount of business people and they arranged these trips.  If you didn't have any money, you lost.
\par \tab JF:  So you didn't, there wasn't family money to get your\'85
\par \tab HB:  There was, if you had money, sure there was family, but there were certain people.  You know, anybody that had a chance to get out of Germany, could get out.
\par \tab JF:  To?
\par \tab HB:  To wherever they wanted to go.  At that time, of course, Shanghai was the only open port.
\par \tab JF:  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, so but you still have to have a certain amount of money to get out of Germany.
\par \tab JF:  So the fact that your grandparents didn't get out was a financial one?
\par \tab HB:  No, it's just\'85
\par \tab JF:  Is that what you're saying?
\par \tab HB:  \'85well, I don't know.  I really couldn't say but they were so close and yet so far away, when we were in Shanghai to get them out.  My dad, my, like I said, my grandfather died of natural causes; then my grandmother somehow did\'85
\par \tab JF:  She was deported.
\par \tab HB:  She was deported later on.  Where?  We don't know.  I assume it was Auschwitz, but where we don't know.
\par \tab JF:  When did you find that out?
\par \tab HB:  Well, after the war.
\par \tab JF:  After the war.
\par \tab HB:  After the war.  Sure because they, my parents corresponded with my grandmother.  It had to be proofread by German authorities, all letters that came went out of Germany.\tab 
\par \tab JF:  Right.
\par \tab HB: Yeah, and they found out after the war.  There's no trace of her.  No trace.
\par \tab JF:  So the train ride--Let's\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85not lose the journey\'85
\par \tab HB:  Ok, sure.
\par \tab JF:  \'85was exciting.
\par \tab HB:  To me it was.
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.  Not for my parents because they were full of anxiety.
\par \tab JF:  Could you feel their anxiety?
\par \tab HB:  Not really.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  I was so enthused about being on this train, and whenever I smell, what i
s it they put on these, tar.  Whenever I smell tar, you go to any railway, when I--it kind of reminds me of my childhood.  That's when I travel, and, yeah, no, it was a pleasant\'85
\par \tab JF:  It's a pleasant\'85
\par \tab HB:   A pleasant journey for me.  To me it was.  It was not a pleasant journey for my parents.
\par \tab JF:  When\'85
\par \tab HB:  But the anxiety of whether we were going to get through or not.  See, they were afraid that something might go sour and then they might have to be deported back or something.  But thank G-d\'85
\par \tab JF:  When you talk about your parent's anxiety, when do you think you became aware of that?  Of their anxiety, of what their concerns were?
\par \tab HB:  Their anxiety?  
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  I never really, I never felt that--I knew that they were afterwards, after the fact.
\par \tab JF:  After the fact?
\par \tab HB:  After the fact, you know, after the war.
\par \tab JF:  After the war.  As you look back.
\par \tab HB:  As I look back.  There are certain things that my mother told me.  
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  That I, that I know that they had to live full of anxiety even during the Shanghai ghetto.
\par \tab JF:  But they were able to keep you optimistic during that time?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, oh yeah, definitely.  I would say, I would even say, as far as I was concerned, that these were my best years of my life in, living in Shanghai, because I went to school, Shanghai Jewish Youth Association School, or Kadoorie School\'85

\par \tab JF:  The Kadoorie School?
\par \tab HB:  \'85And it was before the war.  It was heaven for us.  Of course the, the living standards were not up to par.
\par \tab JF:  Let's, before we get to\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yes.
\par \tab JF:  Before we get to Shanghai\'85
\par \tab HB:  Ok, we are, we're still on the train\'85
\par \tab JF:  Let's talk about the train and make sure that we have all of these memories about that\'85
\par \tab HB:  Ok, the train.  We luckily--we passed the Brenner's Pass.  Then we went through Italy and we ended up in Rome.  And from Rome, I remember we took the train to Naples.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  And from Naples we boarded a shi--a combination passenger and freighter, a Japanese passenger and freighter--the }{\i\fs24 Kaptori Mare}{\fs24  and that took us to Shanghai.
\par \tab JF:  Did it go directly to Shanghai?  Did it make stops?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, it's no, no, no, it stopped in Bombay, and it stopped--it was a freighter.  It took about four weeks from Naples to get to China.
\par \tab JF:  Can you, I would love if you could describe that trip for me.
\par \tab HB:  Oh that trip to me was like heaven.  We were third class.  See we had, it was a class, First Class, Second Class, Third Class.  So we were Third Class
.  The only time, the only, what I remember the Second Class had a party.  We were invited for this party.  I don't know what kind of party, probably a cocktail party, whatever it was.  It had Japanese waiters.  Second--I mean people were traveling in sty
le.  They were not traveling they weren't traveling like refugees.  They were traveling in style.
\par \tab JF:  Were the people all refugees?
\par \tab HB:  All refugees.  All from Germany.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.  All German refugees.
\par \tab HB:  Well, yeah that's, to my collection, yeah.  And Austria, to Austria.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Austria and Germany.  And I remember I was sitting at the edge of the,  where the, and I watched the entertainment.  I was jealous, why can't we be there.  We were Third Class.  We were down a hole, you know, so to sp
eak and by the, at the portholes, you know?  And the Second Class they had very nice state rooms\'85
\par \tab JF:  Oh my.
\par \tab HB:  \'85And we had to share bunk beds.  The women were separate and the men were separate.  Not the Second Class.  They were you know, men and women were together.
\par \tab JF:  So you weren't in and just with your family?  You were\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, oh, we were, well, my mother and women were in a separate cabin.  You know, they have these wooden bunk beds.  And as a matter of fact, one of the fellows--one of o
ur passengers left the porthole open and water just shhhhish came down to--I was soaking wet and my dad, I guess he got mad and he had a few words with this individual who left the porthole open.
\par \tab JF:  So you were with your father?
\par \tab HB:  I was with my father.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  And another fellow, Dr., he was a medical doctor, Dr. Wolff.  He was, I, funny I remember him and a\'85
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember his first name?
\par \tab HB:  No.  Dr. Wolff and he gave me in, well that was later.  All the diseases that was, that was
 meant, I mean that we were, we got in China--I had from malaria to typhus to typhoid and what have you, but mild, because we were inoculated, you see.  We were inoculated.
\par \tab JF:  Now before you were on the boat, was their any attempt to inoculate you?  Or was there\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, well we were inoculated in Germany, as I remember, you know for\'85
\par \tab JF:  Before the\'85
\par \tab HB:  For smallpox, yeah sure.
\par \tab JF:  Now was this part of the regular regimen, or was this because of the trip?
\par \tab HB:  Because of the trip.
\par \tab JF:  So you were inoculated for smallpox.
\par \tab HB:  For smallpox.  They usual when you go overseas you know?
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  See my dad had a valid passport.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  That passport was good until 1941.  I think that's what it says, I still have it here.
  So he was German, but he was Jewish, so there was a big "J" on it.  But I mean, he could have gone with his passport anywhere in the world, providing they would\'85
\par \tab JF:  Take him.
\par \tab HB:  Take Germans.
\par \tab JF:  Your mother had a passport as well.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, of course, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  And what about you?
\par \tab HB:  I didn't have a pass--I was with my mother's.  On my mother's but I didn't have a picture.  See they had a picture.  So I was with my mother's, on my mother's passport.
\par \tab JF:  Your name is\'85
\par \tab HB:  \'85Because I was underage.  I was not 10 years old.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  If I would have been 10 years and over, I would have had a passport also.
\par \tab JF:  So you were not allowed, when you were on the boat, you were able to sneak up and view this very\'85
\par \tab HB:  And view the Second Class, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  But was there any kind of planned activity for the Third Class passengers or was it\'85
\par \tab HB:  I don't remember.  I\'85
\par \tab JF:  \'85or was it informal?
\par \tab HB:  It was very informal.
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  We just, the only activities that I remember were just cafeteria style, we ate, and the Second Class had their dining rooms.
\par \tab JF:  Now in your family group, you had mentioned your uncle.  Did he go with you?
\par \tab HB:  No, not with us.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  He went, he went ahead of us\'85
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  \'85to China.  On a different boat.  A lot of people went on Italian liners, and we had to go on a Japanese freighter.  
\par \tab JF:  What were the Japanese like who were running the boat?
\par \tab HB:  Oh, they were terrific.  They treated us just like regular passengers.  And no, there was no [unclear].  I did not know as a child, I did not know that they were at war with China already.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  And they gave us a beautiful--and I was so mad I had to give it up--beautiful Japanese flag, you know made out of silk.
\par \tab JF:  Because you were on the boat?\tab 
\par \tab HB:  On the boat, yeah.  They all gave us one flag and, but they told us better not take it to China because they are at war.  If somebody sees us with this Japanese flag, they m
ight, who knows, you know?  So I had to give it up and somebody else--you know that, excuse me, I think the boat went to China and, I think, went to Japan also.
\par \tab JF:  You had to give it up before you left the boat.
\par \tab HB:  I didn't have to give it up, but under the advisement of my parents...
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  No I didn't have to give it up.  
\par \tab JF:  I see.
\par \tab HB:  Oh no.
\par \tab JF:  I see.  It was your parents' suggestion.
\par \tab HB:  My parents suggestion, "You better!", I had no idea, no inkling why I had to give it up.  But then I found out later on, then I realized they were at war with the Chinese since 1937.

\par \tab JF:  This is Tape one, Side two of an interview with Mr. Broh.
\par \tab HB:  Ok, now in 
Bombay, we stopped in Bombay.  We stopped in Columbia.  That's, isn't that Indonesia?  [unclear] was it also India.  I cannot [unclear] but I know in Columbia I was pic--I have a picture, I was pictured on a rickshaw, you know with the native.  My mother 
was standing, and then in Singapore, Hong Kong, we stopped there.
\par \tab JF:  So you were able to get off the ship and\'85
\par \tab HB:  Of course. Yeah, yeah.  
\par \tab JF:  What\'85
\par \tab HB:  \'85like tourist, like regular tourist.
\par \tab JF:  What do you remember from those stops?
\par \tab 
HB:  The stops?  I remember in Singapore that people came up to the ship and tried to sell Persian carpets, and because they were a lot of Indians, too, East Indians.  And there were a lot of, a lot of East Indians, as a matter of fact boarded, they board
e
d the--whether it was Bombay or Singapore, I cannot recollect--boarded the ship and they were--they booked to China.  And as my recollection was, the British at that time used the East Indians for police in some sections.  And we had a lot of East Indian 
Sikhs.  They were policemen in China and they're nice people.  And during the war, those Sikhs, one of the Sikhs came to the house and sold milk.  They had their own cow, like }{\i\fs24 Fiddler on the Roof, }{\fs24 
reminds me of.  And it was expensive, very rare, my mother bought milk, but once in a while we use to get butter from this Indian family.
\par \tab JF:  So these stops were positive?  They were\'85
\par \tab HB:  Oh yeah, definitely, yeah we were treated like tourists.  And I was, as a child I had a ball.  
\par \tab JF:  What\'85
\par \tab HB:  I did not, you know I was not old enough really to enjoy the concept of tourism cause I was just, you know\'85
\par \tab JF:  Wide-eyed.
\par \tab HB:  \'85just gazing all over.  I mean with such an amazement.
\par \tab JF:  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  Such amazement.  And I remember the carts in Hong Kong and Singapore and of course, Hong Kong, my conception of was very dirty and\'85
\par \tab JF:  At the time, when you saw it?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, when I saw it.  Also, Naples was very dirty.  Naples, very dirty.  And they had these carts and the donkeys and mules.  Everyone had mules.
\par \tab JF:  Had you any preconceptions about what these places would look like before you got there?
\par \tab HB:  Not really, no.  I did not.
\par \tab JF:  So it was all very new\'85
\par \tab HB:  Very new, very new, yeah.  Like I said a lot of peop--I remember people came up to the shi
p and tried to sell Persian carpets.  I remember, my parents never bought one.  But they were, I remember we were to watch out for them.  "They are conniving people.  You had better watch out.  And watch your money and watch your belongings, you know, whe
n they come on board."
\par \tab JF:  Were there other children that you met on the boat?
\par \tab HB:  No, funny, you know, no, no, not really, not that I remember.  I was the only, I was the only child, unless they had really infants but yeah, I was the only child.  There
 were not too many passengers, cause it was a combination freighter.  To me that was fascinating to watch them take the cargo off the ships and then loading the cargo back from all these places.  To me, I was watching them for hours, to do that.  I rememb
er the noise of the cranes.  As I'm speaking to you\'85
\par \tab JF:  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  I just, I never think about these things.  Now that I am speaking to you, I remember the noises of the cranes, of these, you know, of these\'85
\par \tab JF:  Fascinating machines\'85
\par \tab HB:  Fascinating machines at that time, yes.  Yes.
\par \tab JF:  Could you, did you re-enact any of these things that you were seeing?  Did you play on the boat?
\par \tab HB:  I was, no, no.  I was, it must come from these probably, when I lived in China, I use to have a board.  It had a 
hole in it, kind of a--I use to put in underneath my bed, my bedsheet and I would pretend I was on a boat.  I was in a porthole room.  That was my porthole.
\par \tab JF:  The board\'85
\par \tab HB:  That was strange, the board, I have\'85
\par \tab JF:  The next year yet\'85
\par \tab HB:  I have the board like a, like a yeah.  I put the cover over it, but there was enough space to see out, to see out in the room, you know?  That was my little hide-a-way, that was my little boat\'85
\par \tab JF:  Oh.
\par \tab HB:  That was a, you know?
\par \tab JF:  That was a safe place?
\par \tab HB:  Safe place, exactly.
\par \tab JF:  This boat\'85
\par \tab HB:  That boat, how funny, funny, I never think about this, now with talking about, yeah\'85
\par \tab JF:  So there was, you made a hole in the board?
\par \tab HB:  No, no.  It was already, it was already in there, you k
now two boards nailed together on a, I don't know what we used it for.  To stand up on something, you know stand up like a, like a step stool more or less and I take this to bed and put, there was a space like this, you know?
\par \tab JF:  Like a couple inches\'85
\par \tab HB:  And I, yeah, a couple inches and that was my little hide-a-way, my little boat.
\par \tab JF:  How long did you do that?
\par \tab HB:  Maybe until I was, probably nine years, nine years or so.  I still, yeah, I was crazy.  That's what it was.  Yeah, I felt safe there.
\par \tab JF:  Very safe.
\par \tab HB:  Very safe.
\par \tab JF:  Did you think back to the boat at other times or was it, the board was\'85
\par \tab HB:  The board was a\'85
\par \tab JF:  Represents.
\par \tab HB:  \'85a substitution of that boat, yeah.  I was sad that the trip was over, in a way at that time.  Yo
u know, but we could walk freer in China and freer, I mean you know there was other things that, other adventures that I remember I went with my cousin, I went to the wharves and watched the boats and come in and go out and\'85
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember the day that you arrived in?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, the day was\'85
\par \tab JF:  In Shanghai.
\par \tab HB:  In Shanghai, it was in 19--well the day, we left in April so it took four weeks, so it must have been some time in May.
\par \tab JF:  Of 1939?
\par \tab HB:  Of 1939, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  And can you tell me about the day that you arrived, what it was like.
\par \tab HB:  The day that I arrived, I had to give up my flag, unfortunately.
\par \tab JF:   Your parent's suggestion?
\par \tab HB:  My parents suggested that I give this, because some people were going farther, were going to Japan\'85
\par \tab JF:  Oh.
\par \tab HB:  You see?  Some of people were, yeah\'85
\par \tab JF:  Some of the refugees were\'85
\par \tab HB:  The refugees were going--then later on they had to come back but, and also there were a certain amount of Japanese passengers.  And the
y went to Japan from--and that was my big disappointment, I had to give up the flag.  And, I know, I do not have much recollection, as we got off the boat, the plank there, that--'cause what I see in pictures, they were being put on trucks, some of the re
fugees were put, and then they were going to a center, what is it called, the\'85

\par \tab HB: But my family, see, I do not remember.  I'm trying to think because my uncle must have already bought the house because they were, oh yes, they were ahead of us.  So they, he already had a house.

\par \tab HB:  My uncle, my dad's brother.

\par \tab JF:  So this four, family of four was\'85

\par \tab JF:  This is your father's brother.
\par \tab HB:  Brother.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  He was in the textile business\'85
\par \tab JF:  Right.
\par \tab HB:  \'85in Germany and he had a little bit money.
\par \tab JF:  So he had a house\'85
\par \tab HB:  He had a house.  He bought a house on Seward Road, remember?  You hear that so many times, you know.
\par \tab JF:  Seward.  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  Seward Road.
\par \tab JF:  And which section was Seward Road?
\par \tab HB:  Hongkew.}{\b\fs24 
\par }{\fs24 \tab JF:  In Hongkew.  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  We arrived.  There was the occupation, there was Japanese occupation already.  Some people left for the French Concession and the British, for the French, yeah, and the British settlement.
\par \tab JF:  But your uncle had bought the house.
\par \tab HB:  Bought a house in Hongkew, yeah.  That was outside the, you know, the perimeter}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 of the ghetto, so to speak.
\par \tab JF:  What was it like?  He, you got off the boat and you\'85
\par \tab HB:  Well, the living standard, we had a--let's put it this way, we had all the conveniences of Western liv
ing.  We had a WC, a regular bathroom and toilet, toilet, flushing toilet, and we--I went to, and then, of course, I was enrolled in the Kadoorie School later on, about a month or so, later on, I imagine.  So, and then my, when on my ninth birthday, it wa
s 1939, 1940.  On my ninth birthday, my parents decided to enroll me into a religious school, just like you send your kids here to relig--to Sunday School.  A relig\'85
\par \tab JF:  A religious school.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Before we go on to that, can you tell me whatever you remember about those early days.  Do you think it's possible that your uncle met you at the boat, or do you remember how you got to Hongkew?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, I know--that's blank.
\par \tab JF:  That's blank.
\par \tab HB:  That is completely blank.
\par \tab JF:  Are any sights or smells or sounds or things that\'85
\par \tab HB:  The sights were turmoil, was turmoil.  You just picture yourself, the coolies and all the beggars, and the coolies.  That was fairly new to me, and things that--it was not as clean as we left Germany, you know and\'85
\par \tab JF:  How did it feel?
\par \tab HB:  To me as a kid, it was something new.  It didn't bother me.  Really, it didn't.
\par \tab JF:  It was again exciting?
\par \tab HB:  It was exciting.  To me it was exciting, yes.  Something new.
\par \tab JF:  Scary at all?
\par \tab HB:  Not, no, not at all.
\par \tab JF:  Not a bit.
\par \tab HB:  Not a bit, no.  No, it's the noise and the--I wasn't used to it, but it was exciting, yes.  It was exciting.  And people, these panhandlers and all this kind of stuff that, later on of course, when I witnessed all of these beggars and
 all of these--you know the British, they established a shelter house there, but they never would stay in the shelter house.
\par \tab JF:  So the beggars were\'85
\par \tab HB:  They were professional beggars.
\par \tab JF:  From where?
\par \tab HB:  From Shanghai.
\par \tab JF:  They were Chinese.
\par \tab HB:  Oh yeah, Chinese.
\par \tab JF:  They were Chinese beggars.
\par \tab HB:  Oh yeah, of course, you know.   They were Chinese.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.  When you got to this house, how many rooms did you have in this house with...
\par \tab HB:  There were about, let's see downstairs and smaller room, upstairs, I would say four rooms.  Four rooms, actually.
\par \tab JF:  In the whole house?
\par \tab HB:  In the whole house.  Four rooms and with the entr--well, including the entrance.  He partitioned the entrance, my uncle did.  So he bought another rental.  So 
he had three people that were renting from him.  My parents, I don't know if there was any monetary changed.  I would have no idea.  I don't know.
\par \tab JF:  Right.
\par \tab HB:  And then he rented to a shoemaker, and then he rented to a young couple.
\par \tab JF:  So did each family have it's own bedroom?  Is that how it worked?
\par \tab HB:  No, no, no\'85
\par \tab JF:  There were that many rooms?
\par \tab HB:  Yes, no, oh yes, that's it.  That's it.  We had, we just partitioned with curtains, you know.  There was nonexistent a room and a bedroom. 
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  We used the same toilet.  No.  Same bathroom. 
\par \tab JF:  So your family had one room.
\par \tab HB:  One room, yeah\'85
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85And then there was a one WC for the...
\par \tab HB:  For the whole, for the whole house.
\par \tab JF:  \'85for everybody, and a kitchen\'85
\par \tab HB:  And a kitchen.
\par \tab JF:  \'85for everyone.  And how, was the kitchen equipped with\'85?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, gas.  Yeah, it was gas.  We did not hardly cook with charcoal.  Later on we did charcoal, the charcoal bit.
\par \tab JF:  Did you have heat?  Did you need heat?
\par \tab HB:  Heat?  That's when we used the charcoal furnace.  I mean for heat, yes.  But you see when the proclamation came, when despite this was Hongkew.  It was outside the perimeter--my uncle had a choice, to sell the house or exchange
 the house with somebody that lived inside this perimeter of the--I hate to say ghetto, I can't use that terminology again\'85
\par \tab JF:  So this house was not within the ghetto perimeter\'85
\par \tab HB:  Not within the ghetto.  It was outside the ghetto.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  So he exchanged the house for the, he was lucky, with a Japanese family.  It was very clean, and then he did some little minor renovation, and then so he could divide again, each one had one room.  And but we didn't have a WC, unfortunately.

\par \tab JF:  Oh.  Once you went into the ghetto area.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah we didn't, maybe some people had, but in that particular house didn't have it.  We had the old, the old, we used to call it "honey wagon", every morning. 
\par \tab JF:  The honey wagon?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.  I used to come, oh gosh.  We used to watch and we\'85
\par \tab JF:  It was actually a wagon?
\par \tab HB:  A wagon on two, on wheels, yeah, they picked it up every morning\'85
\par \tab JF:  Did they pushed or\'85
\par \tab HB:  They pushed.  Well, one fellow pushed it.
\par \tab JF:  And they picked up the slop pots.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah,
 the, yeah, the slop pots.  Then the women, the Chinese women.  We were--ok, we were living in, the street was called Yuhang Road but there was, we lived in a lane.  So there was actually a street within a street, and we lived in this lane, so to speak.  
I
t's like a little tiny street, but it was a lane, so you, when you walked out of the gate, then you were on a main street. So we lived--we were the only foreigners in that particular lane.  So we never, I never felt when the terminology of the ghetto, we 
lived with Chinese, how could you, you know.  And when this honey wagon came in the morning, we could see the Chinese women cleaning their little pots, you know, floating down the, down the, down the\'85
\par \tab JF:  Down the street?
\par \tab HB:  Down the, it wasn't sewerlike, down the street.
\par \tab JF:  Now, when you were living on Seward}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 Road in the first house.
\par \tab HB:  The first, yeah, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Were you living among refugees?
\par \tab HB:  Well\'85
\par \tab JF:  Also a mixed population\'85
\par \tab HB:  A mixed, it was mixed.  A mixed population, you bet.  Yes.
\par \tab JF:  And you had about a month before you started school, you said.
\par \tab HB:  About, approximately, yes.
\par \tab JF:  Approximately.  And what did you do?  Were you able to explore during that time?  Do you remember that period before school started for you?
\par \tab HB:  Not really, no.  I was--the only time I would explore the streets were when my cousin, and as I told you before, like we went to the wharf and watched the boats come in and that was fascinating to me then\'85
\par \tab JF:  The boats were boats of refugees or\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, no.  Freighters\'85
\par \tab JF:  The other boats.  Freighters.
\par \tab HB:  Freighters
\par \tab JF:  Because it was a port city.
\par \tab HB:  Of course, it was a port city.
\par \tab JF:  So you got to watch them\'85
\par \tab HB:  Watch them.  But then I watched the junks.  We used to go to the particular area when we, where people, the Chinese use to live in those junks.  That was fascinating to me.
\par \tab JF:  Oh.
\par \tab HB:  And, well you seen them in Hong Kong, you know. They live on the river.  And, as a matter of fact, we took a taxi junk, my family did once.  That was before the\'85
\par \tab JF:  Before the war.
\par \tab HB:  War.  We crossed the Whangpoo River to Pootoong, was farming country.  That was fascinating.
\par \tab JF:  What was it like?
\par \tab HB:  Was like.  It was, th
at's where a lot of Chinese people bury their dead.  All the, they were burying them, instead of in the ground they were burying them on top of the ground.  They had these, I don't know if they're still doing it or not, but it must be the old, the old cus
tom and when--I remember we had a funeral in our lane and every house was decorated except our house, and it interrupted this decoration, these like, like these silver paper, [unclear], I can't think of it now.  
\par \tab JF:  These were, the Chinese decorated their homes?
\par \tab HB:  The Chinese decorated all their homes except ours, because we were the only foreigners there.  And then they had a big feast, a big funeral.  So that must be one of the\'85
\par \tab JF:  One of the customs.
\par \tab HB:  Well yeah, the customs.  It was a very prominent citizen, probably prominent person, that they did perform the funeral with.
\par \tab JF:  Now when you had this opportunity to roam the streets, to go to the wharves, were you aware of all of the different peoples who were living there at that time, the other Jewish communities as well?
\par \tab HB:  Jewish community?  Yeah, of course.  Like I said, my parents enrolled me in that so called Hebrew school.  And little did they know that was a brain-washing institution.
\par \tab JF:  Now this was the Shanghai\'85
\par \tab HB:  Shanghai.
\par \tab JF:  Shanghai Jewish Youth Organization.\tab 
\par \tab HB:  No, no, no.  That was the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .
\par \tab JF:  We're not talking about the regular school.
\par \tab HB:  No, I went to regular school in the morning, and I went to }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24  [religious school] in the afternoon.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.  So that the\'85
\par \tab HB:  You know, just like you send your kid to Sunday School.  But little did they know, it was a brain-washing institution.
\par \tab JF:  Now we're talking about the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .
\par \tab HB:  That was before the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24  [upper level Jewish religious school] came in.
\par \tab JF:  Who ran the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 ?
\par \tab HB:  The }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24  were supported by Russian Jews.  And the teachers were primarily refugees from Austria, religious people.  And one of the rabbis}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 that was my teacher, what 
was his name,  Rabbi Perlmutter, was a tough cookie.  And I mean very strict.
\par \tab JF:  So he was from Austria.
\par \tab HB:  He was from Austria but in, what is it called, Galicia, have you ever heard of that?  He was from that area.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Then we had another teacher from Germany, also religious person.
\par \tab JF:  So the Russian refugees\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, there were not any Russian refugees.
\par \tab JF:  Or the, from the earlier period.
\par \tab HB:  Oh, from the 1914-15. 
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.  There were two ladies I hear from.  They were Russ--they were born in Shanghai, as a matter of fact.
\par \tab JF:  But the Russians had supported this }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 . They established the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24  but it was staffed by people\'85
\par \tab HB:  By refugees.
\par \tab JF:  Refugees.  Ok.
\par \tab HB: Yeah, sure.
\par \tab JF:  And what, when you say that it was brain-washing\'85
\par \tab HB:  Brain-washing.  Like I mentioned--my, oh I didn't maybe mention this.  My parents were not too observant, and due to the fact that I've learned, and they teach you, well, it's not right to, see my dad never wore a hat on the street and\'85

\par \tab JF:  A hat, a }{\i\fs24 kippah}{\fs24 , or a hat?
\par \tab HB:  No, no a regular hat.
\par \tab JF:  Even a hat.
\par \tab HB:  Even a hat, you know.
\par \tab JF:  Even a hat.
\par \tab HB:  And you're not supposed to you're supposed to have all this, some type of a head gear when you go out.  So they said it is not proper to do that.  So of course, I start to wear a }{\i\fs24 kippah}{\fs24  and I start to wear these undergarments--

\par \tab JF:  The }{\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva}{\fs24 .
\par \tab HB:  The }{\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva}{\fs24  came.  I went to this }{\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva}{\fs24  but not the main }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24 .  I went to the }{\i\fs24 Yeshiva}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 K'tanah}{\fs24 .  It's the, one step down from\'85
\par \tab JF: }{\i\fs24 K'tanah}{\fs24  [small].
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, }{\i\fs24 K'tanah}{\fs24 , and my, now my cousin continues to it and he went to the, he had received the }{\i\fs24 semichah}{\fs24  [rabbinic ordination], I mean he was\'85
\par \tab JF:  So he stayed and studied with the }{\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva}{\fs24 .
\par \tab HB:  With the }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24 , yeah.  He's in Australia now and he's a teaching rabbi.  He's semi-retired now.  But he has, }{\i\fs24 kayn ayen hore}{\fs24 
 [knock on wood], 23 grandchildren.  [laughter]  I don't have to tell you--and I asked my cousin's wife, you know, I says, how many are you going to have?  He says whatever, this is not enough.  That's their attitude.

\par \tab HB:  I have a picture of the }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Yeshiva}{\fs24  in that book there.
\par \tab JF:  Now how long did you stay involved with them?
\par \tab HB:  I start, I stayed involved with them until I was about--until I left Shanghai but I was not going to, see, I quit Kadoorie School.  Actually I quit the Kadoorie School, how old was I?  12, and I went almost full time to }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 
 at that time.
\par \tab JF:  Is that why you quit?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, I, yeah, pretty sure--I was young, you know, I, before my Bar Mitzvah, I was--I did quit, maybe I was 14 years old, so 12, 14 years old, 12 or 14, I cannot recollect.
\par \tab JF:  It was before your Bar Mitzvah?
\par \tab HB:  I think, well I don't know now.  If I did quit, not before, because I remember I was so preoccupied with my  teach--my learning about being Bar Mitzvah'ed.  And I was--I'm pretty sure I was full time in }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\b\fs24 -}{\fs24 
-morning and the afternoon.
\par \tab JF:  And that's why you quit?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, and then I was 15, 14 or 15, this Rabbi Perlmutter said I'm not the studio type, so to speak.  I should become a, do you know what }{\i\fs24 baal melakha}{\fs24 
 is?  It's a tradesman, a tradesperson.  And he got me a job, this rabbi got me a job in a jewelry store as an apprentice, as a watch--but I had to, with a stipulation, I had to continue to go to this }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 
 and I had a one-to-one tutor in the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 .  I was tutored by a different, from a }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24  Rabbi and, but I was working, so I was working in this store but I had to, so I was 14 or 15.
\par \tab JF:  This was, you were an apprentice in order to sell, to make jewelry?
\par \tab HB:  Oh no, watch repair.
\par \tab JF:  Watch repair.
\par \tab HB:  Watch repair.  I never adopted to that trade anyway.  I hated it later on.  I tried when I went to Minnesota.  I tried it again but I hated it, I just hated it.
\par \tab JF:  When you were in the Kadoorie}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 School, what was that like for you?
\par \tab HB:  To me?
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  Just like any other school.  The only pla--the only course I flunked was Japanese.  It was forced.  We were compulsory, you know, to learn Japanese.
\par \tab JF:  And Chinese, too?
\par \tab HB:  Chinese was not compulsory, no.  I didn't know how--I can double talk Chinese, however I can double talk almost any language.  Remember Sid Caesar [laughter]\'85
\par \tab JF:  Yes, yes. I do. [laughter].  But Japanese was actually, was the mandated course?
\par \tab HB:  It was mandated course.  We had a Chinese teacher, I mean, a Japanese teacher and she was not much of a discipl\'85

\par \tab HB:  Yeah.

\par \tab HB:  Well, as you can see Japanese was not my best subject.
\par \tab JF:  No.
\par \tab HB:  \'85And this is a better one, well, I was two years prior and we didn't--I don't know, I just didn't, I didn't really care 
much for school.  I was the joker.  I was the joker of the class.  I think I was the joker of the class, and did it say more talkative, does it say on this one?  Anyway, there is one of them that says I was very talkative.
\par \tab JF:  Well, this one says you could do much better.  
\par \tab HB:  Do much better, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85you should study more and be more attentive.
\par \tab HB:  More attentive, right, right. [laughter]  This is an earlier much better one, but so, no, I had a ball there, I mean I was carefree, so to speak, and I had made a lot of friends there.
\par \tab JF:  Tell me about that, tell me about your friends.
\par \tab HB:  My friends?  See I had two types of friends.  Friends from this school here were, did not go to }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\b\fs24 ,}{\fs24  did not go to the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 , so consequently they were a d
ifferent breed of people, so to speak.  I don't know if that's the right terminology or not, but they were, some of them were non-observant, I mean, just like--and then I, of course, the transition all takes place when I had [unclear] friends in }{
\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 , so from one extreme to the other.  
\par \tab JF:  Did you have both groups of friends at the same time or\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85or did you move?
\par \tab HB:  No, when I was Bar Mitzvahed, this was 1943.  Evidently I must have had friends on both at the same time, yes.  We ha
d a fellow that, I don't know his last name, too bad, and he went to Australia.  Very good friend.  Name is Willy, and he was half-Jewish, and his mother was not Jewish, or somebody wasn't Jewish, and best friend, one of my best friends, you know.  It did
 not make any difference to me at that time whether somebody was religious or non-religious, you know.  To me, personally.
\par \tab JF:  What impact had this all had on your parents in terms of how\'85
\par \tab HB:  Oh, they were\'85
\par \tab JF:  \'85your home was, you say your cousin had also become\'85
\par \tab HB:  Oh yes.
\par \tab JF:  \'85observant and wanted to keep kosher.
\par \tab HB:  Sure.
\par \tab JF:  So that meant the whole household changed.
\par \tab HB:  The whole household, yeah.  Not the people that he rented, the other people that my uncle rented, no they were--to my recollection they were not that observant, no.
\par \tab JF:  But the kitchen had been koshered.
\par \tab HB:  Oh, well the kitchen, everybody was on their own.  We usually sometimes cooked separate.  And we cooked, you know, we had our own pots and pans.
\par \tab JF:  OK.
\par \tab HB:  You know?  So there was no, the only time we, sometimes we ate together just a family but not the other people.
\par \tab JF:  Did your parents then also become more observant?
\par \tab HB:  My parents?  No, not so much.  My uncle did though, became more observant, but not--no, I don't think so.  I didn't go to, he never went to the }{\i\fs24 Shabbat}{\fs24 
 services with me.  I went.  To me it was compulsory, obligation, to do that, you know.  And I was sometimes ashamed, which was, which is wrong, I mean so ridiculous.  Sometimes my d
ad wouldn't wear a hat, so he would go on one street and I would go on the other street.  G-d forbid one of my rabbi's should see me you know with my dad, you know, I was embarrassed.  I was embarrassed actually, and this is wrong sometimes when you, when
 
they teach kids, well if it has something to do with, no you can break this commandment "Thou shalt honor your parents",  you know.  You can break this commandment only in certain circumstances, when it was, when it pertains towards Judaism.  And it was w
r
ong, you know.  I realized it later in years.  I mean it was ridiculous.  Why should I be ashamed to go with my father on the street?  So, so anyway it's--then I later on I changed myself.  I changed.  So in order to comply to, I can be--like I said, I ca
n be acclimated to any surroundings, to any community.  I can mix in easy with secular people, you know.  I can act the same ways, you know, to respect.
\par \tab JF:  Do you attribute this flexibility in any way to your experience in Shanghai?
\par \tab HB:  No, it's my own feeling.
\par \tab JF:  It's just your own personal\'85
\par \tab HB:  My own personality, my own personal feeling.  I learned and I'm very tolerant and, a lot of adversity happened in my life after I left Shanghai, and I do not have any, just like Rabbi Kushner I am, what happens to\'85
\par \tab JF:  Good things happen\'85
\par \tab HB:  Good things happen, well, what happens to bad\'85
\par \tab JF:  Bad things happen.
\par \tab HB:  Bad things happen to good people, yeah.  I feel the same, I mean I have this tremendous faith, you know and , things you know.  Like I s
aid, to me personally Shanghai was the best years of my life.  And the adversity came after I came to this country in certain things.
\par \tab JF:  Oh boy.
\par \tab HB:  I mean it's silly, but the things were happening in this country that you know.  I was married, sick w
ife, and I lost a son at 40, and all these kind of things and it seems like my cousin despite, I mean he has 23 grandchildren.  Sometimes I get a little bit jealous because this, their life--well they live in a different world in, you know, they don't fac
e reality sometimes [unclear].  But they live in their own little, like }{\i\fs24 Fiddler on the Roof}{\fs24 
, they're contented and--so, sometimes I wonder, well, is this a good life or not, you know, but--so I go back and forth sometimes, you know.  But in general speaking, no, no, I'm a  pretty happy-go-lucky fellow.
\par \tab JF:  So you had this ability as a kid to be friends with these\'85
\par \tab HB:  Oh definitely.
\par \tab JF:  Guys and girls as well?
\par \tab HB:  Not so much with girls, no.  I, see that, again, I sure looked at girls, you know.  I mean you had this feeling for girls.  When I was a little older,14, you know you had this--but that was again, taboo.
\par \tab JF:  Because you had become more identified with the traditional\'85
\par \tab HB: Identified with the traditional way, yeah.  I'll tell you a little humorous story about taboo now.  On Yom Kippur, there is this }{\i\fs24 Torah}{\fs24 
 portion of the--all these commandments, thou shalt not do this, and thou shalt not do that, and thou shalt not, it's all in the, you know we studied this in }{\i\fs24 Torah}{\fs24  and thou shalt not lay wi
th any, doesn't say cohabit, but lay with any beast or with any animal.  It just said lay.  So I asked the Rabbi at that time, what does it mean?  "}{\i\fs24 Geh weiter}{\fs24 ," go on he said, "go to next page."
\par \tab JF:  [laughter]
\par \tab HB:  You know, wouldn't explain anything.  I mean so you were so na}{\f28\fs24 \'56}{\fs24 
ve. So we had a cat in China, and that cat, [laughter] yes, you guessed it, was laid on my bed all the time.  Ever since that portion I've learned I shushed him away, cause I was not supposed to lay with him, you know?  [laughter] 
 So that's how, in a way, it's kind of a comic, but that's how they teach you, you know.  Until later on in years, when you went to }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 , you went to the big }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 
, you knew more about the facts of life, but I was so na}{\f28\fs24 \'56}{\fs24 ve about the facts of life even when I, when I left Shanghai I didn\rquote t'even know the facts of life too much.
\par \tab JF:  Now when you dropped out of the Kadoorie School around the time of your Bar Mitzvah.
\par \tab HB: Yeah, I think I was about 14, I can't conceive I was 13 here.
\par \tab JF:  At that point, did your friendships change?
\par \tab HB:  No, no.
\par \tab JF:  Were you still kept\'85
\par \tab HB:  We still kept in touch, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85your relationships.  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  A lot of people left Kadoorie School for some reason or another.  I don't know why.  But no, even the people who did not leave Kadoorie School.  No, we always came, we were in contact.
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember any contact with the children of the Jews who had lived in Shanghai before you got there?  The Sephardic}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 community, the Russian community?
\par \tab HB:  No, no.  The only contact that I had was my English teacher.  I don't even know if I can see her name here or not.
\par \tab JF:  Was that?\'85
\par \tab HB:  Excuse me.
\par \tab JF:  Would that be L.B. or would that\'85
\par \tab HB:  Could be L.B.  Could be.
\par \tab JF:  Her initials might be L.B.  
\par \tab HB:  Could be, pretty much.  Could be.
\par \tab JF:  And she was from one of these communities?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, she was from, she was Sephardic.}{\b\fs24   }{\fs24 She was from Iraq.  And I didn't have much contact otherwise, except we had, later on they had a combination of with the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .  They had a whole group of }{\i\fs24 
Bet Ya'akov}{\fs24  girls and they were, I remember this one girl, she was from Iraq.  Her name was Sima and I had a little crush on her.
\par \tab JF:  And she was\'85
\par \tab HB:  And that was about\'85
\par \tab JF:  So she was from one of the, from the earlier\'85
\par \tab HB:  From the earlier\'85
\par \tab JF:  Sephardic families who joined the }{\i\fs24 Bet Ya'akov}{\fs24  School.
\par \tab HB:  Exactly, yeah.  Of course, I met one Russian individual.  He was from, he lived in China since the, you know.  He came, one of the wealthy Russians, every Hanukkah he gave us shoes.  Yeah, he donated shoes for us, every Hanukkah.
\par \tab JF:  In the, when you were in the school.
\par \tab HB:  Not in the school, in the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .
\par \tab JF:  In the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .
\par \tab HB:  The Russians didn't have much to do with the Kadoorie Schools.  
\par \tab JF:  Ok.  The Sephardi did?
\par \tab HB:  Sephardi?  I don't think so either. 
\par \tab JF:  Ok.  They just\'85
\par \tab HB:  They had their own little community.  Their own schools.  I didn\rquote t come in contact with too many Sephardic Jews.
\par \tab JF:  When you had your Bar Mitzvah\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85Can you describe what it was like?
\par \tab HB:  Oh, it was a feast.  It was a feast\'85
\par \tab JF:  And this was during the war.
\par \tab HB:  During the war, 1943.  It, I was taught, at the Bar Mitzvah, I was taught by another refugee who was specializing in teaching boys Bar Mitzvah.  His name was Amsterdam, and he lived on, in one of these homes, these }{\i\fs24 Heime}{\fs24 
, I forget which one it was, Chaoufoong Heim or Ward Road Heim, I don\rquote t know, one of these and he--it was a heck of a way of living, you know, because he had no privacy in those homes.
\par \tab JF:  These were the camps.
\par \tab HB:  Camps, well, camps.
\par \tab JF:  They were "in quotes."
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  It was a communal.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah right, but they all slept in one big auditorium.  They had these bunk beds, you know.  And there was no, hardly any privacy there.  And you know, these were the, that particular tape of Mr. Hepner.  He described these and I thi
nk he lived in one of those camps and\'85
\par \tab JF:  But you were always able to live in this house\'85
\par \tab HB:  In a house, and then after my uncle had changed this house, we lived in another house and\'85
\par \tab JF:  And you did not find\'85
\par \tab HB:  I did not find\'85
\par \tab JF:  Your food was not limited?
\par \tab HB:  Was not, no, no.  No, maybe a repetition of foods, like rice, and we had, yeah I remember rice and little bits of meat, you know?   That goulash-type thing and kasha.  We had a lot of kasha and eggplants.  I remember eggplants.  Love
d, plentiful of eggplants and tofu, lot of tofu, and we had eggs, plentiful eggs, I remember and.
\par \tab JF:  You don't remember any limits of\'85
\par \tab HB:  I don't remember actually any limits.  As a matter of fact, my mother sent me out for bread to the bakery.  So m
y cousin and I went for bread.  I mean, let's put it this way, it was not that it was plentiful, but it was sufficient.  So we used, we took a rickshaw ride and guess what?  Instead of--we didn't have any money-- so we gave the coolie our bread for our ri
ckshaw ride.  Of course, I never heard the end of it. [laughter]  So that day we were out of bread, but we had a rickshaw}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 ride.  I don't know, I forget how old I was, 12 or whatever.
\par \tab JF:  [laughter]  That's wonderful.  Now you said, when you had your Bar Mitzvah, this was within the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva }{\fs24 at this point.
\par \tab HB:  Yes, within the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva }{\fs24 compound, yes. Well, it was the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24  compound and in that same }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 
 that we were brought up--we learned in the morning, we learned in the, well, actually in the morning I went to school everyday but\'85
\par \tab JF:  And what was the name of the }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 ?
\par \tab HB:  Ohel Moshe, Ohel Moshe School.  It was within the perimeter of the quote, unquote - ghetto.  That's, the }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24  was built by Russians also.  As a matter of fact, the }{\i\fs24 shames}{\fs24  [sexton] was [laughter], the }{
\i\fs24 shames}{\fs24  went, was a Russian and a, you know what a }{\i\fs24 shames}{\fs24  is?
\par \tab JF:  Yes.  Of course.  What was it like, was it, the day of your Bar Mitzvah?
\par \tab HB:  The day of the Bar Mitzvah--first of all, they complimented my dad.  They wished my dad, oh what a good job he did, oh what a good job, what a good job, but little did they know that my mother pushed me to go to }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .
\par \tab JF:  Ah [chuckle]
\par \tab HB:  See, they always gave credit to the men, and it was a little bit, it was not too fair.  You know, there
 are prayer books nowadays where it says, "Blessed be Thou oh Lord our G-d, who has not created me as a woman."  And then the woman says, "Blessed be Thou Lord G-d of the Universe, who created me according to thy will."  So these Orthodox prayer books don
't have that, you know.  So it's kind of a little bit prejudicial statement but then\'85
\par \tab JF:  Did you feel that at the time?
\par \tab HB:  No, no, no, I, no.  Not really, but later on in years I, you know, I elaborate these things, you know, no, I didn't\'85
\par \tab JF:  But it was your mother who had pushed you.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, my mother always pushed me and encouraged me to go, yeah.  My dad worked anyway.
\par \tab JF:  What kind of\'85
\par \tab HB:  All during the--my dad was working for a Japanese or a Chinese factory.  He was a watchman, and it was managed by Japanese. They made bolts, nuts and bolts.
\par \tab JF:  You are showing me a picture that you drew on the back of one of your report cards.
\par \tab HB:  [laughter]  
\par \tab JF:  Do you want to describe it.
\par \tab HB:  1941.  I don't even know what that is.  
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  It's just a scribble.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Like how old was I,  11 years old, 11 years.
\par \tab JF:  Your father was able to work the entire time that you were in Shanghai.
\par \tab HB:  Well, yes, he did, and he worked for this Chinese factory and it was managed by Japanese.  I'm sure that these nuts and bolts were not going for any civilian use.  I'm sure it was going\'85
\par \tab JF:  It was going for the war effort?
\par \tab HB:  It was going for the war effort.  I'm sure.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  But he had a job there.
\par \tab JF:  Do you know whether or not, he was able to work out a way of getting any money to Shanghai before you left?
\par \tab HB:  I don't know.  I think the, I remember he hid some American money\'85
\par \tab JF:  Go ahead.
\par \tab HB:  \'85after the war in suitcases because it was against the law
 to even have American money during the tremendous inflation that they had.  It was against the Chinese government to even own any--people were doing black markets.  But that's the only kind of money that I remember.
\par \tab JF:  Where do you think they got the American money?  In, do you think they brought it with them?
\par \tab HB:  No, they probably--well, he was, no, he worked for the American Army, too, after the war.
\par \tab JF:  Oh, in Shanghai.
\par \tab HB:  In Shanghai.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  What were, not to lose\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Some of the story\'85
\par \tab HB:  My Bar Mitzvah, we were talking about\'85
\par \tab JF:  Let's, yes.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, and like I said, they complimented my dad, and it was a regular feast and\'85
\par \tab JF:  That your mother prepared?  That the\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, the people [unclear] from my mother and my aunt and the whole community almost, the whole did prepare for--we were all within the spectrum of this }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 
.  Not the people that were associated with this school, but people that were associated with the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24  and the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 .  They all made these preparations and\'85
\par \tab JF:  Special foods?
\par \tab HB:  Oh, I do not remember.
\par \tab JF:  But it felt like a feast.
\par \tab HB:  It felt, yeah, it felt like a feast, yeah and--I attended a wedding there.  My cousin was married, I mean my cousin's, female, my female cousin\'85
\par \tab JF:  Yes, your, the older\'85
\par \tab HB:  Not girl cousin, the older one.  
\par \tab JF:  Yes, yes.
\par \tab HB:  Was married there, and I attended all the }{\i\fs24 sheva berachot}{\fs24 , you know, the seven blessings.  Every day they had a feast.  That was during the war and they had }{\i\fs24 schnapps}{\fs24 
 and the vodka and all kinds of stuff.  I mean\'85
\par \tab JF:  Were you?\'85
\par \tab HB:  It was, it was available there.
\par \tab JF:  It was there.
\par \tab HB:  It was there, if you had the money to purchase.
\par \tab JF:  Were you aware of the difficulty that the other refugees were having?
\par \tab HB:  Yes, we were aware of--we ate, a lot of times we ate in this community kitchen.  It was, I mean you talking about scar--I mean not all the time, it was plentiful.  I mean, at that time we had to go to this community kitchen and then we 
got our meals and then we had some sad, poor, I mean sad-looking people sold their practically the shirt off their back in order to survive there.  Yes, I seen those.  I was one of the lucky ones that did not go through that, and I'm sure Mr. Hepner was o
ne of the unlucky ones, what I gather from his video.  I have to talk to him here, I'll probably meet him here, that you know, that we're in the same category [unclear].
\par \tab JF:  Did you have any idea who was running these community kitchens, where the help was coming from?
\par \tab HB:  The help was coming partially from the religious Jews, because it was managed by }{\i\fs24 mashgiach}{\fs24\super 3{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0

\par \tab JF:  So this particular kitchen was a kosher kitchen?
\par \tab HB:  It was a--yeah.  It definitely was a kosher kitchen.  Now I don't know if there were other kitchens or not.  I have no way of recollection.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  The people that lived in these }{\i\fs24 Heime}{\fs24 , I don't know if they had their own kitchen or not.  But that particular kitchen my mother went to and I went to, was a kosher kitchen, yes.
\par \tab JF:  You mentioned before that you had every illness possible.
\par \tab HB:  Yes, yes.
\par \tab JF:  Can you tell me about\'85
\par \tab HB: 
 But I was lucky.  I was inoculated.  We all were inoculated for all these--and I was sent to a--first, I had malaria and recurrent every year, recurrent, and this Dr. Wolff happened to be in our cabin.  I remember when we came to, when we sailed to Shang
hai.  He had a, that he brought from France evidently, he was in France, too, a what is it called, an inoculation?
\par \tab JF:  The vaccine?
\par \tab HB:  The vaccine.  He had a vaccine that's supposed to have cured malaria and he gave me this vaccine.  I think he donated it to me somehow, cause I remember, cause, and ever since then I never had a recurrence.  That's what's weird.
\par \tab JF:  Were you in the hospital?
\par \tab HB:  Not for malaria.  Yeah, maybe I was, too, but was not an isolation hospital.  It was the local hospital that was established by the refugees, yes, and then I\'85
\par \tab JF:  Do you remember the name of the hospital?
\par \tab HB:  No, I don't.
\par \tab JF:  It was the special hospital that was\'85
\par \tab HB:  It was not special hospital.  See there was a, when I had, when I acquired this typhus
 and thyphoid, they, I was sent to an isolation hospital that was outside the ghetto, so to speak, and as we were--I was taken by ambulance and I could look outside the ambulance and I remember very vividly that there was a ship at the Bund, you know the 
Bund thing, you've heard of the Bund.  The\'85
\par \tab JF:  The avenues.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, but the Bund was right by the White River.  There were all these bank buildings that were built by a certain, by Sassoon families. There was the ship laying on its side.  I don't kno
w what it was so I--it was the Conte Verde, I think.  It was an Italian luxury liner and the Italians sank it--intended to sink it.  So the Japanese intended to salvage it for the war effort, and I remember the big chains around the big bank buildings in 
order to keep it afloat on its side.
\par \tab JF:  The Conte Verde.
\par \tab HB:  I think it was the Conte Verde.  Now I could be wrong, but I think it was the Conte Verde, an Italian luxury liner, and that's on the way to the hospital, and all these pictures, I mean I hav
e it in mind, yeah.  And then I came, I was in the hospital maybe for a week or so, and, gosh, I've seen so many people die of cholera}{\b\fs24 .}{\fs24   I mean, there was a big auditor, a big ward.  The ward was, you know\'85
\par \tab JF:  Now this hospital where you were you isolated, was this\'85
\par  \tab HB:  It was a Chinese hospital.
\par \tab JF:  It was a Chinese hospital, ok?
\par \tab HB:  \'85aAnd it was, they call it the isolation hospital.  People with these communicable diseases had to be there.  People like I say, people were, I might see one person 
two beds away from me, and next time, he passed away.  So that was a bad experience for me, seeing these\'85
\par \tab JF:  You were a child.
\par \tab HB:  Sure, I was 12, 13, I was 12 and that was a bad experience for me.
\par \tab JF:  Were you\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, 12, 13, maybe I was 14 years, 14.
\par \tab JF:  Were you scared about what would happen to you with the diseases?
\par \tab HB:  Not really, because I know I was being inoculated.  See the reason why so many Chinese died, they disregarded the inoculation.  It was initiated by the Japanese, to be ino
culated.  Although the Chinese didn't care, you know, just didn't go for it.  So what is the consequence of, if they acquired disease, then there wasn't a chance to survive it.
\par \tab JF:  Did the Japanese make the inoculations available to the community?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  At no cost?
\par \tab HB:  At no cost, right.
\par \tab JF:  But it was just a matter of whether they decided to follow through on it.
\par \tab HB:  Decided, yes, exactly, yeah.  No, it was mandatory to be inoculated, but then who can control mandatory Chinese.  [unclear] So\'85
\par \tab JF:  What was the experience like in the other hospital?  You said you had gone to the refugee hospital.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, well I wasn't stay there too long, with just malaria.
\par \tab JF:  And that's when you got the vaccine from Dr. Wolff?
\par \tab HB:  Whether there or not, I do not remember.  Maybe I got it there, maybe I got it at home.  I do not remember, yeah.  But evidently I know that certain, that vaccine I got.
\par \tab JF:  Did you know of any family members, did you have the experience with family or with friends who died from the illnesses or any other causes?
\par \tab HB:  No, not family members but I've, there was a refugee, I don't know his name--two beds away from me, and he passed away.
\par \tab JF:  This was in the\'85
\par \tab HB:  And he talked to the Chinese nurses in German, so they would understand him, so he was already--so, unfortunate individual, I mean very\'85
\par \tab JF:  Now this was in the isolation hospital?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, it was in isolation hospital.
\par \tab JF:  And he died\'85
\par \tab HB:  I never experienced any bad effect in the other hospital, no.
\par \tab JF:  When the war started, how did you know?  How did you find out?
\par \tab HB:  Pearl Harbor?
\par \tab JF:  Umm.  Hmmm.
\par \tab HB:  Well, it was in the paper.  We had our Shanghai Jewish Chronicle.
\par \tab JF:  And that's how you found out.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, sure.
\par \tab JF:  And what was\'85
\par \tab HB:  During the war, to tell you the truth, instead of seeking shelter, when the B-29's flew over Shanghai to bomb Japan, my cousin and I--all these houses had roofs, like flat roofs.  We went up the roofs and watched it.  Never went to a shelter.

\par \tab JF:  Watched them fly.
\par \tab HB:  Fly--and most humorous account which I was, we had a marine school that was behind our house.  There was a Japanese marine school, and they tried to get these planes with rifles.  People were killed more by shrapnel than by, by 
anti-aircraft, you know by shrapnel than bombs.  Well, as you recall, you probably heard from somebody else, there was one day, I think it was July 17, 1945, before the war, we were bombed and then [tape two, side one ended]

  That was heavily damaged, this building.  People lived there.  It was not a camp like the Ward Road Camp or the--we used to play around. We used to play there quite often.  We were kids.  And we stuck plenty--we
 became alienated from the time of the bombing, you know.  We were evacuated.
\par \tab JF:  You became alienated?\'85
\par \tab HB:  Alienated in respect to, we had the same friends that always met there, you know that just, and then somehow we became dispersed, we were dispe
rsed after, because we were going in different directions.  I don't know why.  I have no explanation why.
\par \tab JF:  Your experience meant that you had to separate.
\par \tab HB:  We had to separate, yeah, because we were evacuated, we put--that particular place was heavily bombed, was heavily damaged.  The, our house where we lived was not shockproof anymore, so we were evacuated temporarily to the Kadoorie School.

\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Which was in bungalows.  They had built bungalows.
\par \tab JF:  Where, the Kadoorie}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 School where you had gone.
\par \tab HB:   Yeah.  Now the first\'85
\par \tab JF:  The one you had attended as a younger child.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, as a younger child.  I was 15 then.  Excuse me--and the--so we were evacuated to the Kadoorie School because there were these bungalows.  So we lived there just like the }{\i\fs24 Heimes}{\fs24 
 and bunk beds.  So I had experienced too, how it feels to live not in a house but in a community-type, it was exactly like the way we lived in these }{\i\fs24 Heimes}{\fs24 , these camps.
\par \tab JF:  So what was that experience like for you?
\par \tab HB:  For m
e, it was exciting [laughter].  I don't know, it was different.  We had a big courtyard, a big yard, and you know, we had bungalows, a big yard.  The most, so, but the adverse experience, of course I had was the bodies that we found. They pile them up jus
t
 like wood, the Chinese.  And I think we lost 30 some or 40 refugees, and they are 300 over [unclear], you know.  And they had all the marine school that was behind us was damaged, too.  That's why our house was kind of not shockproof anymore. So then, al
l of a sudden capitulation came, and the day of the, when Japan capitulated,}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 
we had an aircraft flying low over the Kadoorie School and dropping leaflets with the signature of General Wiedmeyer.  I think he thought it was a POW camp.  I think the plane, he 
did not probably realize it was just us, humble refugees.  And it says, "Don't despair," I remember that, "Don't despair, the American forces will be coming your way," blah, blah, blah.
\par \tab JF:  How did that hit you?
\par \tab HB:  That, I was kind of aware of what wa
s happening.  OK, now take this scenario here.  OK, around the Kadoorie school, there were ammunition dumps, and I've seen it, I still see it.  I know people who remember it.  I see the Japanese soldiers guarding these ammunition dumps with fixed bayonets
 
yet.  Now the war was over the day of the capitulation, and they were guarding these ammunition dumps, it would be.  If they would not have guarded ammunition with Chinese going in there, it would have been devastation.  Chinese were throwing crackers, yo
u
 know their firecrackers.  That was their New Year's, Chinese New Year's.  They like the firecrackers--but here that was a risk that they did, because here was still armed Japanese.  But they didn't harm them, so that same day, the day after the capitulat
i
on, some, I think they were the first servicemen that came to the shores of Shanghai, all of a sudden I seen big fellows, I think they must have been Swedes, and they were the flyers of the--and they were coming to apologize to some of the people, who wer
e
 wounded, and I never forget this in my life.  If I would have had at that time a camcorder, that would have been something, or a camera.  A fellow, one of our refugees, had an American flag hidden all through the war years.  Raised up the American flag a
nd us kids, we were 15, you know, and we sang }{\i\fs24 God Bless America}{\fs24 
.  I can still feel the tears coming in my eyes.  That was such an emotional day--unbelievable, unbelievable, and so then they went around all these companies, bungalows, and introduced themselves.  I never met them personally.
\par \tab JF:  These were Swedes and Americans\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, I am saying they were like Swedes, I'm just making a comment.  I don't know what, I don't know what\'85
\par \tab JF:  They were--oh they looked, Ok, they were American troops? 
\par \tab HB:  Of course.
\par \tab JF:  They were definitely American troops?
\par \tab HB:  American flyers.  American Air Force people.
\par \tab JF:  During the war, how did you perceive what was going on?  What, how did it change you?
\par \tab HB:  I, the feeling of the war, I, did I mention earlier that I worked in this jewelry store?
\par \tab JF:  You had started to talk about that.
\par \tab HB:  I was working in this jewelry store as an apprentice and I was going to }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24  in the afternoon, or late i
n the evening, and it was damaged during the war, I mean during this bomb raid.  But before that, we had to build, we had to, I helped my boss, well I can't think, what do you call it when, bunkers, not bunkers.
\par \tab JF: A bomb shelter?
\par \tab HB:  Bomb, not bomb shelter.  Excuse me.  There were troops going to the hole, fox holes like.  Like a fox hole.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Ok, so they went, what Japanese expected was street fighting actually.  That was in 1944, late 1944.  And they expected street fighting, so we had to make their fox holes for them.
\par \tab JF:  They expected street fighting with the Allied troops.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah or with the Chinese, or with the Allied troops, who knows.  And we had to\'85
\par \tab JF:  You built the fox holes.
\par \tab HB:  Fox holes for them and each store had a fox hole, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  What were the Japanese like towards you?
\par \tab HB:  To me?
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  Here, my boss had his main clienteles were Japanese and religious people.
\par \tab JF:  Religious Jews?
\par \tab HB:  Religious Jews.
\par \tab JF:  And Japanese?
\par \tab HB:  And Japanese.  Japa
nese colonels came and bought watches, and short colonels came, Japanese soldiers, you know colonels, captains, I don't know.  They showed pictures of their wives in Japan.  You know, it's very strange, never felt that the animosity that--I never felt any
 animosity, I'm sure they--my dad, I mean his boss really was Japanese.
\par \tab JF:  And so your family did not experience\'85
\par \tab HB:  He had, never ever experienced any except when he had to go to get the special pass from, in order to go to work for this Mr. Ghoya.
\par \tab JF:  Yes, what was that like?
\par \tab HB:  Well he, I never went, well I did go to, I seeked a pass to go somewhere to be an apprentice in a prosthesis factory, a prosthesis.
\par \tab JF:  To make prostheses?
\par \tab HB:  That would have been a good thing, but then somehow it didn't work out. 
\par \tab JF:  OK.
\par \tab HB:  So it didn't work out.
\par \tab JF:  But the\'85
\par \tab HB:  So but then\'85
\par \tab JF:  That was the day you needed to get a pass to go there.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah.  That was the day, and I think they were Germans.  See, that's why
 they could be outside; they were in a French Concession.  I had to work with a French Concession [unclear].  That was their business.  And after the war, well I'll tell you then.
\par \tab JF:  But did you meet Ghoya that day?
\par \tab HB:  I, no, no.  It was his partner Kubota.  Ever heard of him?
\par \tab JF:  And was that different?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, Kubota was a different individual altogether.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  I've heard that now and I've heard different stories since yesterday.  I heard that Kubota was a fellow that gave out the pa
sses just like that, without any--and I heard later on that he was an American counterspy.  So, now then I hear that Ghoya was an American counterspy and he didn't have any choice but to show authority, or humiliation against the refugees.  Now I don't kn
ow.  I\'85
\par \tab JF:  You heard this when?
\par \tab HB:  Just yesterday.
\par \tab JF:  Oh, just yesterday.
\par \tab HB:  But I have, I don't know.  I don't know.
\par \tab JF:  Your father though had experiences with Ghoya.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah but he had a lengthy pass but he didn't have to go there everyday.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  You know, he had a lengthy pass to go to his place of employment.
\par \tab JF:  By and large, when you were working in the jewelry store, you were inside the restricted area.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah inside, that was right.  All the shops, all th
e refugee shops, I mean you had a provision store, you had a leather goods store, you had--we had pretty well self-sufficient stores.  I mean, you know they were all refugees, and I met a lady downstairs and by coincidence, I knew their, her parents had a
 
leather goods store next to the jewelry store.  I met them in Santa Monica.  I'd never met this lady.  She's about ten years younger than I am.  A shudder came to me and I stayed over at their house in Santa Monica by coincidence because I met them in a b
u
s.  I was taking, I had three days off from my work, you know, and I intended to go to the beach by myself and do a little strolling, walking down the beach, and I ended up in Santa Monica with her parents, and I stayed overnight there, never did do the b
each.
\par \tab JF:  Too much to talk about.
\par \tab HB:  Too much, yeah real bad.  They had a button store in Santa Monica.
\par \tab JF:  Now when you talk about this exhilaration when the war ended, when you saw the American troops\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.  Well, the American, well the American troops I seen later on, fewer maybe a few.  First the Chinese troops came in, the Nationalists, the Chinese troops came in, occupied Shanghai.
\par \tab JF:  And what was that like?
\par \tab HB:  They were poor looking soldiers with straw boots and straw, I don't know
 how in the world they survived on the battlefield, very poor equipped soldiers, World War II, World War I cannons.  All the Japanese had World War I cannons too.  Then later on, little by little, the Navy came in and the Armed Forces came in.  Then of co
urse my dad did work for the Armed Forces as a carpenter, I think it was.
\par \tab JF:  And that might be where he got the American money, you said\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, it could be, could be, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  The experience after the war in terms of deciding or trying to make plans to leave, do you recall that?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, sure.  Well, we went through HIAS, and HIAS, my dad was lucky because he had the German quota.  At that time they go, went by quota sys
tems.  I guess they still do today, I imagine.   And people from Austria, they were not so lucky.  They had to seek refuge, I mean they had to seek other places to go, because the United States would not take any people from Austria.  See, my cousin that 
was married in Shanghai, her husband was Austrian, so he couldn't come to the United States.  So he went to Australia, Australia.  Now my cousin, her brother, came to the United States.
\par \tab JF:  Your friend, the cousin who you\'85
\par \tab HB:  My cousin, the her.
\par \tab JF:  The male cousin\'85
\par \tab HB:  Male cousin.
\par \tab JF:  \'85That you were good friends with.\tab 
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, he came.  Now he joined the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 .  I mean he was in the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24  and the whole, the complete }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24  went to Canada first, and then they came to the United States.
\par \tab JF:  This is the }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Yeshiva}{\fs24 ?
\par \tab HB:  The }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Yeshiva}{\fs24 .  I'll tell you another, that was a remarkable story.  Just take this scenario, the }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Yeshiva}{\fs24 
, they were ready to leave Shanghai.  They were on the boat and the rest of the secular people, I mean the, oh there were a lot of these from the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 , the teachers from the }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 
 and the Lubavitchers, a lot of the Lubavitcher people were, there were a mixture of the Lubavitcher and the Lubliner people.  See they never starved, these Lubliners, the Lubavitcher.
\par \tab JF:  How did you understand that they didn't starve?
\par \tab HB:  Because I was there.  I mean I did\'85
\par \tab JF:  You just, you observed them.
\par \tab HB:  They had, they were observed, yeah, because I went.
\par \tab JF:  You watched them?
\par \tab HB:  I ate with them.  I dined with them.  I\'85
\par \tab JF:  How do you understand that that\'85
\par \tab HB:  Well, the thing, the only thing that the Rus--Orthodox Russian Jews support them, and that's the only solution I have.  If you become religious, you were pretty well off.  If you rem
ained unobservant, you were losers, so to speak.  I, it sounds not too fair that way but\'85
\par \tab JF:  So when you talk about the Lubliners, you're talking about the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 \'85
\par \tab HB:  There were just a handful of them.
\par \tab JF:  \'85from the big }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24  in Lublin.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Well, they came from there years ago\'85
\par \tab JF:  Originally.
\par \tab HB:  Also the Lubavitch, some of the Lubavitch, they came from, they were from Lithuania also.  I think that's where the Lubavitch came from originally.  Mir, Mir were more modern Orthodox.  They were not }{\i\fs24 chasidims}{\fs24 
, they were called }{\i\fs24 misnageds}{\fs24 .
\par \tab JF:  The }{\i\fs24 misnagdim}{\fs24 .
\par \tab HB:  The }{\i\fs24 misnagdim}{\fs24  [also called }{\i\fs24 Mitnagdim}{\fs24 ; opponents of the }{\i\fs24 chasidim}{\fs24 ].
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.  
\par \tab HB:  So, but they were, of course, religious.  See they were more maybe learned, or they took their studies very seriously, whereas the }{\i\fs24 chasidims}{\fs24 
 and the Lubavitcher were more of the spiritual--dance a lot, sang a lot.  I don't say that about, they're very
, I'm sure they're very--studious.  I mean they know about--but, anyway, I was trying to get away from it.  See, I joined Toastmasters, and that's when I--my father's good for one story, go to the middle, and then go back to the first one.  So take, so he
re were the people from the }{\i\fs24 Mir}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Yeshiva}{\fs24 
 up there, my cousin was there.  And here, we were the rest of us.  Now can you picture this turmoil on this wharf, you know, people you know, rickshaws, and what have you.  We started out to sing }{\i\fs24 Ani Ma'amin}{\fs24 .}{\fs24\super 5{\footnote

\par \tab JF:  }{\i\fs24 Ani Ma'amin}{\fs24 ?
\par \tab HB:  }{\i\fs24 Ani Ma'min}{\fs24 
, you could have hear a pin drop.  Like a miracle!  You could've hear a pin drop.  They started it, we started it.  That was something else.  So that was one of these highlights of Shanghai that I never will forget.  You know the one where they raised the
 American flag, and singing }{\i\fs24 Ani Ma'amin}{\fs24  to the parting }{\i\fs24 yeshiva.
\par }{\fs24 \tab JF:  Now this--The }{\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva}{\fs24  left before you did?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, before, yeah.  They left maybe a year before we did.
\par \tab JF:  When did you leave?
\par \tab HB:  1947.
\par \tab JF:  And you came\'85
\par \tab HB:  Then we went to Minnesota.
\par \tab JF:  You came directly\'85
\par \tab HB:  Oh no, not directly but we [unclear] to San Francisco, see that's\'85
\par \tab JF:  You were able to go to the United States in 1947.
\par \tab HB:  Right, yeah.  So my, yeah that's another thing.  My first experi
ence in, my first luxury, there was no luxury in Shanghai, by no means.  But my first luxury, cause we had to--for one thing, you could not drink water from the faucet.  You had to drink water, you had to boil it first.  It was cheaper to buy boiled water
 
from the vendor, than  boiling water yourself.  Gas was too expensive then.  I never recalled doing, although we had gas, we never used the gas.  We used the charcoals. That's the only way of, cheapest way of doing.  So anyway, the first, so the first lux
u
ry I had, when we went on this ship called, former troop transporter, Marine Adder, I hit the water fountain and drank from the water fountain.  To me that was the biggest luxury in life.  Just to, we went back and forth.  Milk, same thing with milk, you 
know.  I came to San Francisco, I remember we bought milk from the store, you know, get milk from the store, in the refrigerator.  Now I don't drink enough milk.  I don't drink enough water.  But the things we take for granted, oh.
\par \tab JF:  During that time, did you have any information about what was going on in Europe?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, after the war, of course.  We had a special\'85
\par \tab JF:  No, during the war.
\par \tab HB:  No, not during the war.  I had no conception\'85
\par \tab JF:  You had no idea what was going on?
\par \tab HB:  No conception.  No conception, no.
\par \tab JF:  \'85 going on with Hitler or...
\par \tab HB:  The concentration camps.
\par \tab JF:  \'85the camps\'85
\par \tab HB:  Not to my knowledge.  Maybe my parents knew, but not to my knowledge.
\par \tab JF:  It wasn't discussed.
\par \tab HB:  It wasn't discussed, no
.  I don't think the news were, it was only in the Japanese Theater.  There was not too much of a, well, sure there was news of Europe, but never, I don't think there was, maybe somebody remembered here, but I sure didn't.  See I did my thing.  I went to 
}{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 .   I went to this and I worked in this jewelry store...
\par \tab JF:  And that was it.
\par \tab HB:  That was it.
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  And you know, we did }{\i\fs24 davening}{\fs24  [saying prayers] three times a day.  That was another little--this fellow was }{\i\fs24 shomer Shabbat}{\fs24  [Sabbath ob
servant], you know, Mr. Brenner, he was owner of the jewelry store, and so he was a little bit of a hypocrite, and here comes one of these rabbis from, I don't know whether he was a Lubavitcher, or he was and he bought something from me.  And it was late 
in the afternoon and he asked me--he used to call me Herschel, you know, can you speak Yiddish?  And he said in Yiddish, "}{\i\fs24 Herschel du hast shon gedavent Mincha}{\fs24 
? [Have you said the afternoon prayer?]  I said, no, I didn't.  He said, "Oh take your eyes off and }{\i\fs24 daven}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Mincha}{\fs24 ."  I know just to make me\'85
\par \tab JF:  To go, to }{\i\fs24 daven}{\fs24  and...
\par \tab HB:  }{\i\fs24 Mincha}{\fs24  in the afternoon, to show this fellow that he was strict with this; he never cared about every day.  He cared less whether I did }{\i\fs24 Mincha}{\fs24  every day, you know, who cares, but 
just because he was standing there buying some, intending to buy some merchandise.
\par \tab JF:  I see.
\par \tab HB:  He was standing to the other room\'85
\par \tab JF:  So you did speak Yiddish?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, that's how we learned in }{\i\fs24 cheder}{\fs24 , in }{\i\fs24 yeshiva}{\fs24 .
\par \tab JF:  You didn't, not from Germany.
\par \tab HB:  Not from Germany, oh no, no.
\par \tab JF:  And your family did not speak Yiddish.
\par \tab HB:  No, no of course not.
\par \tab JF:  But the }{\i\fs24 yeshiva\'85}{\fs24 
\par \tab HB:  The }{\i\fs24 yeshiva, }{\fs24 that's how we learned.  It was humorous to see some, well some students when they have to give a lec
ture or you know, an essay of some sort, a lecture of some kind, of what we learned, we spoke in a very High German.  Some people could not adapt to the Yiddish.  It was, we were laughing at them, because we were, we were speaking with High German.  But l
ike I said, I did have a grand time there, all through the years.  I never had any regrets, never.  I wish I could go back sometimes, you know.  A lot of people went back there, too, but it was one of my best years, without reservations.
\par \tab JF:  What do you think about that, affected the rest of your life?
\par \tab HB:  The rest of my life?  Being, well there was always a rub-off of Judaism.  I was thankful.  And indirectly, which I didn't mention before, indirectly I have to thank Mr. Sugihara for my higher learning in Judaism, because due to him the }{
\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva}{\fs24  came to the, came to, well, they went to Kobe, then they went to, I have his book by the way.  I bought his book.  His son is lecturing all over the United States.
\par \tab JF: Yes.  
\par \tab HB:  And\'85
\par \tab JF:  So thanks to Sugihara, you got the Jewish education that you got.
\par \tab HB:  A real Jewish education.  A real Jewish education.  And they were pushing, these people were pushing me toward this education, you know, and despite the Russian Jews were, you kno
w, religious people.  Rabbi, Chief Rabbi was Russian.  He was Rabbi Ashkenazi.  He was this chief Rabbi, and so, but you know, but they did not mix too much in this, in the ghetto, the ghetto area.  But, you know--but it was through them, it's obvious, }{
\i\fs24 Mir Yeshiva }{\fs24 was there.
\par \tab JF:  This was the most significant piece\'85
\par \tab HB:  The most significant, yeah.  I would say the most significant aspect of, that's why I am a cantor now.  I'm a cantor in Sun City, California.
\par \tab JF:  So you studied here, or you\'85
\par \tab HB:  No, I said, I remember, I remember\'85
\par \tab JF: \'85was from your learning there\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, I to conduct services there, I primarily learned from Shanghai.  Now there are certain prayers that as a matter of fact, when I was hired, so to speak, I was working, and then 
I did this part-time.  I went down to Fairfax Avenue, you know where that is in Los Angeles?  I bought a training, cantorial training records.
\par \tab JF:  Ok [chuckle].
\par \tab HB:  That was 22 years ago, and I'm there 22 years in that Congregation.  And I don't have a
ny [unclear] so I made a tape, on 78 records I made it, you know, cassette tapes, and then it came back more or less.  I had the biggest, the scariest part was the }{\i\fs24 Kol Nidre}{\fs24 
.  I want to have it, make it perfect, you know.  So I even took Perry Como's rendition of }{\i\fs24 Kol Nidre}{\fs24 , that's a pretty good rendition and, actually I took it between him and between another cantor on that record, so, I did ok.
\par \tab JF:  Is there anything else you would like to add, before we stop?
\par \tab HB:  Well, I never had any remorse being the
re.  To me, it was an exciting time and it was, we had, it was, I only can't speak for my parents, they're the ones that lived in anxiety, didn't know about the results of this, hadn't even heard of this doctor so called, Meisinger that came, and from the
 
Butcher of Warsaw, wasn't it, and tried to annihilate us.  But the bottom line, the biggest irony is--you couldn't say that the Japanese rule was an antisemitic rule, because the simple reason, the Russian Jews lived outside the ghetto, like free people. 
 
The Iraqian Jews were in turn like with the rest of the internees and were treated the same way, not as Jews.  So we were the so-called stateless refugees, which were primarily Jews.  In order, in my evaluation, in order to pacify the Germans, the Japanes
e had to do something.  Remember the }{\i\fs24 Fiddler on the Roof}{\fs24 
, in order to pacify the Czar they made this disturbance during the wedding.  The same thing.  And so I never, I myself never had any animosity against the Japanese.  Now my cousin that lived here in P
hiladelphia, they wouldn't even, I don't think now, I don't know how the attitude changed, but they wouldn't buy a Japanese car.  People had bad experiences with some Japanese people and so is war, I mean, you know.  The Marines did bad things to the Japa
nese, too, I mean, but again, I mean, there is no comparison.  The Bataan march, I mean the atrocities that they did.  I seen atrocities against the Chinese, when I was there before the war, before the, no, before the American war.
\par \tab JF:  You saw this?
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, you know they hit the Chinese, [unclear] you know, then we had these, I don't know whether I mentioned this already or not, we had a French }{\i\fs24 gendarme}{\fs24 , and a Japanese }{\i\fs24 gendarme}{\fs24 
, and an American soldier, and a British soldier guarding the guard bridge, 
and, of course, the Chinese, when they crossed over, they had to bow to the Japanese, and in case they didn't bow then they would butt the rifles.  I've seen that, so they treated the Chinese very badly, you know. That's the only time I, but I didn
\rquote t see s
evere atrocities, and beggars, that was a common sight.  And a common sight during the wintertime, not our people, but the refugees and the Chinese used to pick them up like a garbage collector on a pitch fork, I've seen that.  That's the only thing that 
kind of\'85

\par \tab JF:  This is Tape three, Side one, of an interview with Mr. Herbert Broh.
\par \tab HB:  I said that--I started to say what I've lear
ned and what my reaction was living in China, if there was any aftereffects, did it affect me in later years?  No, it didn't, but I've learned lessons, many lessons.  One lesson I mentioned is that human life was, there was no value in human life, primari
ly among the Chinese people in those days and\'85
\par \tab JF:  You mean the, when you said there was no value, you mean this is how the Japanese perceived it or the Chinese?
\par \tab HB:  Well, among themselves even, among the Chinese themselves there was no, the Japanese ha
d at least made it mandatory that the Chinese were inoculated in order to, not to spread disease, but the Chinese would never had done that, and so--survival was, of Chinese beggars, the ones that couldn't make it, survival was on the minimum, and of thin
g
s that is in my mind again, is that the starving Chinese people were, especially among the beggars, they died on the street and they--even the people that were not beggars, had the infants, they wrapped them around and let them freeze to death, or maybe t
h
ey were dead already in their straw mats, and I've seen that, and I could not, well I could not figure out why, and at the end of a week or so, then a truck came and they had pitchforks.  They picked up those corpses like garbage cans, I mean like garbage
 collectors.  Now that sticks in my mind, yes, but it did not affect me per se.
\par \tab JF:  But it's something that you remembered.
\par \tab HB:  Something I, something that I remember.  Of course, the primitive living that we lived during the time, I remember, when we did not have all the luxury we had in our first house, of course.  But again, we survived that.  It was no problem.

\par \tab JF:  You mentioned before about Mr. Meisinger\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, I had no inkling about that until after the war.
\par \tab JF:  What was your understanding of what that was all about?  How do you understand?  How did you understand it at the time?
\par \tab HB:  Well, that was already after the war and you know, because I guess he was, according to the paper then, they described all th
e Treblinka camps, and they had a whole series in our local paper and all, and I could not believe that the Japanese would do that, would annihilate the Jewish population, including the Russian Jews.
\par \tab JF:  When you were aware when he came to Shanghai?
\par \tab HB:  I was not aware, no.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  I was not aware.
\par \tab JF:  So were you aware that there was some talk about whether or not there was a plan?
\par \tab HB:  Nah ah, no I have, until after the war I've learned it.  I learned it after the war.
\par \tab JF:  And\'85
\par \tab HB:  As a matter of fact, I did not learn it after I came to the United States.
\par \tab JF:  And when you learned it, how was it described to you?  Was it described as an actual plan to annihilate the Jews in Shanghai...
\par \tab HB:  That's right.  That's right.
\par \tab JF:  Or that it was a hoax?
\par \tab HB:  No, no.  I thought it was a hoax, but they were, the rumors were, I don't know, I cannot confirm that, that they were starting to build already preparation for a concentration camp.
\par \tab JF:  This is what you  heard?
\par \tab HB:  That's what I heard, yeah.  I cannot confirm or deny either that they was starting to, and then miraculously the, I guess the atom bomb was bombed and the war was over.  Now\'85
\par \tab JF:  And then in the concentration camp was to be a death camp or\'85
\par \tab HB:  A death camp, yeah.\tab 
\par \tab JF:  It was to be a death camp?
\par \tab HB:  It was supposed to be a death camp, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  So your understanding of it, was that there was an actual plan.
\par \tab HB:  A plan, exactly.  But, not I learned, not until even I came to the States and it wasn't, wasn't even discussed at Shanghai, some reason or another.
\par \tab JF:  You don't think your parents were aware of it or it was\'85
\par \tab HB:  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't know.  I never was discussed.  It never, I just heard it from other people.
\par \tab JF:  And then what stopped it was the fact that the war ended.
\par \tab HB:  That the war ended, yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.
\par \tab HB:  Now, I talked to a Russian woman here that came to this reunion, and she says 
that the plan was to annihilate all Jews, and, you know, and due to the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, she was saved.  I mean her life was saved.  I still kind of, I'm still in disbelief that this would have had happened, because my conception o
f the Japanese was that they respected religion because they, did you ever hear of the Amshenower}{\fs24\super 6{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\tab }{

\par \tab HB:  He was a

chneersohn is probably the Messiah, but that--anyway, I don't want to say\'85
\par \tab JF:  But this particular rebbe from the town of--can you spell the town?
\par \tab HB:  I only know that his, I cannot even spell it.  It's Abarron, Abba [phonetic], I just said it, Abrumshike [phonetic].  Oh G-d, I can't even spell it.  Abrumpshike [phonetic] whatever, Abrumpshire, Abrumpshire\'85 [phonetic]
\par \tab JF:  Ok, but he\'85
\par \tab HB:  \'85something like that\'85
\par \tab JF:  He was that special?
\par \tab HB:  You go back to the tape, I probably said it very clearly.  
But he was, yeah he was, right.  And as a matter of fact he was blessed.  He, my cousin that became a rabbi, was blessed by him.  I remember being, visiting us in that Ohel Moshe Synagogue.
\par \tab JF:  Yeah.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  Now when you came to the United States\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah.
\par \tab JF:  \'85You did not stay with the watch repair work\'85
\par \tab HB:  I did, I went, I worked for Jewel--Goodman Jewelers and tried to re-establish my, but I hated every minute of it.  Then I went to University of Minnesota for a year, and then I dropp
ed that.  Then finally I came, I was married there in Minnesota and went to, came to the United States.  I came to\'85
\par \tab JF:  LA?
\par \tab HB:  \'85Riverside, California, and then I worked for a company for 40 years in Quality Control.  I liked this job, and then I acqui
red this job as a cantor 22 years ago.  That's so, I'm still doing it and, by the way, you know, when we were sponsored, the way we came to the United States, we were sponsored by a pretend cousin of ours.  
\par \tab JF:  Ah!
\par \tab HB:  I don't know if you know that.  If you are aware of that.  
\par \tab JF:  A pretend cousin?
\par \tab HB:  A pretend cousin. In other words, a cousin, I forgot his name, but his family lived in Cleveland and supposed to be improvised cousin of ours sponsored\'85
\par \tab JF:  Did you know\'85
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, no.
\par \tab JF:  You knew of them.
\par \tab HB:  They were strangers, but you, in other words, the stipulation, the conditions was that we were not supposed to be in touch with.  In other words, they were sponsoring us, and that was it.  It was a pretend cousin in order, to quicker, 
to sponsor to come to the United States.
\par \tab JF:  Who organized that?
\par \tab HB:  The HIAS.
\par \tab JF:  This was through HIAS.  Ok.  And they were getting backers, anonymous backers\'85
\par \tab HB:  Backers, yeah, anonymous backers, yeah, right.
\par \tab JF:  Basically, so you never\'85
\par \tab HB:  But I thought they told us not to come in contact with them.
\par \tab JF:  And did you?
\par \tab HB:  No, we didn't.  We never had any reason to, any reason to.
\par \tab JF:  Ok.  Is there anything else that you want to add at this time?
\par \tab HB:  Well, I can't think of anything except the emotional aspect that I experienced in Shanghai, like I told you about, and I'd like to visit Shanghai sometime again.  I, well I have a little, I have friends, Chinese people now, that they are almost 
}{\i\fs24 mish-poche}{\fs24  [family] with me.  I'll tell yo
u why.  Met them in this, met them here, and I have a friend, my friend--I have a friend that I live with.  She always wanted these--let's put it this way, she was a friend of the family, and I am staying with her now.  Since I had heart surgery, I'm stay
i
ng with her, and she had a graduate student, that she rents out a room for a graduate student.  She lives right close by the University of California, of Southern, University of Riverside, Cali--Southern California, Riverside, U-C-R, and this Chinese, it 
h
appened to be a Chinese girl, and she was born in Shanghai, and she, her parents are still in Shanghai, and she graduated, and she, so there was a common bond between her and I.  We talked about streets and so on, and, unfortunately why I never learned to
 speak Chinese.  When I was in the Korean war, I would have had it made if I would have known Chinese.
\par \tab JF:  Oh.
\par \tab HB:  Because I would have been an interpreter then.  But unfortunately I never adopted that language, because we didn't need to.  We had our own language.
\par \tab JF:  You learned Yiddish.  [laughter]
\par \tab HB:  Between Yiddish, between Yiddish, German and English, you know. So [laughter], anyway, so she fell in love with a fellow from Taiwan, very unique, and they were married.  They have two kids now, and 
we were so-called, this lady and I, we were her adopted parents, so to speak.  On her wedding, we were invited to her wedding in Fremont, California.  So I, she asked me if I wanted to be the entertainer, because I play the musical saw.  This is carpenter
 
saw, and I play on my harmonica.  [laughter] So I did, and I--they want to hire somebody else, a fiddler or somebody, and then they, she heard me and she went, "Hey Herb, why don't you do this?"  So I did and I [unclear].  So I do double-talk, and I said 
w
ould they be offended if I would double talk Chinese, you know in a satire way.  So she said no, no, no, and the master of ceremony, who was her friend, I asked the same question and she said, no, go ahead.  So I did and what I've learned about China and 
S
hanghai and so on, so forth.  And I played some, I played a tune, a Chinese tune which I had no idea what I was playing because I just adopted the hearing, you know the sound, and would you believe that people, old-timers, were humming that tune.  I had n
o idea what I was playing.
\par \tab JF:  But it stayed with you?
\par \tab HB: It stayed with me, yeah.  So, anyway, I saw that there were not [unclear] this on their wedding.  He was, her husband worked for pharmaceutical.  He also went to UCR, and he works in statistics, 
a very good job for the pharmaceutical company.  So anyway, so they have, so they had a child.  They have two children now, and they called me Poppy, that child, and they called my friend Bubby, so, and anyhow, they, one of these days, I might marry this 
w
oman and who knows, you know, and now they have another child, and we are so close, so close.  So when, if I go to Shanghai, before, oh, she wanted to bring her parents to this country and she is, you know, she still wants to.  But I like to go there when
 they are still living in Shanghai.  I mean I have a good place to go, and they want, they had some pictures I want to show you.  They have some pictures that they took presently of Hongkew.
\par \tab JF:  That would be a wonderful way for you to go back?   Wouldn't it?  Yes.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, it would be.  Before they would come to this country, you know.  So that's--and I have, remarkably, we have so many Chinese--their friends, and it's coincidental that she prefers, that she had an American student now, but she prefers
 Asians.  Why?  Because they are just like family, because they don't have anybody here, and they are just like family, and all the Asians that she had in her rental, they all contact, they e-mail to her and everything.  They still contact with her.  That
'
s beautiful, so anyway it, China gave me a good optimistic, a good, not optimistic, but a good attitude and a good, not an adversity, by no means.  We've seen a lot of anguish, a lot of things that stay with you, of course, but personally I never regrette
d it and I would do it over again.
\par \tab JF:  Mr. Broh, thank you.
\par \tab HB:  Oh, you're welcome.  I\'85
\par \tab JF:  So much\'85
\par \tab HB:  I sometimes, I can't think.  You know, you want to say things that I can't express\'85
\par \tab JF:  You have said a great deal, and I thank you.
\par \tab HB:  Oh, you're welcome.  Thank you.
\par \tab JF:  This is an additional memory that Mr.Broh would like to add to his testimony.
\par \tab HB:  While I wanted to show Josey Fisher some Shanghai pictures, I came across a picture of my mother here, that, when she was working, and I 
forgot to mention this in the tapes.  She was working all through the war years for the kindergarten, used to be the Komor}{\fs24\super 8{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 
\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\tab }{\fs24\super 8}{  Paul Komor was a Shanghai businessman of Hungarian origin.}}}{\fs24  kindergarten.  I think Komor, I don't know, is he related to the Kado
ories or the Sassoon family somewhere?
\par \tab JF:  No, he worked with them, but he was separate.
\par \tab HB:  Oh, oh, he was separate.  Was he Iraqi also?  Was he an Iraqi Jew?  Was he\'85
\par \tab JF:  No, I don't believe he was.
\par \tab HB:  I don't remember.  I don't remember but anyhow it was Komor.
\par \tab JF:  K-O-M-O-R, I believe.
\par \tab HB:  K-O-M-O-R, yeah, and it's kindergarten, and as I can see, there are some ruins in the background, which was the ruins from the 1937 war with Japan, and this p
articular kindergarten was rebuilt.  It was in the backyard of the, I use to hang around there quite a few times, and this picture is with the staff.  And this is my mother. This here is my mother.  She was a cook in this kinder, in that particular kinder
garten.
\par \tab JF:  Now she was able to do this throughout the time\'85
\par \tab HB:  Throughout the war years, yes, yes.
\par \tab JF:  Because this\'85
\par \tab HB:  Just like the Kadoorie School existed during the war years, which, of course, all the English teachers, all the were British subjects, whoever can recall to\'85
\par \tab JF:  Because it was outside the ghetto?
\par \tab HB:  No, no, well, yeah, but no.  But this, no, that was within the ghetto.
\par \tab JF:  It was within the ghetto but it still functioned during the war.
\par \tab HB:  It still functioned, yeah.  B
ut no, the Kadoorie School, now there was some contradicting statements that was made yesterday.  Now, I'm not sure if the bungalows I mentioned in the tape were built after the proclamation.  I think, I think now, as I vaguely remember, because the origi
n
al Kadoorie School was in a big building, like any other school, any other high school, and I'm pretty sure we could, the continuation, the continuancy, I guess, of the Kadoorie School was that they build these bungalows, within the area, within the, beca
u
se somebody said, "No the Kadoorie School was outside the perimeter of the ghetto.  Then I said, "No, the Kadoorie School was within."  So I must have gone to the Kadoorie School before they built--funny, I do not remember that too well.  I only remember 
the bungalows.
\par \tab JF:  But it was the same school that you had gone to?
\par \tab HB:  The same school, exactly, exactly, the same school.
\par \tab JF:  The same school that you had gone to before you had to move into the\'85
\par \tab HB:  To move.
\par \tab JF:  \'85restricted area.
\par \tab HB:  Yeah, yeah, right, right.
\par \tab JF:   But both, the Komor School\'85
\par \tab HB:  So the same [unclear] this kindergarten existed, but that happened to be within the district anyway.
\par \tab JF:  Right.
\par \tab HB:  And yeah, so that existed.
\par \tab JF:  Wonderful.  Ok, thank you.
\par \tab HB:  You're welcome.
\par \tab JF:  Mr. Broh is going to describe one more photograph for us.
\par \tab HB:  This photograph that was sent by friends that I have in Shanghai, they're Chinese, and they photographed this memorial and there was, there's an inscription here, in Chinese, and in English, and in Hebrew.
\par \tab JF:  And this was erected by...
\par \tab HB:  By the Chinese government.
\par \tab JF:  By the Chinese government.
\par \tab HB:  And the description states, it's a [unclear] so I am going to try to, the best I can.  
"The designated area for stateless refugees from 1937 to 1941.  Thousands of Jews came to Shanghai, fleeing from Nazi persecution and Japan.  Japanese Occupation authorities regarded them as stateless refugees and set up this designated area to restrict t
h
eir residence and business.  The designated area was bordered on the west by Gonch Koping [phonetic] Road.  It says here G, it's a probably they changed the name, Kungpin Road on the east side of Topching [phonetic] Road and to the south of Hunning [phone
tic] Road and the north by the Zuet-si [phonetic] Road.  I don't know, I hope I pronounced that.  Hongkew District People, Government."  That's what it says, Hongkew District Government.
\par \tab JF:  Thank you.
\par \tab HB:  You're welcome.  [tape three ended]
