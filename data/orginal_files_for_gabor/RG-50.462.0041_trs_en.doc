\par SM:\tab I was born January the 6th, 1922 to a typical Jewish family in a small town in Poland.  The name of the city is Przasnysz, near the Prussian border.  As all Jewish children age four, I went to }{\i\f8 cheder}{\f8 
, learned all kind of Jewish studies, then went to a Jewish public school.  And after that to a Jewish high school, which was in an adjacent city, Mlawa.  The reason was that my father wanted me to know Hebrew and further Jewish education and culture.  I 
was a high school student when the war started, and since we were only twenty miles from the border, the German army occupied our city the next day.  But, a day before that, most of the Jews left the city.  Our family went to a neighbor\-ing city, Ciechan
\'f3w, where we had relatives.  My brother and myself, we went further, toward Warsaw.  Unfortunately, the German army preceded us.  It went faster than we could walk, and after a week we returned to our home in Przasnysz.
\par GS:\tab Excuse me, are you speaking of the entire family, your eight brothers and sisters, the parents, all returned?
\par SM:\tab 
Yes, all.  Only one sister was already in Israel at that time.  And one sister stayed in Warsaw.  She was in Warsaw and she was, since Warsaw was at that time encircled, she couldn't come home.  Several weeks after the war started, which probably made
 it toward the end of September, the German commander of the city ordered all Jews to come to the market.  He put us on trucks and he did not want to have any Jews left in that place.  He took us across the river Narew, where supposedly, t
hey was suppo-, where supposedly the border, the new border between Russia and Germany was supposed to be drawn.  Later, we were there a couple days, but later we had to leave on foot.  We were told to go toward the Russian border.  The atmosphere after w
e passed toward the part of Poland occupied by Russia was day and night.  In the Russian part we could, there were movies, we could, there was light, while in the other part, in the former part, was darkness.  We didn't have any electricity, and we were a
fr
aid to go out in the streets.  The whole family, except those which were moved, our family moved to Bialystok, but there was no place to live, because there were too many refugees there.  People, families, were occupying a corner of a room, in one room we
 were sleeping four, five, six families.  The Russians offered us to go to, into deep Russia, and find work there.  We waited, because a sister of mine was still in Warsaw.  One day, every day I was going to the train, waiting, hoping, that maybe she will
 r
eturn, she will come, she will find out that where we are.  And indeed this happened one day, because when Warsaw was taken, she came to look for us, and she heard what happened.  She organized a group of people in another city where my relatives were, an
d she came with them to Bialystok.  And I was standing at the train when she came out, stepped out from the train.  I, of course I was already planning and trying to find other people who will go with me, \lquote 
cause I did not want to go by myself, and try to bring them over.
\par GS:\tab During this time, it was not, was it possible for any students like yourself to attend classes?  Was there any school that you could go to?
\par SM:\tab Yes, the Russians organized schools, and I went to a Jewish school, interest\-
ing, the, but it was for me a little bit, how to, strange, because the language, the teaching language was Yiddish, while I was accustomed to having it in Polish and Hebrew. 
 But nevertheless, I attended, the few months which I was in Bialystok, I attended school.
\par GS:\tab Was it possible to attend synagogue in Bialystok at this time?
\par SM:\tab 
Oh yes.  But it was difficult to pray, because most of the, a lot of people were sleeping in the synagogue.  There was not enough place.  All synagogues were occupied by refugees.  After, about two months after my sister arrived, we all registered to 
go deep Russia, where, wherever it is, it will be.  We didn't know where they will send us, but to have, in order to have a place to, to live, to stay.  We were sent to the Ural mountains, on the b
order of Europe and Siberia.  And everybody about age 16 was supposed to work.  We were earning the wages of what, like what the same thing what the Russian people did earn.  They were trying to build apartment houses for miners who were develop-, who wer
e buil-, and other people develop-, who were trying to develop the wilderness of the Ural mountains.  Conditions were a little bit harsh, because we were supposed to work on construction \lquote 
til minus forty degrees. At minus forty-one we could go home.
\par GS:\tab What kind of clothing did you have?  Did you have warm enough clothing?
\par SM:\tab 
We did not have, but the Russian people often helped us.  They often gave us special warm clothes what they, what they had, and what we, wherever we could, we bought warmer clothing.  You cannot wear shoes there winter.  You have to have special, not 
made of leather, but boots made of felt.  Otherwise one freezes, and so on.
\par GS:\tab Did all of your family members have to work?
\par SM:\tab Yes.
\par GS:\tab Your brothers and sisters, and your parents?
\par SM:\tab Y
es, except my younger two brothers.  They were, they went to school.  I have learned to speak Russian after about couple months, and through the fact there was a young gentleman who was told from Warsaw, who was told by his father that he once had a broth
er in Minsk, and he had an old address there, where he used to write \lquote 
til 1920, '25.  And after that he received no letters.  So, he came to me and asked me to write for him a letter on the old address of his uncle.  And to his great surprise, he received a
nswer from a cousin who told him that he received the letter and asked him to come to Minsk.  We were hired to work in the Ural mountains for one year.  And indeed when the year was over, we were free to go wherever we wanted.  And this young man went bac
k to Minsk.  We did not know where to move.  We wanted to leave the Ural mountains, our family, because of the very harsh conditions.  My sister and brother-in-law\emdash my sister in the meantime married, met a young gentleman from Warsaw, they married
\emdash and they tried to go back to the eastern part of Poland since he had friends in, not far from Bialystok.  And he thought that there the conditions, at least climatic conditions, were much more reasonable.  Unfor\-
tunately, he was stopped at the border, at the former
 Polish-Russian border by the N.K.V.D. [Russian secret police], and told them they cannot go there.  So he remembered the friend for whom I used to write letters in Minsk, and they went to Minsk.  They found this man, and his cousin arranged for them an a
pa
rtment and a job.  Maybe for people who don't know, it would be, it should be explained that life in the, in Russia at that time, in the Soviet Union, in a large city like Minsk, Moscow, was different from the place where we were in the Ural mountains.  I
n Minsk you can go in, and buy eggs in a store.  You can go into a store and buy sugar.  In the Ural mountains, sugars were seen by the people three times a year, on the first of May, on the October Revolution, on the anniversary, and on New Year.  But in
 Minsk you could go in and buy.
\par GS:\tab Can you tell us a little about the living conditions other than this terribly cold climate?  What kind of housing did you live in?  What was the food situation other than this sugar shortage?
\par SM:\tab 
Each family had a room, so the whole family slept in one room.  The, and this is what I said, we were building houses so they wanted to develop it, and but obviously, initially, the nice apartments were given to the members of the party and engineers 
and so on.  And we were living in the older section.  But...
\par GS:\tab Were there many Jewish families there?
\par SM:\tab We came there about fifty Jewish families.  Previously there were no Russian Jewish families.  But we met there a couple Russian Jewish engineers.  They were very nice, tried to help us as much as possible.
\par GS:\tab What was the attitude of the non-Jewish people?
\par SM:\tab Oh very nice.  They tried to help us in as much as they could.  We were called there "the westerners" and they told us the suits which we had on, what we'll never see such 
a suit in Russia, that we should wear to work different clothes and they tried to help us as much as they could.  As a whole, I was left with very good, fine memories of the people.  Some of them were sent there because they said something against Stalin 
or they were previously land owners and were sent away.
\par GS:\tab So these people were being exiled from their homes.
\par SM:\tab So some of them were exiled, some had to live there\emdash they were free to move, but if they wanted to go, they had to go to the N.K.V.D. and rece
ive permission to, to, so it was as a whole, a place where people were sent away.  But there were also a lot of volunteers who came to, found work there, and lived there.
\par GS:\tab But generally you found that they were hospitable...
\par SM:\tab Very.
\par GS:\tab The Soviets were helpful?
\par SM:\tab Very, very, very helpful.  Very friendly.
\par GS:\tab Were you asked to register for Soviet citizenship?  Was that offered to you?
\par SM:\tab We received, we were not asked, we were told everybody is supposed to have a passport, and we had Russian passports.  Like any Russian, there is nationality written, nationality, we had written Jewish.
\par GS:\tab So you weren't given a choice as to whether you wanted to remain a Polish citizen?  You were just given the passport and made a Soviet citizen.
\par SM:\tab Passport, and that is that.  Right.
\par GS:\tab Did you ever think about going back, as your, was it your sister and brother-in-law?
\par SM:\tab They did, but they tried to go, it was still Poland.  It was still the Soviet Union but a part of Poland...
\par GS:\tab Oh, right.
\par SM:\tab Which they went to.
\par GS:\tab Right.  So they were not leaving the Soviet Union.
\par SM:\tab 
No, because if to leave it would have been to leave to Russia, to Germany, and, there was no comparison, because here it was cold, but you still could go to a, to a movie, and you, and there the libraries were open, and you could go read and, or trave
l.  I even went back, because my mother became sick, and we, and she stayed in a hospital in Bialystok, and then when she was all right, I went back and brought her to, no, to the Ural mountains.
\par GS:\tab You had this freedom of motion.
\par SM:\tab 
Oh yes, we could, yes, we could, we were not, we signed an agreement that we will work for this company one year.  And for this they paid our transportation.  And we were supposed to work, although we did not understand what we signed, but with everyb
ody signed, because everybody wanted to look for a place where to, to live.  So after the year was over, my sister and brother-in-law settled in Minsk.  And since we did not have enough money for everybody t
o go, so I was the next one who left to Minsk, because they described conditions were like day and night, the difference between Minsk and the Ural mountains where we lived.
\par GS:\tab During that year, that first year in the Soviet Union, did you have contact with any Jews in other cities, other parts of the Soviet Union, or in Poland?
\par SM:\tab No.
\par GS:\tab No, you had no contacts.
\par SM:\tab No.  The only contacts in other cities, other came in Minsk via this friend who worked and because I was his translator, or, I did write th
e letters for him and this is how they called me actually... and his cousin married a young, a Jewish officer in the army, who was able to arrange for these things.  In Russia you have to know the right people in order to be able to, to arrange certain th
ings.  And a lot of people want to live in large cities, but you cannot live in the large city unless you have a job.  And you cannot get a job unless you have, you live in the city.  So for, if somebody who wants from another place to come to a Minsk-lik
e,
 a city like Minsk, Kiev, or Moscow, or Leningrad, it's impossible.  Practically impossible, unless you know the right person who can arrange.  This cousin of, for whom, of this guy for whom I, to whom I wrote the letters, he was such a guy who knew to ar
range.  He arranged for his cousin to stay, after that for my sister and brother-in-law, and when I came, he arranged also for me to get a job so that I can stay.  But what I did not know is that the next war approaches.  I managed to come three weeks bef
ore the Germans attacked Russia.
\par GS:\tab So now two years have passed, now 1941?
\par SM:\tab Was a year-and-a-half, no, a half, like, because I did not move immediately.  It took time...
\par GS:\tab Right.
\par SM:\tab Because at first this guy from Warsaw moved and then my sister, and it took time \rquote 
til they became organized, and then they said, "Hey, the next one can come."  And so slowly we wanted the whole family to move out from the Ural mountains.  When the war started, we tried initially to walk toward, toward, toward Moscow, but i
t happened again after two or three days on the way that the German army was, we found the German army in front of us.  And we didn't have any other choice but to return, because we thought at least in Minsk is a large city, maybe we'll be able something 
to, somehow to survive.  The, about a month after the Russians... the Germans occupied Minsk, the ghetto was organized, and we moved in into the ghetto.  At that time my sister had also a little girl, so we were four people in one room.  We, initially, we
 c
ould go out to work.  We were getting food.  We were getting very little, but somehow we tried always to organize.  My brother-in-law and myself, we used to leave the ghetto and go, go out, into the Russian sector, into villages, bring food into the ghett
o.
\par GS:\tab How did you get past the guards?
\par SM:\tab This was relatively easy to do, because it was not like a ghetto, Minsk, in Warsaw where they made walls, built walls around it.  This was still made of, with wire, so we always carried pliers to cut the wires and
 then wherever we went, we left, we twisted them back, and it was not so difficult to leave.  The question was, when you leave, what do you do then?  After a short time, the so-called, we called it simply pogroms, started.  The Ukrainians and S.S. were co
ming, occupying a certain section of the ghetto.  There were about 120,000 Jews initially.  And they, they cleaned out 5,000, 6,000, took them out, and killed them.  We, after that even knew where they were taking them to shoot.
\par GS:\tab Were there particular people they were taking?  In other words were there people who were involved with, was there a }{\i\f8 Judenrat}{\f8 ?  A council?
\par SM:\tab There was a }{\i\f8 Judenrat}{\f8 .
\par GS:\tab And were the members of the council taken?  Or...
\par SM:\tab No, initially the members of the }{\i\f8 Judenrat}{\f8 ...
\par GS:\tab Just indiscriminate?
\par SM:\tab Indiscriminate, they just took a certain section.  And we had been, had we been in this, we would have disappeared, like the others.  When this happened, we started to build places to hide.  Also they were catching people to take to work, 
and we wanted, while we wanted to work, because by going out to work we could always organize something to bring food, to bring something into the ghetto, we wanted to choose where to work and not be taken to work.  So we built in our, in the room where w
e, where we lived, we built a double wall where we were hiding.  Whenever some of our neighbors used to wonder, how come that we used, everybody was trying to hide somewhere, and we were running fast into the house?  And then they saw Germans or Ukrainian
s 
going in, and not taking us.  They, they came in, looked, but they apparently did not know, we did not tell too many people except later we told our neighbors, that we had a double wall where we could hide.  When the Germans started to take women and chil
dren also in, for, for the so-called, these }{\i\f8 Aktionen}{\f8 
 they called, but it was, we called them, pogroms, then we built something different for my sister and her little girl, because little child was, it was dark between the two walls, and she was crying.  So 
we built something under the ground on the first floor, a deep opening.  I used to let them in, them means my sister, brother-in-law, with their child, and then I used to go back and hide in the double wall.  We survived like this for about a year, but we
 saw that we cannot, it will not, we cannot, the ghetto became smaller and smaller.  They brought in Jews from Hamburg, from Germany, and slowly killing them too.  We decided we have to escape, go away.  We tried to look for contact with people who were f
ighting the Germans, and finally we did reach.  We were hiding in our place somebody whom the German were searching for.  And in this way we wanted to go out into the forest and join the partisans.
\par GS:\tab This is now about one year later after...
\par SM:\tab About a year later, right.
\par GS:\tab The Nazis took over.
\par SM:\tab It was about a year-and-a-half.  We, but the problem was we could not leave a little child.  We couldn't go with a little child into the forest, into a forest where we did not know where we will be.  But, in a 
place where my brother-in-law and sister worked was a decent German soldier, who tried as much as possible to help us.  We asked him if he can find a place for the child, in a, in a orphanage home.  And he arranged it.
\par GS:\tab How old was this child?
\par SM:\tab 
Two years.  We taught her a Russian name and this soldier took her and after that for some time he was taking my sister out to see, to see her, but not close so that they will not, that she will not see her, see them.  Actually, we did it because ther
e was one 
pogrom four days long where all not working women and children were killed.  My sister did hide into, in the place where we had made, so she survived it, and after that, this child was the only child in ghetto.  And we, so this was the reason we decided e
ither we'll all die, or we have to do something, arrange some place for the child to be.  About a month after the child was, was accepted by, in this orphanage, we left.  I joined a partisan group which was about twenty people.  My sister and brother-in-l
aw were in another, in another group.
\par GS:\tab Excuse me, were these Jewish, or non-Jewish?
\par SM:\tab Mostly non-Jewish.  There were some Jews, but,...
\par GS:\tab And they accepted you?  What was the attitude of the people in these partisan groups?
\par SM:\tab Oh these groups were, accepted us without,...
\par GS:\tab Fully.
\par SM:\tab Fully, obviously, there were cases of antisemitism, there is no doubt about it, but there were many Jews in the, in the partisans.  As a matter of fact, in the group where, which I came to, there were initially twenty 
people.  Actually I left this group and went to another one which was larger.  And there were a number of Jews.  The person who organ\-
ized all the, or maybe, let me talk what did we do? What was our objective? Most of it was not to fight the German army, 
but German communication.  We were blowing up bridges, blowing up trains.  This was the main thing.  And the guy who organized all this blowing was a Jewish lieutenant.  Unfortunately he did not survive.
\par GS:\tab When you say lieutenant, had he been in the army?
\par SM:\tab He was in a, he was...
\par GS:\tab So he...
\par SM:\tab A Russian...
\par GS:\tab Russian army.
\par SM:\tab He was a Russian in the Russian army, and,...
\par GS:\tab But he worked with the partisans?
\par SM:\tab But he was the, instead of during the, during, at certain fight he was wounded, left, he did not want to, was surrounded, he did not want to go into captivity.  He escaped and then joined. Most o
f the partisans were former soldiers.  Some of them were leaders of the Communist local government who were afraid that they will be killed by the, taken, and slowly also local people started to join.
\par GS:\tab Were you the only Polish people?
\par SM:\tab 
No, after that there were two more, two more.  In other way, local people.  There were several people who were hidden in the forest, and they, they were doing, one was a shoemaker, and we were going to him and after that he joined to, to, to give him 
some work, and afte
r that we told him, "C'mon, join us."  So he became also a partisan.  He was a local guy from a nearby village who escaped with a family and lived.  He built himself a hut in the forest, and since it was a big forest, the Germans were scared to go in ther
e.  And there were about 10,000 partisans in this forest.
\par GS:\tab Can you describe what your daily life was like?  What were your living conditions?
\par SM:\tab Oh, we moved from place to place initially.  After that when the movement, the partisan movement grew, we have like permanent, built permanent huts in the forest, with about...
\par GS:\tab Were there families with you?
\par SM:\tab Later, in our place were not...
\par GS:\tab Just men.
\par SM:\tab 
No families.  But, there were, there was a group of about 400 Jewish family people who were not far away, who escaped, and they were allowed, they lived under, so to say, the umbrella of the other partisans.  The, usually in the morning we're getting 
up like, either standing guard and so on, and each time from time to time we had to go to do something, 
to go blow up a train.  Usually it was done by about ten people.  Most of the bombs were homemade, devised by this Jewish lieutenant.  We didn't have enough ammunition.  We didn't have enough explosives.  It was later that Russian planes started to arrive
, land in our forest, bring ammunition and take the wounded back.  But initially everything was homemade.  Our initial bombs were simply large shells left from the Russian army when they were escaping when the Germans occupied.  We used to drill holes, pu
t there the, I don't know how it is called in English, from a hand grenade, the, the one which starts the explosion, put it in.
\par GS:\tab Material, or the...
\par SM:\tab Not the material.
\par GS:\tab Was it the pin?
\par SM:\tab Yes...
\par GS:\tab The pin that gets pulled?  The activator?
\par SM:\tab We used to open the pin, the part which has the, with the pin, we used to put it in into the, into the fifty...
\par GS:\tab Shell.
\par SM:\tab Pound shell or, we used, around the pin put a long string, and hide behind a tree.  When the train, put this under the rail, the rai
lroad.  When a train came, we pulled with the string.  We didn't have electric, like I see here in the movie.  We pulled the string, and the pin was, was out and it blew up.  We always chose a place where there is a certain, where it is high so that the e
xplosion was always blowing off the whole train down the, down a slope.  Initially we didn't need much explosive to put in, because the trains were going fast.  After that, the trains were going very slowly, or they saw, they thought in beginning that the
se
 are automatic, so they put two, three wagons of sand in front, the Germans.  But we didn't care whether because we did it manually.  Usually we tried to blow whether we saw fuel or people.  When the train started to go slowly, we had to make larger size 
bombs to put under the, under the railroad.
\par GS:\tab Was most of the planning, the strategy done by this Russian army lieutenant, or did you make decisions on your own?
\par SM:\tab No, this was, usually we said, you, this, there was a commander, and he was choosing for 
each time another, we were divided in groups of twenty people and from these twenty people each time another group had to go and blow up, try to blow up a train, train.  The terrain where to do it was always, we had local guys.  They knew the place, and t
hey knew the best, because not only was it important to blow up, it was also important to escape after that, not to, and not to lose people.  Because the objective was not, the most important for us was do something damage and run away alive, so that we c
an
 do, continue to work.  Later when we started to get contact with the Russian army, when we were started, and planes started to come and bring us TNT, it was easier and the objective changed.  Instead of blowing up trains, we started to blow up the railro
ad itself.  So we used to call it a concert.  We go to arrange a con-, for a concert, because we stopped going a small group, eight, ten people, but 200 people who went out to the railroad and the German, the Germans used to have every five miles they use
d 
to have posts.  But there used to be three, four, five people.  When they saw a bunch of 200 people running toward them, they used to escape.  And we used to divide into groups and I was usually the one who was putting the mines.  This was my job.  Blowin
g up certain things was my job always to do in our group.  So we used to then put in only 200 grams TNT under each trai... railroad.  And while we were walking behind us were going people with matches and lighting it, setting it off.  So it started to blo
w 
while we were still planting mines a little bit further up, and this is why we called it we go for a concert.  And usually such a thing was happening, we knew, when we went for a concert we knew that the next day the Russians will start an offensive.  And
 they wanted us to destroy the railroad so that no supply will come to the front.  As a matter of fact, we were all starting to move backwards into Poland each time when they came to Minsk, we were moved back toward Bialystok, to keep on doing this, blowi
ng
 up the railroads.  And soon they were running out of railroads, the trains, because if we blew up a train, one, they pushed this off and a half an hour later other trains could pass.  But if we blew up for two, three, five miles, all the, all four lines 
of the track, they didn't have enough rails to fix it.  Very often for a week or two weeks they was, they could not use the line.
\par GS:\tab You mentioned that a guard, a German guard seeing a large number, 200 people coming, would run away.  Were there ever large groups of soldiers sent knowing that, once you started to do this, did you ever encounter any large groups?
\par SM:\tab Oh yes, there were many.  We were several times encircled by the German and Ukrainian armies, 50,000, 100,000 soldiers used to be taken from the front and circled our, our place and they tried to, to destroy it.  They}{\b\f8  }{\f8 even}{\b\f8  }{
\f8 wrote, in}{\b\f8  }{\f8 one}{\b\f8  }{\f8 letter}{\b\f8  }{\f8 wrote}{\b\f8  }{\f8 the whole partisan movement destroyed and even the name of our commander was that he was dead.  I remember I showed it to my commander and said, "Oh 
Sam, go if so.  Next week go show that we are alive."  And they sent us to blow up a train. [laughs]
\par GS:\tab Ahhh...
\par SM:\tab So, something like this...
\par GS:\tab Do you remember the last name of that commander?
\par SM:\tab Commander?  Yeah, Zeitzer.
\par GS:\tab Zeitzer.
\par SM:\tab He was a Russian, but there were many Jewish, Jews not far away.  Actually more south in Polesha was a, I heard only stories about him, that,...

\par SM:\tab This gentleman was a legendary figure in the partisan movement.  He was called }{\i\f8 Dyadya Vanya}{\f8 .  And he was Jewish.  Today I remember, I used to know after that his name, his, but today I forgot.
\par GS:\tab This is the Uncle Vanya.
\par SM:\tab 
Yeah.  Then there was a group of, a Jewish partisan group.  Several hundred Jews from, they were from, mostly Vilna, Minsk, Bialystok, from this area.  And they were also in one of the, in one of the forests of White Russia.  I today forgot the name o
f their }{\i\f8 otryad}{\f8 
 [detachment], is in Russian the name of the group, of the partisan group.  Occasionally, on trips and on walking I used to meet Jewish people, and from time to time I used to get regards from my sister and brother-in-law.  My brother-in-law was wounded, 
and he was, and he and his sister were taken out by plane to, into Russia.
\par GS:\tab You said your sister and brother-in-law joined another partisan group, and both of them were working with this group.
\par SM:\tab Yeah.
\par GS:\tab That was a group, I would assume, that had both men and women, but the group you were in was all men?
\par SM:\tab No, there were women, too.
\par GS:\tab There were women also.

\par GS:\tab Right.  But, for the most part, single people, or some married, but...
\par SM:\tab Some married, but mostly single people.  Initially I was the youngest in my group, but after that a younger, a younger kid [laughs] came and,...
\par GS:\tab When you joined the part-, this is the first partisan group, how old were you? In '42?
\par SM:\tab Actually I was already, it was '42, so I was twenty.
\par GS:\tab Twenty.
\par SM:\tab But all, most of the people who were, were soldiers already.  They had been to the, to the army, so they were all older than I, than I was.
\par GS:\tab Older, right.  And then how long did you remain with that group?

Til 1944.  In 1944 it was a funny way how I met the Russian, the Russian, army.  We were told that, we saw, we read, I listened to the radio and sometimes also to foreign radios.  And we knew that the Russian occupied Minsk and the
y were going toward the forest or toward Bialystok.  And the question was, will we be able to survive, because we could not fight the German army when they retreated.  However, they somehow avoided the forest, mostly they were small groups.  The small gro
ups we were fighting.  And in one such case, we took about fifty or sixty German soldiers prisoner.  Initially, with prisoners we... we had to move from place to place.  We couldn't keep prisoners.  But this was already towards the end, and we were taking
 p
risoners toward our camp.  We had to pass a big road.  And I gave them order to lie down, and I told them if they'll, when we had to, when we had to pass the big road, we wented first out to see quiet.  And suddenly we heard the noise of tanks.  We were s
ure these were German tanks.  And I told the German soldiers if they'll move and yell, they'll be the first to get the bullets.  So they were all quiet.  And when we saw the tanks, were not Germans tanks, they were Russian tanks.  And then...
\par GS:\tab I have one question.  My question is, where did you get the ammunition, your weapons, and also where did you get your food?
\par SM:\tab 
Ammunition, initially we had from local people.  When the German-, when the Russian army retreated, they left huge amounts of ammunition in the forests.  And for some reason, the people didn't hide it.  We used to get from the people machine guns, eve
n all kinds of ammunition, from machine guns to even, no, }{\i\f8 pushki}{\f8  in Russian, cannons.  For some r
eason they were hiding them.  Whether they were thinking that maybe these will be for Poles, against, because this was in Poland, in a Polish part, or they wanted to have it as some kind of a bargain, we don't know.  But we were getting it from them.  Som
etimes we had to force, to take it by force.  When somebody told us that this and this guy has hidden a machine gun, we used to go away and tell him, "Listen, if you'll not give it to us, it means you are for the Germans.  Means we should kill you."  And 
obviously we did not kill anybody of them, but sometimes...
\par GS:\tab You persuaded them.
\par SM:\tab Persuaded, so such, [chuckling] this helped to get the ammunition.  Later...
\par GS:\tab And your food supply, how did you get that?
\par SM:\tab Food supplies we were taking, getting from the people.
\par GS:\tab They gave willingly?
\par SM:\tab Occasionally we told people, "You have to give," so-and-so and so on.  Later toward the war, we had in each village, there was a partisan who was in charge.  And when, and he used to say, "Oh, you two people go to
 this room to eat, and this, to this family and this family."  And the people, the local people where we lived, often, accepted us and I used to have already a house where always the lady always found something warm for me when I was hungry to eat.  So, a
nd we were going, there were always families of policemen from which we took away everything.  So, if we saw some kind, cows of, which belong to the Germans, we used to take it from them.  And also from time to time we took it from the people we know, if,
 we left each family, each farmer had at least one cow.  But if somebody had more than one...
\par GS:\tab They had to share.
\par SM:\tab They had to share.
\par GS:\tab Did the Germans ever come into the forest where you were here?
\par SM:\tab Oh yes, they tried, but they were all scared.  If they came, they came in a large, large number.
\par GS:\tab But not large enough to take over and to kill all of you partisans.
\par SM:\tab They, they, if they came, they were at two days, three days, four days.  We were retreating.
\par GS:\tab It was a large forest.
\par SM:\tab To fig
ht with them we only, we only, we tried to avoid fights, actually, because we did not have the type of ammunition they had.  But where we had to, we did fight.  As a whole, they were, the Germans were scared of the forest.  More difficult was with Ukraini
ans.  They were not as scared, and with them we had often fights, and most of the partisans killed were actually killed by Ukrainians, more by Ukrainians by, than by Germans.  We had also a lot of Ukrainians also in our side.  As a matter of fact my comma
nd
er was Ukrainian.  But still, they gave us a lot of trouble.  And when I said, the, I'll never forget the encounter with these Russian tanks, when they, they stopped when they saw, when we saw Russian tanks, they got out and they stopped.  They thought in
 beginning, hey, who are this?  And then, they, asked us, "Hey, who are you?"  I said, "We are partisans."  They started to kiss us and they saw the German soldiers, we were, we asked them, where, what to do with them.  So they told us to go to the next c
ity and where the army has a camp for them.  So we took them there and for the first time in two years I saw, I walked on asphalt.  I thought already sometimes in the forest, I thought, will I ever be able to walk on concrete?  On asphalt, and not on mud?

\par GS:\tab So at this time now it's '44.
\par SM:\tab This was, yes, '44.  And...
\par GS:\tab And you remained with the partisans until the end of the war?
\par SM:\tab Until the end.  In '45 I went into Russia to find my mother and I had there two brothers and sisters.
\par GS:\tab Where were they during that time?
\par SM:\tab They were still, still in...
\par GS:\tab Back in...
\par SM:\tab Back in the Ural Mountains.  At least...
\par GS:\tab Ural.  That was a safe place.
\par SM:\tab It was safe from point of view, yes.  They, they suffered hunger and various kind of deprivations, but this was the same thing what the whole Russian population went through.  At least\emdash 
they worried about us, they were sure that we are not alive, although with the first plane which landed in our, in partisans\emdash I sent a letter to them.  So this was, and I told the
m that my sister and brother-in-law are also alive, and so they knew after that that we are alive.  But still, it could happen every other day something could happen.  And later my sister and brother-in-law, when they were near Moscow, he was in a hospita
l there, and from there already they wrote letters so they knew that they survived.  And in '45 I went, picked up, it took some, it took several months to arrange all the papers.  It was '46 that my, the family left, moved back to Poland.  We were sent to
 Stettin [Szczecin].  No, we didn't, I went to the place where we, Przasnysz, where I was born.  I was there only a half an hour, and I could not, I couldn't stay, because it...
\par GS:\tab Nothing.  No life there.
\par SM:\tab No, no Jewish life.
\par GS:\tab You mentioned another place where the family went, in \lquote 46. Szczecin?
\par SM:\tab Oh, Szczecin.  This is, this is the part of, Szczecin is, was, is a, was once a German city which was, now is, was, Poland occupied it, take it.  Now it is Poland.  And the German population was sent out, a
nd they tried to Polanize it, and they sent also Jews who returned from the Soviet Union they sent there.  In Szczecin I got in contact with Zionists movement.
\par GS:\tab Szczecin, can you spell that name for me?
\par SM:\tab In English I believe it will be, S-T-E-, Stettin, S-T-E-T-T-I-N.  It is a large port.
\par GS:\tab You were there from '46...
\par SM:\tab From '46 to...
\par GS:\tab Or '45.
\par SM:\tab '46 to, \lquote til about '47.
\par GS:\tab A year.
\par SM:\tab Right.  I was approached there by a Zionist group.  They needed to arrange to send children, a train with chil
dren, a few hundred children, toward Krakow, so that they can take them out of Poland.  And they couldn't get a train.  They, as a former partisan I knew some people.  Can I, can I arrange it for them?  I arranged it, as long as, I told them if they will 
give me some people to help, to keep so many kids in,...
\par GS:\tab How many children?
\par SM:\tab About 200.
\par GS:\tab And how old were they?  Young children?
\par SM:\tab Young, from, eight to about, to fourteen, fifteen.
\par GS:\tab These were children who had been orphaned?
\par SM:\tab Orphaned and
 they, there was an orphanage home in, organized in Szczecin and they wanted to send them to Krakow. From Krakow they had a way to send them through Czechoslovakia, out of Poland.  I organized a train.  They couldn't get a train.  I said, "I'll get you a 
train!"  And they promised me that, but I told them I want something for it too, and this is, I want my family also to be able to move out from Szczecin to, to Germany at that time.  This was the only place where we could [unclear], because this was close
 t
o Germany.  And this was arranged.  I brought the children back, brought the children to Krakow and I returned, and a few months later I was told that there is a possibility to move, and we left.  Actually, not all.  Two of my sisters had to go another wa
y.  They went through Vienna.
\par GS:\tab How many of your family were able to leave?
\par SM:\tab Oh, it was my mother, two brothers, and myself.
\par GS:\tab Your father, died earlier?
\par SM:\tab My father, yeah.
\par GS:\tab Did he die of natural causes?
\par SM:\tab He, unfortunately he did not know that we survived.
\par GS:\tab So then you went to the West.
\par SM:\tab To the West, to Berlin.
\par GS:\tab To Berlin.
\par SM:\tab And in Berlin we stayed for some time, where I started to study in Berlin.
\par GS:\tab You went to the University?
\par SM:\tab To University, yeah.  And my two younger brothers volunteered when the wars in '48 started in Israel, they volunteered.  They went to fight the war.  I had enough wars.
\par GS:\tab When did you make the decision to come to the United States?
\par SM:\tab It was just before I got my Ph.D.  My mother was that time in Israel, and I went to visit them.  And I talked about, I am a chemist, and I talked about employment possibil\-ity, and I saw that it's not easy.
\par GS:\tab In Germany.
\par SM:\tab No, in Germany I didn't want to stay.
\par GS:\tab In Israel.
\par SM:\tab In Germany I wouldn't have, but in Israel there is not easy to get employment as a chemist.  In one place they told me \ldblquote }{\i\f8 Yesh lanu chimayim k\rquote mo zefet}{\f8 \rdblquote 
, which means we have chemists like tar, like plenty.  In other words, plenty, enough chemists.  Cannot find a job for them.  So that time I decided I'll go to United States.
\par GS:\tab But the others in your family did go to Israel?
\par SM:\tab Yes.
\par GS:\tab And remained?
\par SM:\tab I still have a brother and sister in Israel.  One brother.  And my older sister, who was with me in ghetto, she already was in United States.
\par GS:\tab Oh.  So you came to the United States then and completed your education?
\par SM:\tab No, I got my Ph.D...
\par GS:\tab Oh, you got your Ph.D...
\par SM:\tab In Germany.
\par GS:\tab In Germany.
\par SM:\tab And then I came here.
\par GS:\tab You mentioned the child of your sister who was placed in the orphanage.  You never got}{\b\f8  }{\f8 her}{\b\f8  }{\f8 back?
\par SM:\tab No, could not, couldn't find her.  Allegedly we talked to people who, the orphanage didn't exist after the war, and allegedly she died.
\par GS:\tab What year...
\par SM:\tab But we're not sure.
\par GS:\tab What year was it when you arrived in the United States?
\par SM:\tab I arrived in '56.
\par GS:\tab I'm curious to know a little more about your family, if I may ask you.  There obviously was a Zionist feeling within your family.  Was it a religious Jewish family, or Socialist?  What was the tradition?
\par SM:\tab My mother was very religious.  My father was, had certain Socialist ideas, but more Zionist.
\par GS:\tab You mentioned that there was little antisemitism that you experienced when you were with the partisans.  Earlier in your life in Poland, had you experienced antisemitism?
\par SM:\tab Oh yes [unclear].
\par GS:\tab Directly}{\b\f8 .}{\f8 
\par SM:\tab There is, as a child I was "God-killer" whenever there was a religious holiday\emdash  you had to try to avoid the Polish children.  There was, Poland was highly antisemitic.
\par GS:\tab What would happen if you met these children on a holiday?  They would taunt you?
\par SM:\tab Oh we used to fight.
\par GS:\tab Beating?
\par SM:\tab Oh yes.  Since they were always in majority, was, we had finally to escape, to run.
\par GS:\tab You never thought about wanting to return to Poland?
\par SM:\tab No.
\par GS:\tab You held Soviet citizenship, however.  Had you ever considered staying in the Soviet Union?
\par SM:\tab No, after I have seen the paradise of the working class, I decided to go to hell.
\par GS:\tab [laughs]
\par SM:\tab [laughs]
\par GS:\tab The experience had been good in that it saved your family?  But it wasn't a...
\par SM:\tab 
Yes, to a certain degree I, one has to say that when, in 1939, when the Jews needed help, the only country which helped was Russia.  America did not let in any Jews.  Was a ship of Jews from Germany who were in Miami that were in New York, and I was i
n Germany when the Jewish community gave some kind of a prize to the captain of the ship who tried, and had to bring the people back to Germany.  But the Russians opened the borders, "Come in!"
\par GS:\tab Was it that they needed labor at that time, to develop?
\par SM:\tab It could be.  It was also that Stalin was not, at that time, was not antisemitic yet.  It was later that he changed.  The plot of the doctors and so on.  In 1945 I was in Moscow and saw the Jewish theater in Moscow.  It was the...
\par GS:\tab Yiddish theater?
\par SM:\tab The best Yiddish theater I have ever seen!  And after that, a short time after that they closed it.  And to say, the argument was they closed it that there was because there were not enough interest.  You could
n't get tickets to the, you had to buy tickets in two, three, four, five months in advance!
\par GS:\tab This was in '45.
\par SM:\tab 
Was in '45.  And it was in Yiddish, and very often you saw, I remember once sitting, near me was sitting a young lady, and each time when people were laughing used to say to her mother, "Mommy what did they say?"  She didn't understand the Yiddi-, the
 language, but still she came to, to...
\par GS:\tab The theater was popular.
\par SM:\tab To see.  And to say after that, that they closed it because there was not enough interest, this happened later.  But at that time when I was, in forty-, until '45 I did not see antisemitism.  [tape off then on]
\par GS:\tab How much did you know of what was happening, when you were in the area of the Urals, about the persecution and killing of Jews in the west?
\par SM:\tab We didn't know anything.
\par GS:\tab Nothing.
\par SM:\tab Nothing.  As a matter of fact, when I came to Minsk, I remember talking to a neighbor of my sister's, and he said, \ldblquote What, at this time does a Jew come from Ural mountains to Minsk?\rdblquote  
 And I said, "Why?  What?"  He said, "The Germans are close by."  This was...
\par GS:\tab About...
\par SM:\tab They heard already...
\par GS:\tab '41 or '42...
\par SM:\tab That something, yeah, they heard that something funny is going on, while in the Ural mountains you know nothing, you heard nothing.  And you couldn't read it from the papers, because the paper didn't say anything.
\par GS:\tab This is what we have heard about most of the Soviet, people in the Soviet Union were uninformed completely about what was happening in the world outside.  Except in the eastern...
\par SM:\tab No, we did read...
\par GS:\tab I mean in the western...
\par SM:\tab But was...
\par GS:\tab Portions.
\par SM:\tab Yeah, we did read what, that France is being occupied, and so on and forth.  But what is happening to the Jews, nothing.
\par GS:\tab There was no word.
\par SM:\tab No word.
\par GS:\tab When did you first learn of what happened in the camps?  After the war?
\par SM:\tab Oh, about 
the various camps, this I heard after the war, in, in, in Minsk, or at all in White Russia there was immediately, the solution was on hand.  In other way we knew that the people are being killed.  We knew that the people, the Jews are being killed.
\par GS:\tab You had seen this when you were in the ghetto I guess.
\par SM:\tab Yes.
\par GS:\tab Yes.
\par SM:\tab In other words, they didn't kill, they killed in the ghetto too, but...
\par GS:\tab They were taken away, and...
\par SM:\tab They were taking out, and not far away we heard even when there will be k
illings, because we knew that they are digging graves.  Still there was no, no, nothing to do.  Was a question, where to run, what to do?  Later, we wondered, why did we sit so long when we saw, hey, that we could have simply gone into the forest.
\par GS:\tab Well you had to learn that that was a possibility.
\par SM:\tab Yes.
\par GS:\tab Was there any, message brought from other places?  Did you hear of what was happening in any other towns?
\par SM:\tab Yes.  This we did, because occasionally some were coming to Minsk from a neighboring t
own where all Jews were killed, and the remaining were escaping, came to Minsk.  So we knew that, this is why also we did what we were done, because we have seen sooner or later the whole ghetto will be destroyed.  And we have to get away.  Otherwise we'l
l be, initially we still hoped, hey, maybe the Russian army will push back and so on.  But after, after a year, year-and-a-half, we saw that there is no hope...
\par GS:\tab Wasn't happening.
\par SM:\tab Was no hope in it.  And we decided to try it in a different way.
\par GS:\tab You had no news of what was happening in a place like Kiev, Kiev, the slaughter at Babi Yar, and,...
\par SM:\tab 
No, Babi Yar I heard of after the war.  I knew that they, I can, I could imagine what happened, because we know what the, how the Ukrainians behaved in our place.  But was with Babi Yar was also in Minsk.  There were more people killed in Minsk than i
n Babi Yar.  In Minsk were killed 120,000 Jews!
\par GS:\tab So you didn't need to have any other...
\par SM:\tab No, no.
\par GS:\tab Examples to know that the partisans was the only way to choose, to exist.
\par SM:\tab Right.
\par GS:\tab Is there anything else that you feel you would want to mention that I haven't asked you about?  Just let me touch on one other thing.  There was never any effort to enlist you or other partisans in the Soviet army, was there?
\par SM:\tab No, the, after the war.  When the, when I, when the Russian army has taken, came to the place which was near Bialystok, was already '44, and then the war was prac\-tically, practically won already.  [noise in background; tape off then on]
\par GS:\tab Do you have any feeling you would be willing to share as to how, why, you survived, some terribly dangerous, awful experiences?  Do you feel that, did your religious faith answer in any way, or do you have any other feelings about your survival?

\par SM:\tab 
Yes, simply a strong will to live.  We tried to do whatever possible, whatever we could, to survive.  From standing guard in ghetto to building all kinds of places to hide.  Not to be passive and say, "Somebody else will help us."  No, we have to do s
omething else.  There is a certain amount of luck also involved.  But definitely you cannot be passive.  You have to be active, and to do something in order to survive.  And those who did not do, who tried only to rely on faith, did not survive.
\par GS:\tab Your youth and your general good health put you in a good position to act upon these feelings.
\par SM:\tab Definitely this helped.  Definitely helped.
\par GS:\tab And yet there were other young, healthy people who did not act.  Was it out of fear, do you think, that they were unable to participate in the way you did?
\par SM:\tab Very often people did not act because, family ties.  Those who were with mothers, fathers, they could not leave them and}{\b\f8  }{\f8 
run.  It helped, the fact that my mother was away helped me survive.  I doubt if I, if my mother were in with me in ghetto, that I would have had the courage, the strength to leave her and go.  And after all to go out into the forest, and you know that mi
nus forty degrees to be in the, to make, to have to sleep on the snow and so on, is not, is not easy.
\par GS:\tab It seems almost unbelievable that you could survive those conditions.
\par SM:\tab 
And after years, and after a certain time, we always thought, why did we wait so long, when you know it.  Most people did not know that there is a way.  There was not help from the neighbors, who could have helped much more than they did.  For us part
icular, it was, particularly this was difficult, because we were in a strange environment.  We didn't know the people in Minsk.  We did not know, especially, the peasants around it.  We did not know that it's simply possible to go there.
\par GS:\tab What was your first contact with the partisans?
\par SM:\tab 
It helped through my brother-in-law, who was a fighter all his life.  And he started to go out into the villages to exchange clothes for food, bring food into the ghetto.  After that I joined him.  This was our first step to see, "Hey.  We can go out.
  We can get over, away."  Then was a question to try to find some kind of contacts.  It happened also certain luck that a person who was a prominent 
Jewish Communist leader who was in the building where we lived.  We discussed certain times, several times, he slept in our room.  And then when he was in hiding because the Germans were looking for him, he came to us for help.  And we offered immediately
, without any question, sure we'll hide you.  Through him we started to get certain contacts.  So, it was from one part our action, and from other part the willingness of, to look, not to, not to give up hope.  To look for ways out.  This what happened.

\par GS:\tab You have to seek it in order to find it.
\par SM:\tab Yes.
\par GS:\tab Some partisan groups did not accept the Jews.  Some actually turned on them.  But this group in the forest near Minsk had Jewish people working with them and accepted you.
\par SM:\tab 
There were many groups which accepted.  Obviously, if they wanted, they could have saved many more Jews.  If there were some kind of a action to try to save Jews, Jews could have been saved, because many simply did not know where to go, what to do.  N
ot many, }{\i\f8 most}{\f8  of the
 people.  Had the Russian partisans be more interested in saving Jews, they could have saved much more, many more.  They did not actually do anything to save, but they did not refuse, most of them did not refuse when somebody came to them.
\par GS:\tab Whereas the Polish partisans, by contrast, did turn away.
\par SM:\tab Oh, these Polish partisans we were always fighting.  I participated in one case in disarming Polish partisans, because they were interested more in fighting us than in fight\-ing Germans.  I never heard abou

\par GS:\tab Well, I want to thank you very much.  And I realize it's }{\i\f8 Dr.}{\f8 
 Makower, as you're addressed.  I know it hasn't been easy to draw on these old memories, but what you've told I think will be very valuable to people who come to study seriously what the war years did to the Jewish people.  And it will be passed on from
