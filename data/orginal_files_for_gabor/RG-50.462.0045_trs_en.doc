Oh yes, in fact my best friend was a non-Jew at that time as a school boy. We went together to school every morning, we lived in the same apartment building, and we would go together to school, the same walk to the school and back.
\par }\pard \sl360\slmult1\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440 {\f108 \tab JF:\tab What kind of school was this?

\i\f108 Realgymnasium}{\f108  which would be the same type of }{\i\f108 Gymnasium}{\f108  but, for example in the proper }{\i\f108 Gymnasium}{\f108  you would have Latin and Greek languages and of course the other languages, French or English. In the }{
\i\f108 Real-gymnasium}{\f108 , to say it in German, at  the moment, we had Latin and French and English but we didn\rquote t have Greek, that was the difference.
\par \tab JF:\tab What did that difference mean in terms of the education at the time?
\par \tab WN:\tab You just had another language, an old language like Greek, for example and Latin and we left the Greek out, we just had the Latin and the English and the French.
\par \tab JF:\tab It was more current?
\par \tab WN:\tab Yeah, I would say that.
\par \tab JF:\tab So you were in German public schools then essentially with the high schools and your lower schooling was also?
\par \tab WN:\tab \tab No, at the time the school had what you call public school now, we had that in one building in the same school. We had three years of let\rquote 
s say of public school for children growing up and then we had the other classes which were the languages and all that.  It\rquote s a little hard to compare from there to here.
\par \tab JF:\tab But you were in the educational system that most of the other German children were in. It was not a separate system, you were not in separate Jewish schools?
\par \tab WN:\tab No, our religious, our training of learning were actually in the same building, in the same class, everything the same, but we had a rabbi who came to the school and taught us.

t see out of one eye, so he was never in the army. Furthermore, coming from Austria at that time, he was not a German citizen first. He then became a German citizen, he was naturalized.

\par \tab JF:\tab This would have been at Gestapo headquarters  that you would have had to apply for it?
\par \tab WN:\tab Yeah, and when you do that, ask for a receipt of}{\b\i\f108  }{\f108 your application so you can\rquote t get in trouble when you ar

 knew before, and I went into the dining room after I had taken my room and took my clothes and refreshed myself and so on, and I came into the dining room and they had greeted me already as an old friend, and I was ordering the dinner and 
reading the menu and giving my order, and I looked up and behind a wardrobe stand where you put your clothes was that sign.

\par }\pard \sl360\slmult1\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440 {\f108 \tab WN:\tab Right. So I said, "Call the owner," and it was a lady. She came out and she said, \ldblquote What\rquote s the matter?\rdblquote  I said, }{\f4 \ldblquote C}{\f108 
ancel my order and cancel my room, I am leaving. She said, \ldblquote What\rquote s the matter?  Why?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote You see this.\rdblquote  So she took a coat and she hung it over the sign and she said, \ldblquote Do you see that sign?
\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote No.\rdblquote   \ldblquote What do you want?\rdblquote  This is the way they handled it. So I stayed there,}{\f108\sub  }{\f108 naturally, and there was always a place where you could stay, of course.
\par \tab JF:\tab These were primarily people that you had known before?
\par \tab WN:\tab Most of them, because I was staying overnight in those hotels. Then I met, this is an interesting part, then I met a young man who I knew as a competitor, a salesman, a competitor from another company and he said, \ldblquote 
Willi, how are you?\rdblquote  We had actually met in a customer\rquote s place. I was waiting outside because if someone goes in, we used to wait outside for the competitor to come out and then we would go in. So he said, \ldblquote Willi, when
 did you come back?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Just a few weeks ago.}{\f4 \rdblquote }{\f108  He said, \ldblquote Let\rquote s talk about it, I\rquote m finished, I\rquote ll wait for you.  When you finish we will go and have a coffee.\rdblquote 
 And he was, do you know the name Horst Wessel? Horst Wessel was the man who actually composed the song and he was a very good friend of that man. But we were very good together, too, and he said, he waited. When we were finished, he said, \ldblquote Let
\rquote s go together and have a coffee,\rdblquote  so we went and he said, \ldblquote Where are you going now?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Well I\rquote m going this week all the way down to southern Germany.\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote 
I have a car.\rdblquote  (I didn\rquote t have a car at that time.) \ldblquote How about we go together?\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Now wait a minute! You are working for a competitor. They will know very soon that you and I are going 
together, and I am in your car, do you know what that means? You are taking a Jew in your car?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote Let me worry about that. We go together.\rdblquote 
\par \tab JF:\tab On the paper, this temporary application that you were carrying with you at this point before your passport, before the stateless passport came through, was there a J?

\par }\pard \sl360\slmult1\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440 {\f108 \tab WN:\tab No. Nothing. So, when we came back to Berlin, he said, \ldblquote Well, we meet again on Monday.\rdblquote  This was over the weekend. \ldblquote 
We meet on Monday again and we go together again!\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote Look, you better check this, because you are going to get into trouble}{\b\i\f108  }{\f108 with your company and I don\rquote t want this.\rdblquote

 And, of course, then we split up and I took the train again, that was all. 
\par \tab JF:\tab Did you continue to have contact with him?
\par }\pard \fi7\sl360\slmult1\nowidctlpar\tx720\tx1440 {\f108 \tab WN:\tab 
Yeah, only with cards and so on. There was another incident which was interesting. When I was travelling I also set up distributors in certain areas, so I had an ad in the paper, and I interviewed them at night in a hotel to see if I can set up a loc
al distributor for our produ
cts, and this man came to the hotel, he had applied for the distributorship, and he was a local salesman there. He had several companies that he already represented. So, we sat together and I liked him, and he also came from Berlin, and I hired him for th
at particular area as a distributor, and one day he came and said, \ldblquote You know, this is interesting.\rdblquote 
 I took him together with me to train him and to introduce him to the local customers, so that they know that he will represent our company instead of me. So one evening we were in our hotel after we worked together and made our reports and he said, 
\ldblquote You know, a funny thing happened.\rdblquote  There was one drugstore that had about eight branches in that city, in other words like a chain, and he said, \ldblquote You know this guy what he said to me today?\rdblquote   I said, \ldblquote No.
\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote You know the man with whom you are working together, he\rquote s a Jew.\rdblquote  And he, the salesman laughed, would you believe that? Now I was fast thinking, I figured, if I say something now, I pull the rug from und
er his feet, so I didn\rquote t say}{\b\i\f108  }{\f108 anything, I didn\rquote t say yes or no or nothing. I just didn\rquote 
t react to it and let it go, and I had made up my mind when I come back to Berlin and I meet him, then I will tell him. And we worked together, we continued working; everything was fine, and I left 
for Berlin and about two or three weeks later he called me and he said, \ldblquote Willi, how are you?  I am back here temporarily,}{\i\f108  }{\f108 how about having some coffee?\rdblquote  and I said, \ldblquote Fine.\rdblquote 
 I had made up my mind, when he walks in, and I am sitting at the table before and I am going to tell him I am a Jew, and if he don\rquote t like it, just don\rquote t sit at my table. And he came in, and I was already waiting and I said, \ldblquote 
Before you sit down, I want you to know\rdblquote }{\b\f108  }{\f108 and he said, \ldblquote I know that.\rdblquote  I said, \ldblquote What do you mean you know that?\rdblquote  He said, \ldblquote I\rquote ve known for quite a while.\rdblquote  I said, 
\ldblquote How come?\rdblquote  There was a Jewish girl that I knew when we were young, we grew up together in the same neighborhood in Berlin and I found her by accident in a cafe house which we were s
itting, this salesman and I, and she was a prostitute, a Jewish prostitute, and, of course, I didn\rquote t know that. He said to me, \ldblquote You know that girl?\rdblquote   And I said, \ldblquote Yeah. I know her from where we grew up together.
\rdblquote   He said, \ldblquote Oh.\rdblquote  So I didn\rquote t say anything.  She told him that I am a Jew and I said, \ldblquote You still went with me?\rdblquote  And he said, \ldblquote Sure.\rdblquote
