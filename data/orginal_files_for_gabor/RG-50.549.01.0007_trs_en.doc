\par Question: Erwin Baum interview in Riverdale, New York, and December fifth.  Well, first perhaps -- let's go back just a little bit to, if you could talk a little bit about the circumstances leading up to the time of, of t
he liberation. What was, what was happening to you at that time in, you know, '44, '45?
\par Answer:  While in camp, or prior to the camp?
\par Q: In the camp.  Why don't we start, start just talking about when, your arrival in the camp and a little bit, if you tell me, just give me a little bit of a sense what that experience was like on a day-to-day basis.
\par A: Yeah.  Well, approximately in the Fall of 1942, I was transported from ghetto to Auschwitz concentration camp -- I arrived with my mother, my sisters and my t
wo brothers -- where, at the time of arrival, men and women were separate immediately and when it came to select, to separate men, to put them in the right places, me and my two brothers were approached by the, by the German officer.  He pointed my brothe
r
s to one side and me to another side.  Within twenty or thirty minutes, I found myself standing with all the men and young children.  On the other hand, on the other side, I saw where my brothers were, were about 45 young men.  Something told me that I am
 
in the wrong spot, I didn't like where I am, I didn't know why.  When the soldier passed me by, I just ran across to where my brothers were.  Later on, about 45, 50 boys were ordered to kind of slow running, jogging, went into Auschwitz.  On the spot wher
e
 I was, they went all to crematorium, they were gassed.  So did my mother, my sisters.  At that time, there were no women needed for labor, so all the women were gassed from that particular transport.  When I arrived in Auschwitz, I was the youngest of th
e camper -- of about 18,000 inmates,}{\cs33\super\insrsid2580002 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s32\ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \f1\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\cs33\super\insrsid2580002 \chftn }{

 in the orphanage, where I spent some years.  Many times, while German occupation on the ghetto, I had the chance to go o
ut of the ghetto, over a wall or by a certain tube or by the way of a sewer, to go to the Polish side, where I did not look very much Jewish and I spoke very clear Polish, and the doctor used to give me a few zlotys so I could buy some supplies.  I me\'85

e
re also during the night I used to go over the gate to the Polish side and buy loaves of bread, throw over the gate, throw over the wall to my mother; she used to sell it.  What I want to bring out, that one particular night when it -- they decided to eva

, I was out of that ghetto, particularly that night. So, that happened to be what, one of the miracles that happened in my life, that I was not there at that night.  When I arrived i
n there in the morning, the whole orphanage was gone, although I tried to join them and I was chased away by police that said, "You're not Jewish, get lost."  There was another, another instinct while in concentration camp.  If one was quite awhile in con
c
entration camp, you got known and if the -- a good job, a good kind of opportunity came along, naturally the older inmates got priority.  So I had a good job.  I was working in a, in a place sorting clothes and while you sort clothes from the people that 
a
rrive from, from, from, from Poland to Holland, to -- or France, you always found an extra bite, something to eat.  So I was pretty content.  One day this German woman, a Nazi, uniform, I'll never forget her name, her name was Berta, she was wearing these
 
leather boots and a whip, just flipping around her whip against her boots and was pointing with the, with the whip to certain men and young boys, and only with, with, with good skin on them, that the ribs were not exposed, the bones were not exposed, I ha

 to many, many camps.  From camp to camp, from camp to camp, because, as I said, the Germans were building little air strips, so always a few hundred men were in a certain, out of a village, like they had a, they had a \-\-
shack made out of metal and they kept us there.  But on the last days of war, like 
maybe it's known already to you that they put all the inmates on a dead march, and I was among also them, a dead march. We were marching and marching and marching and marching, thousands of, of people, of men, thousands of them, and everyday there were le
s
s and less and less and less.  They left a certain time, I don't remember, a few weeks, after marching once, they told us to sit down and have our break.  It was no coffee break, by all means, they gave us a few cold potatoes to eat and then they said, "O
k
ay, let's go."  Well, like the message passed from one to another, nobody would get up anymore.  Like it was senseless, no use.  So they got very angry and they ordered us to go up the hill and go against the trees and hands up.  They said that they wante
d to, to execute and also they gave the order, the, the high rank officer gave the order the soldiers, like \'93aim at the neck.\'94
 And we heard that the guns -- you know, whatever they had to do -- we heard that noise and we keep our hands up and we wait and wa
it and wait and wait and nothing happens, and then we hear one soldier looking through his binoculars said, "Mine God, four kilometers from here are the Americans."  We heard that, and we stay and naturally you stay so long with your hands up, you get a l
i
ttle tired, so you kind of, we kind of look back a little bit and we saw no more Germans. So we drop our hands, we turn around, no Germans. So naturally we run down the hill, and believe it or not the tanks and trucks were rolling and we ran and, "Please,
 
please, take us, take us, take us."  Unfortunately, they had other orders than to take us and they passed by, they left us there, and the Germans came back and took us again.  Took us again, put us in that camp and then not long we were liberated.  We wer
e
 liberated in, as I told you, in Allach when the allies came in, naturally they came in, they make pictures and everybody was running and asking, making motions with their hands for food, because we didn't know how to speak English.  And they said, "Yeah,
 
yeah, yeah," but nothing happened, there was nothing there, and by that time the Germans left us a few days before. They were afraid and we were kind of sorry because like this, everyday we got a little bit whatever -- we got.  But like us, for three, fou
r
 days, we got nothing, and the allies came and still there's nothing.  But I, as I was used to sneak around and hassle to find always an extra bite, I went up on a -- it's bigger than a Jeep, kind of a little -- little truck, and I was looking, looking an
d
 I found and I ate a full box of what I thought it was chocolate and I ate a box of Ex-lax.  I didn't know, I was happy, I found chocolate, I ate it and you could imagine what happened to me.  I, I got very, very, very in bad shape, pain, and I walked out
 
of that, of that camp and there was this, on the road there was the field kitchen that the soldiers were fed, and I went and I was crying, "Pain, pain, pain," and there was one American soldier of Russian descent and he spoke a little kind of broken Polis
h, and I told him that I'm so sick.  So he put me in his car, in, in his Jeep, and drove me to town called M\'fc
hldorf, put me in a hospital.  They put me in a hospital.  Oh, that was beautiful.  They fed me a Farina with milk and sugar for about two weeks, an
d I, I just walked out of the hospital and went on my own.  I went on my own and went into a little, a little village called, it was M\'fc
hldorf, I forgot the name, and I met with two other friends from concentration camp and there were, and, and on a, on a f
arm with two German older sisters and they just, they thought that they have to take in, anybody that comes in they have to take in and take care of them.

 did we do those business, that kind of business, preparation, storage, buy food, put away, all in, in our mind was only not to be hungry, anymore.  That's why we didn't want to wait, many of us, we didn't want to wait to get a handout, to wait from the U
N
RRA to give us something.  I mean the first money came to my pocket and the first bakery I saw, I must have bought about thirty loaves of bread, and put it away.  That was, you know, only in our mind, nothing else, nothing else mattered till later on, sta
r
t, you know, we start to relive the whole bitter experience, try to look if anybody was left of the family, or whatever.  And we came to Munich and got involved in business, doing business with, with the Germans, or with the Americans, kind of start, star
t
, start a new life again.  Till one day, I met somebody and I saw a number.  By the number, we could identify which transport or which camp that person was, and I saw this number and I knew that he was in one of the camps where I was, which is Buna, and m
y
 brother was there.  So I ask him, "You must have been in Buna."  He says, "Sure, I sure was."  "Did you happen to know Icek Baum?"  He says, "Sure, I know him.  Here's his address.  He survived.  He's in Czechoslovakia."  Now, you can imagine how I felt.
  Immediately, I ran to a, to a translator that wrote a letter to the government of Czechoslovakia and I'm looking, looking for this person.  Unfortunately, the answer came that \'93No one like this is known by the name.\'94
  During that time, my brother Icek -- 
and there's my older brother who wind up in Belgium, he was liberated somewhere and they went to Belgium -- thank God they found each other, and they were writing letters to each other and crying over my death.  In the meantime, I was a hustler.  I was su
c
cessful in Munich.  I was the first boy who could have a car, you know, I put a pillow under my seat so girls could see me and I was doing pretty well, and they were crying over me.  But that never gave me any rest, that he told me my brother, and, and, a
n
d then I gave up hope.  I said, "Well, must have been a mistake or something."  Well, one day my brother Icek from Czechoslovakia decided to join up with his brother in Belgium.  So he had to leave Czechoslovakia, come to Germany and somehow go to Belgium
.  On the train going to, going to Munich, he met up with a girl and says, "Why don't you accompany us to our camp?"  And so he spent sometime with her.  She says \'93Okay.\'94
  On the train station, he meets again the same person who told me that my brother was 
alive.  He says, "Did you find your brother?"  "Oh, come on, I have no brother."  He says, "Yes, you have a brother.  He's got a golden tooth, wavy hair."  Now, again, my oldest brother that did not survive had the golden tooth and wavy, wavy hair.  But t
h
at didn't matter.  But he brought them next day to me, you know, to Munich and I joined up with Icek and I says, "Edyl didn't survive."  He says, "What do you mean, he didn't survive?  He's in Belgium."  So then, somehow, we got together, all three.  I wa
s
 very happy.  Me, me and my brother Icek went to Belgium to be with my, with my, with my other brother, and we were in a home not, not doing much.  But that didn't give me any rest.  I used to go over the border, forth and back, back and forth to, to Germ
a
ny, do a little business, and then one day I was caught on the border, you know, and Belgium gave me a deportation.  I had to leave Belgium.  So, somebody took me over to Luxembourg.  I went to Luxembourg and while I was in Belgium, somebody from my homet
o
wn, from Warsaw, approached me.  He says, "Hey, you're 19 years old, you're just walking the streets, not doing nothing.  Why don't you come to my place down, I, I have a fur shop.  I put you down by the machine. If you learn the trade in two weeks, you h
a
ve a job and you can make something."  I says fine.  So, I learned the trade and it was very useful, because when I went to Luxembourg they gave me a job by a furrier and I was working there, and then the war broke out in Israel and my brother from Belgiu
m decided to go as a volunteer.  So I figured, my brother's going, what I'm going do all alone here?  I went to Israel also, as a volunteer and became a Navy man.

in Munich, say, and right after the war -- 19, 20 early 20s.  What was life like there for you at that time?  I mean, you know, were you, were you -- you say you, you were interested in meeting women or were you hang\'85
hanging out with friends or did you -- who were you, who were you -- what kind of social at\'85atmosphere was there at that time?
\par A: Well, we had an apartment.  Sure, I was interested, I was interested in girls and we had a maid in the house.  You know, we used to socialize. We used to go out, the
re were concerts and, as I told you, I had a car and I couldn't register the car because there was that gasoline business.  So I went to the, to the office of the Israel -- it was the Palestine, you know, Palestine consul -- and they had doctors to be dri
ven around from camp to camp to, to check out the children, were they in good condition to eventually immigrate to Israel.  I mean I was busy that I had my little world around me.
\par Q: Who were the other members of that world and...
\par A: Well, only, only us sur
vivors.  Only us survivors.  We only mingled with the survivors, and then, naturally, started a business, buying American dollars, buying diamonds, buying watches, exchanging, doing this and that.  Purpose, there was no purpose.  We didn\rquote 
t know -- just for the moment, to have a comfortable life.  \lquote Til, \lquote til I went to Belgium and then to Luxembourg and then to Israel, where I joined the Israeli Navy, also as a volunteer.
\par Q: Was it, was it worth -- was it chaot\'85 were, I mean you told me the story about you an
d your, your finding your brothers. I mean there must have been -- everybody, all of your friends -- must have had those stories of trying to find people and it seems like it must have been chaotic.
\par A: Oh, it was very, very chaotic.  Very, very, very emoti
onal.   I mean, it was, it was unbelievable.  It took about a year and a half to find them, you know.  And while my brother was in Belgium, I got some connection with somebody who had connection with the Belgian consulate in Munich, and that man, that con
s
ulate gave to that man a list of names of people that did not survive.  So we used that opportunity, because people didn't want to stay in Germany, Munich.  They wanted to go.  United States didn't open up the doors, yet.  Canada, nothing happened.  To Is
r
ael, nobody could go. So if there's opportunity to go somewhere, they wanted to go.  So for 200 dollars,  I was able to get an ID, piece of paper with a picture ID on the name of the person who perished in Belgium, and he could go home.  So that person ar
rived in Belgium and Belgium the HIAS changed and gave him some, some papers.  So we, we had the world and then, as when my turn came, I went to Belgium.
\par Q: What was it like being in, in Germany af\'85after the war?  I mean, did you, were you, were you angry at the Germans?
\par A: Oh, we were, we were, we were very an\'85 very, very angry.  But, what, what can I tell you?  We were very, very rough, very arrogant in, in the beginning.  Like we went on a train and they ask for a, for a train ticket.  We used to say, \'93Hi
tler paid already.\'94  We never stood in line -- like, like taking advantage of the situation.  But after awhile, we calmed down.  We calmed down, because we say, \'93
Hey, what's the use, after all, you cannot blame the whole, the whole nation for it.  Here, now, the Nazis, I thought were arrested and taken care of, and the children of them are regretting, and then they're feeling with us, they're nice to us.\'94
  So you know, they try to brainwash us, and as a young person, from bad to good, you got kind of a little bit brainwashed and, and, and calmed down, you know.
\par Q: What do you mean brainwashed?
\par A: That they say, \'93It's not my fault, I didn't know, my daddy, you know, it was very bad, he was forced into it.  He didn't mean to do it.  If he wouldn't join the Nazi party, he would go also to concentration camp.\'94
  And, and I saw these things happen because there were cer
tain times where, where SS soldiers were brought to concentration camp for not fulfilling the orders that they received.  I didn't know exactly what the orders were.  Like one very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the un
i
form, put on concentration camp uniform, shaved the head, and we had to speak to him.  He says, "Well, I was a very high rank officer and I came home on vacation and my wife and the children were deported to a camp."  He says, "Why?"  Because apparently, 
h
is wife's grandfather descended from a gypsy.  So that made her also a gypsy, they put in concentration camp.  So he came back, he says,  "Who am I fighting for?"  You know, so he came to concentration camp.  So, this way the Germans of the war made us be
lieve somehow that they were not completely to blame, that they were, were brainwashed, that, that circumstances brought them to that.
\par Q: And yet, it seemed reasonable at the time?
\par A: I mean, I was reasonable, because after all, I, I didn't read any books.  I wasn't that my --that much educa\'85
educated.  After the war, I didn't feel like going back to school and, you know, I wanted to roam around, to drive my car, to show off, go to dancing, be with girls, and my dream was to have a beautiful blue suit with wh
ite stripes.  It was impossible to get it, but somehow I got it.  So like after the war, whatever I wanted, it came to me, it fell into my lap, very easy.  So I stopped thinking ab\'85
about the past.  I mean, it happened, it's unrepairable and when I found my
 two brothers, I was very, very, very, very happy and we kind of started a new life again.  And as I said, the war broke out in Israel and my brother went.  I says, "What am I sitting here in Luxembourg? There's no future here. I go to Israel."  And I wen
t to Israel and then I went to the, to the Israeli Navy as a volunteer.

What am I sitting here, sitting in Luxembourg?  I'm with people that I, that I don't know, all alone, and I have a brother that came up from concentration camp.  I want to be with him.\'94

, because I left once.  They wouldn't help me, so I was...by the way, I came into Belgium not legal, just 
with a transit for three months and I used to have to be -- have to -- had to hide out because the police was always chasing me. "You have to leave, you have to leave, you cannot be here, cannot be here."  But to Israel I didn't want to go back, to Poland
 I didn't want to go, so I made an application to go to United States or to Canada, whatever comes first.
\par Q: Let me ask you about, I was wondering about how you met your wife in the army?
\par A: Well, I met my wife through a, through a friend.  We used to walk 
when we had our, our day off or a few hours off, we used to walk on a main street and there was a photograph shop and my wife's picture was there.  So my friend went in there.  He said, "Who is that girl?"  So, he introduced her, so they went out, and if 
o
ne goes out, I was going with my friend also, you know.  So she kind of liked me better because my, my, my friend was a kind of little, little funny making, making jokes, throwing over garbage cans and all that, and I was more on the quiet side, so she li
ked me and she intro\'85introduced him to her girlfriend and we got married and, after, they got married.

\par A: No, I didn't want to go back to Poland, no.  Poland, there's nothing there.  No, I didn't want to go back to Poland.

\par A: In Poland?
\par Q: Yeah.
\par A: There was nothing the
re.  All the family, everything was gone.  The house, we, we heard a rumor it burned down.  There was nothing there, and, and I suffered prior the war in Poland very much.  I -- as I said, I only have four years of education.  I had to be twice in grade f
o
ur -- in fourth grade because of the anti-Semitism.  If there was a, a religious -- hour of religion, Jewish boys or girls had to go out of the classroom.  When it was over, they came and start to beat me up because I killed Jesus.  So I had a very sour t
aste about Poland, didn't want to go back to Poland.  And in Belgium, I couldn't stay, so, and then Canada opened up, it was mass immigration, so I went to Canada.
\par Q: I'm curious as to -- how, how did the experience of, of, the experiences you had influ\'85influence the way that you and your wife decided to plan your life?  I mean, did you -- do you think you kind of fell in love in the way that you\'85
young people do here, or were you kind of hardened by the experiences you'd had and so didn't really have that -- kind of fall in love that way, or what was the...?
\par A: Well, I did fall in love with her because she was 19, I was about 21, two young people started to grow up together, used to each other, and I was there for her, she was there for me, in the beginning. 
 Then we came to Canada, started a new life, could -- tried to have a child, couldn't have a child, you know, tried and tried and tried.  Business-wise, I became quite successful and finally in 1960 we adopted our daughter, which brought the greatest happ
iness in my life.
\par Q: What were you do... what was your career -- what career did you have?
\par A: Well, I started out as my trade as a furrier. But because I always was a hustler, I never felt like working for somebody else.  So I started to work for myself, as
 a furrier.  Then I changed, I opened up a driving school with somebody and I did driving school for ten years.  Then\emdash 
\par Q: Did you taught or did you have a -- were you...?
\par A: No, no, I taught how to drive. Yeah, I taught how to drive and then I drove taxis and then a building boom started.  People were starting, getting money from cl\emdash 
 from Germany for restitution, you know, reparation money, and they want to buy houses and I saw on every corner they, they're building houses.  So, I went into construction business also.
\par Q: What, what kind of business was it, just...
\par A: Building, building, building houses.
\par Q: Contracting or...?
\par A: No, just building from, from, from ground.  Yeah, build -- built houses and sold them and made some nice money, and then I was appro
ached by some distant relative of my wife, I should come to United States, that the, the opportunity would be better and there are many people that would invest because they saw my experience because if I started a, a project, I was the first one to finis
h
 it, the first one to sell them.  So they kind of like it.  So I came to United States and it didn't turn out to be the way they said it's going to be.  So I naturally came here and I spent two years in, in United States, not legal, because I couldn't com
e, they wouldn't let me.
\par Q: How did it turn out not the way you thought it was, not the way they said it was going to be?
\par A: Well, instead of my benefiting from them, they wanted to benefit from me.  For instance, I had to grab a bus, leave my wife and kid 
at home and come because a broker called and there's a piece of land available, I have to go and see it, so I left everything and I came to see it.  I drove around a whole week and I did what I had to do and Sunday -- everybody -- we had -- were supposed 
to be full partners and then Sunday I had to go up and show them.  \'93See, if we built here, we make you the garden apartments or two units,\'94
 this and that, and everybody gave their opinion, not knowing what they're talking about.  And that was going on for m
onths and I -- even came a time when -- where in New Jersey, I actually made deposits to purchase some land for garden apartments and again, you know, back and forth, back and forth.  So one day I called a meeting.  I says, "We are here, four partners.  W
e
 are ready to invest about 100,000 dollars.  But in the meantime, everyone of you is working and making a living and you're calling me.  I come here, I spend time, I leave a wife and a child, I have nothing.  I would like that everybody should give me 25 
dollars and I give myself 25 dollars, so I can send 100 dollars home so they can live.\'94
  "Oh well, you start to build, we sell, you make money."  So I saw, so I just canceled out the whole thing, took back the deposits. But somehow I had to come to this cou
ntry, so the only way was to clear the Labor Department.  So I bought with somebody a little luncheonette.  I thought it would be for a short time, so that I clear the department.  So I came here, took me two years, until finally I got my green card, and 
I got stuck in that luncheonette for six years.
\par Q: What do you mean?  You bought -- you owned it?
\par A: I owned the luncheonette, yes.
\par Q: Where was it?
\par A: On one, on Hudson Street, near the printing, near the Holland Tunnel, the exit of the Holland Tunnel.  So
 I was stuck there for six years.  It was the worst six years of my life, I must say, as a free man.  I had to get up three o'clock in the morning and work and work and work and work, and finally I said if I'm not going to sell it, I'm going to burn it.  
I
 was so fed up.  So finally in 1972, I was lucky to sell it and then my brother-in-law was in Russia and they married off their daughter and I always wanted to go, and like before I always, my dream was to go on a cruise.  So I remember I was signing the 
p
apers Friday to sell the store.  Saturday morning, I still had to go to the accountant to iron out some things and then a telephone call came in and they say there are two spots for 499 dollars on a cruise, you can go if you can make it by one o'clock.  I
 made it, we went on that cruise, it was very nice.
\par Q: Where, where did you go?
\par A: To the, to Nassau, to the Bahamas.  It was very nice, and then I went to Russia to attend the wedding of my brother-in-law's daughter.  And what else did I do?  And then got 
enrolled in a, in a soap distribution.  I used to sell cleaning products, and finally I went downtown and I saw the way that people are dressed, the people -- young, young kids.  It gave me an idea to start an antique clothing store, clothing from forties
 and thirties, and I open up that store and since I'm a furrier, I was handling also furs.  Became quite successful and I was able to purchase the building and was doing financially, financially very nice and at home, things weren't that great.
\par Q: Why?  What was...
\par A: I did, I didn't know that my wife is looking for her physical satisfaction somewhere else.  I didn't know.  I thought she doesn't need men, she's cold.  But, so she had a fling here and there.  I didn't know to any extent, until about 19, in th
e eighties, I got my married, my daughter married, naturally made a beautiful wedding.  She has two children now.  About 1987, my wife met a, a person who was homeless.  I mean, partially, practically homeless.  She was taking advantage of many people and
 
she open up the door for her, to bring her in here.  Slept on the floor and tried to manipulate my wife, a very shrewd person, very shrewd.  I will not mention the names, but when the time comes I have to, I have to.  And she used to convince my wife that
 it's all right to see other people, you know, kind of help her, bringing her up to some, to some, to some point, and at the same time tried to take money from her.  \'93Borrow me here, borrow me there, borrow me here,\'94 and \'93
don't worry, do what you have to do, I'll take care of him.\'94  And she was so shrewd, she convinced her.  She brainwashed her and you know, but I didn't like her, her...
\par Q: And she was living in the apartment?
\par A: That's right and I didn't like her mouth.  Very, very bad mouth, so one day I w
rote her a letter that if -- that she should leave us, leave our life and go, you know, and at that time when my, when my, my daughter left for, for California, I had the relapse.  Because in 1983, I had a car accident and I had a disc, a herniated disk, 
but with exercise, and I fell into a depression when my daughter left me.  And when I told this woman to go, she start begging me, \'93don't, don't.\'94
  My wife says, "Leave her alone, leave her alone, she's okay, you know, she helps out."  I didn't know that my
 wife is using her as a cover-up, as a cover.  Well, then when she pumped out from my wife whatever she could, she went to work on me, you know.  "Oh, you're so nice, your wife is going to Florida, everything is fine, no worry, she cooked for me, she made
 me meals," and all that, and she says, \'93oh you're like my father and I give my life for you," and blah, blah, blah, talk and talk and talk a lotta nonsense.  But one day she says, "Do you ever cheat on your wife?"  I says, "No I don't.\'94
  Why?  Because, wel
l, I had a complex because my wife used to reject me, so I didn't have the, the, the, the courage to approach other women, because I couldn't stand rejection.  So I said, "No, I don't do it," and, and we left it at that.  And then again, and again, and ag
a
in, when she couldn't take anymore money from my wife, she started, "Oh, I need an apartment, I need this, you help me."  Okay, so I helped -- a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred dollars there, and then she dropped, when she saw the moment is ripe, 
you know, that I am so depressed, she dropped a bombshell on me.  She says, "You never cheat on your wife?"  I says, "No, does she?"  She says, "Yeah.  You know this and this guy?"  "Well, I think I do."  And she told me, let's go, let\rquote s go, let
\rquote s go to a d
etective office and I know exactly when and where she can be caught with this man.  And she used to take telephone and put my wife together with that man.  I mean, she plotted the whole thing.  And, naturally, I go to this detective and I give a deposit, 
a
nd she tells him exactly when and where -- they get caught.  They get caught, I got grounds for divorce.  Right?  I got grounds for divorce.  But here, I'm a wealthy man.  See?  So she says, "She's going to take everything away from you.  Why don't you tr
ansfer it to me?"  Transfer the building, you know, and make promises everywhere, \'93I do it for him because of my love and whenever he wants it I'll give it back to him,\'94
 you know?  And she says, I says, "I want to make a settlement.  Give her so much and so
 much to my wife."  She says, "No, no, no.  You'll give her as little as possible and leave the rest to me."  Anyway, she manipulated my brain, she manipulated her brains and I was then under so much depression I used to take tranquilizers, Xanax, you kno
w
?  And whenever I got depressed, she even had these pills in her bag and she used to give me, just to keep me calm.  And she dragged me to a lawyer.  Naturally, I signed over everything, you know, with a promise she is going to give it back to me, just be
c
ause she put my wife on the telephone and she spoke to her and I heard her say, "Oh, okay.  If he's going to find out, gonna to be divorced.  I'm going to take everything and find myself a young lover and live my life."  She prepared all that and I should
 
hear it.  So, of course, that aggravated me.  So, I didn't want that to happen, that she should get everything.  Whatever stocks she had, she made her sell and give me a check.  I'm telling you, she took the building and hundreds of thousands of dollars a
n
d all that, and she was nice to me.  She gave me a few years that I never had in my life.  Actually the divorce went through.  Right?  She gave me, you know, and always money here, money there.  And when the money start, you know, there was nothing much t
o
 give, she kind of pulled off and she looked somewhere else.  So here comes along a woman friend that we knew together, that is in the process of dying, you know, of cancer.  And so she went to work on her. "Oh, I'm gonna to be for you here.  I'm gonna to
 
help you."  This and that, and that poor woman had a, had a bad relationship with her only son.  She left with a second husband.  For years, she couldn't get along with her son.  However, her son has three children, very poor, and he made a bat mitzvah fo
r
 her, for his daughter, and me and this person were invited and he didn't speak to his mother.  His mother was dying of cancer.  He didn't speak to her.  But there come a moment when they were playing the hora, you know, dancing the hora.  So he is -- the
 
boy -- dancing the hora.  I take his hand and his mother comes in.  So I joined the hands of his mother and the boy and I say, "It's time."  So they got together and start talking, you know?  But in the meantime this woman get sick. So this person, again,
 start to brainwash this woman.  "Get away from your husband."  Blah, blah, blah.  "I take care of you."  And so sh\emdash  this woman made her the executive, you know?
\par Q: So, so you said, but you said before that there are, there were a couple of years that, that it was okay, that\emdash

She started to neglect me completely and I wasn't happy because I saw then, I realize, I saw, and this woman used to fa\emdash 
 the sick woman used to fall into a coma.  And one time she woke up, she says, "Erwin, I hope she's not going to do to my son what she di

n

home three, four o'clock in the morning, five o'clock and run back."  I says, "I don't feel good.  I, I, I had chest pain and I had to go to emergency."  She says, "Well, I'm not going to worry about you now."

 had the control of all your money and...
\par A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.  Well, and why I trusted her, people also ask me why I trusted her.  My depression led to a heart bypass, to an operation.  So I go to the hospital.  My wife didn't have the t
ime to go with me to the hospital, because she told her, "It's okay, you don't have to go.  I'll take care of him."  Now, before I go down to operation, before I close my eyes, I don't see my wife, I see her.  When I come out, I don't see my wife, I see h
er.  So, I mean that's how she plotted everything and that's how she made me trust her in full.  You understand?  So now, go back to this woman and so...
\par Q: I just was wondering about the, I was a little concerned about the [tape skippeed].
\par A: This woman wo
uld argue back and forth.  I says, "Look, you always promised, whenever I want the building, whatever money I gave, I mean hundreds of thousands of dollars, now I have nothing."  I says, "Just transfer the building back to me."  Because she took a big mor
t
gage on the building also and messed it up.  I took a mortgage of this apartment I gave her.  Now I'm responsible for it.  She says, "I'm not giving it back.  I'm not giving back nothing.  I give, I gave you, I took care of you."  Well, naturally I starte
d
 a litigation.  I started a litigation and we came to a settlement that she, she will pay me for the building like -- on the time of transaction, somebody advised her that it couldn't be just like this.  She got to kind of make a sale, so 160,000 dollars,
 
she gave me a second mortgage.  I wasn't aware that it's so powerful.  She says, "The only thing you can get, you can get payments on the mortgage."  So, well, we agreed on that.  She made a few payments and then she, she defaulted on payments.  So now I'
m in litigation again with her, and she's such a person so vicious, you know.  Wha\emdash  on every sentence, there's threat, she's threatening, oh, she'll do something, \'93
I'm going to destroy him, my mother, my mother will come.  She's going to make his family disappear.\'94
  Threatening and threatening and threatening.  And that's where it's at now.  I was a rich man and she, she made me a poor man.  She's holding everything and wouldn't give it back, and now we're in litigation, and she took her mortgage and the ban
k is foreclosing on her also, because I put a sheriff to collect the rents, so there's no income.
\par Q: Could you, could you tell me about -- I wonder if -- do you see any relationship between how -- what happened with this person and the earlier events of, o
f your life?  Perhaps in terms of what happened with you with, with  the, the -- your relationship with your wife and, and, you know, you said that she, you felt that she was, she was cold and\emdash 
\par A: Yeah.
\par Q: I mean do you think that just happened because, you know, because of the relationship or is there something about your earlier experiences that may have\emdash ?
\par A: Well, I don't know about what happened with my earlier experiences, because I thought that I was the happiest man in the world, you know, I was marr
ied for over forty years and I kept my wife on the pedestal, and in everybody's eyes we were the perfect couple, the perfect example.  Everything is nice, so maybe she, she had a fling here and there somewhere, which is, I don't know, it might be, it migh
t
 be natural, or not.  But naturally, I wasn't happy at home -- very happy -- because she was not very attentive.  Like I had to go to a doctor for a, for a angiogram report.  She did not have time to go with me.  And these little things bugged me very muc
h
 and I felt an oppression.  When I divorced her, you know, and this one was here -- came to my life.  I mean, I was treated like a king, I must say.  My juice was squeezed freshly in the morning.  Right?  My clothes was always prepared, what I should wear
 
today, what shall I wear tomorrow, the best food.  It took me on a trip to Europe, to Italy.  I mean, the burden is on me now, because she falsified my signature on the credit cards and all that, the burden is on me.  But she opened up my eyes.  I, I saw 
things that I have never seen.  But it wa\emdash  everything was planned, everything was, was planned in a, in a, in a most vicious way.
\par Q: What do you mean that she opened your eyes with just things?
\par A: She showed me a world that I have never seen.  I mean, she g
ave me love.  She gave me compassion.  She, she opened up her heart and her body to me in a way that I have never, never experienced, and, and I was happy, you know, I was happy and I had a good life, until I saw that all was material, you know?  As long 
as there was money coming from here, some stock here, some bonds here and then she got everything -- there was nothing more to gain, to get, and she needed it.  She could spend thousands in a day.
\par Q: Did you talk to her about, tell her about your earlier exp\'85experiences, about your time in camps and\'85?
\par A: Yes I told her, but she, she, she wouldn't -- she doesn't believe in Holocaust and that she doesn't believe in it.  She says, "Oh, yeah, even you're acting when you talk about the Holocaust.  It's not true."
 You know, that's in a fight or -- later I understand why. Because she was married to a German and then she was married to an Arab, so it's a good combination to, to be anti-Semitic. 
\par Q: Do you think that that was something, that, that she felt, \'93Well, you were a Jew and so it was\emdash \'94
\par A: I don't know why.  But this was apparently, this was her, her way of life, to get things out of other people.  Because now, it clears my puzzle, because when she just came into our life, she used to ask my wife if she could g
et 10,000 dollars.  Because when she left Europe, she shipped a lot of antiques to San Francisco, which are in storage -- you know -- and unless she gets it out, it will be auctioned off.  So apparently she ripped off somebody else over there.
\par Q: How old is she?
\par A: She is now about 35, 36, 38. I don't know.
\par Q: And she was from Europe originally?
\par A: Yeah.
\par Q: Tell me about your daughter.  Tell me about your daughter.
\par A: My daughter's my best thing that happened to me.   She's, I mean, the way she wrote this poem, we, we are very close.  She's very against her mother -- very much of what, what she did, and now she says, \'93Now she's a woman, now it comes back also.
\'94  Because she say, as a small child, my wife was never, she was never, she was never a mother, she 
was never a wife.  The child was in first grade, all she had is a string with her keys on her neck.  She had to go from school to this neighbor, to this neighbor, to this neighbor, to this neighbor.  I had to manage, to close my restaurant, my luncheonett
e, as early as possible so I could run home and catch her, so I could be with her.  When the child woked up at, at night and she never, she never cried out \'93Mommy,\'94 she always cried out \'93Poppy.\'94
  So up to this day I was always for her.  You should see the letters she writes to me, you know, so my experience with my daughter is very, very, very, very close, very close, very good, and my two little grandbabies, I mean, that's my life.
\par Q: Can you tell me about the, you showed me the poem earlier.  I wonder if\emdash 
\par A:  Yeah.
\par Q:  \'85you could tell me\emdash 
\par A:  Yes.
\par Q:  \'85about what, about what she wrote and, and how that, how that happened -- she gave it to you?
\par A: How that happened?  She was, she was here in 1989.  Her husband's brother got married on a wedding.  And I think
 that, about that time, the Holocaust experience started to come out of the people, because we hold it, we were all holding it very, very suppressed.
\par Q: What time was this?  Was it like...
\par A: That was 1989.  Prior to that, my daughter would never want to hear about the Holocaust.  I mean, it didn't ring the bell.  But then, one day she, she watched a movie, "The Last Solution}{\cs33\super\insrsid2580002 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

together and I don't know what it was, maybe I was, I was preparing an interview or something and I had an idea, "Why don't you write something, your experiences?  What do you think about your father?," I ask her.  So befo
re she left, just scribble up on a little paper, to express feelings about me.  So that's how she did it.
\par Q: So tell me about what, what you meant, that, that up until 80 -- late, mid -- late \lquote 80s that you kept a\emdash ?
\par A: Couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, it was t
oo painful.  Couldn't talk, because many times, going back again to the, to the -- with this person and my wife, I used to -- even now I have nightmares, you know?  It's never escapes my mind.  I'm seeing a psychiatrist, even at this time now, I just, you
 
know.  I wake up or I don't, I have to sit home and I cry, you know, because it, it haunts me all the time.  So I used to wake up and cried, I cried at night, at sleep.  My wife wouldn't come in.  This person came in to wake me and calm me.  And prior to 
that person, when she came to our life, my, my, my girl -- my daughter was sleeping here and she heard me and she didn't know what's what, and that's how she expressed herself here.
\par Q: So your daughter would -- wasn't she, she wasn't aware that when she was growing up, there was -- you know -- you were, you were still haunted by this experience?  Or she didn't know that you were going\'85?
\par A: We didn't talk about it very much.  But only later on when I used to have those nightmares. Because before this we lived
 in a two bedroom apartment somewhere else, she has her own bedroom so she couldn't hear.  But, yes, she heard me crying and she used to run, "Daddy, Daddy, what is it, what is it, what is it?"  And I woke up in a cold sweat.
\par Q: And you would tell her?
\par A: I tell her that I just had this nightmare, this dream, of what was happening to me and then there, there was...
\par Q: And how did she resp\emdash  what, what -- and how did she respond?
\par A: Well she, I don't know how she took it because she never expressed her feelin
gs to me.  Because if you tell your story to somebody, it's to the other person, it's just like reading a book. It doesn't affect you very much because you did not live it.  You see, us, survivors, you know?  I'm talking to you and somehow I can not touch
 
upon the, the feeling that it happened to me, you know?  Because it was so tragic, so awful, what I went through, that it's just humanly impossible to comprehend, you know?  So it's just like reading a book about somebody's experience.  So you cannot expe
c
t anybody to have any, any feelings about it.  Only it's being bombarded to the minds now, second generation and third generation are getting, you know, the, the, the, the experiences of the -- of their beloved is getting soaked into their, into their bra
ins and, and the fear emerges, \'93God forbid it should happen to my children.\'94  because a teenager will not feel it unless they have their own children and start to be afraid of what will happen to their children.  Because seeing movies, \'93
Schindler's List,\'94 o
r reading books, or, or talking like I used to talk.  I don't know if she heard me or not.  That, that, that, that, that, that I watched them -- my sister, they told her to, to, to, to give the child, she wouldn't give the child so, so, so the guy pulled

It just lingers on and on and on and on.  Like I talk to my psychiatrist. He says, "You have to try to get away.  I says, "How?"  No matter where I go, I come to you, I speak about it.  I go to my doctor.  I sit on, on a bus, on a subway, have a conversat

til the next visit.  You see, like I have to see my ther

 on those Prozac pills.  But it doesn't do much to me, you see.  I learned to accept, because I can't switch it off.  No matter what I do, I can't switch it off.
\par Q: What do you mean?  What, what can't you switch off?
\par A: The memories, the haunting, I can't s

Warsaw, my mother had two sisters in another part of town or a hundred kilometers from, from Warsaw, where the hunger was not so great and there was a little bit possibilities for food.  But a lot of people found out and a lot of people came.  So one nigh
t

em and walked them through, without being beaten.  So the other ones knew where to go.  Came the turn of my older sister, she got beaten up like don't ask.  Came my turn, I was small boy, I got a long coat, and I was running like a snake, you know?  And a

Q: So, so those -- but you said that you can't turn off the memories of those.
\par A: Yeah.
\par Q: So it's not just that things remind you of those, that they're always just there.
\par A: Yes, they're always there, yeah.
\par Q: Do you think about them, do you think more now than you used to when\'85?
\par A: Well, I cannot, I cannot, I mean it's always there, more or less it's always there.  You know, a certain part of my life is now, five minutes something else can come about.  All
 depends of the, of the environment where I am.  If I see, if I see, for instance, a river, comes to my mind, oh yes, in Warsaw, Poland we were living not far from a river, you know, and people used to pass by to play tennis and stop by, buy some candy, s
o
me cigarettes from my, from my mother.  And then I see a small house, I remind myself of a little village where my aunt used to live, with a, with a straw roof.  I used to go every summer.  And if I hear the, the, the, the Ukrainian language, I, I get fru
strated, I start shivering.  Then, then, then it all comes back.  When I hear even a Jew speak German, oh my God, you know?  Polish I can't stand.  So it's everything connects to everything immediately, like I'm involved in everything, everything.
\par Q: What do you mean?
\par A: Like ever\'85everything  -- how can I express?  Open up the TV.  Most of, most of what you see is shooting, right?  So, I saw it everyday of my life.
\par Q: So what is that...how does that...
\par A: That brings me that I witness those sceneries -- that affects me.  Hanging, you know, I remember.  Why, why hanging?  Because three men, one of them I knew very well, Leon Fo\'85
Fox, he was working in the barrack of clothing, he distributed clothing.  And because of the clothing, he could find for himself nice 
civilian clothes, and in the clothing he'd find dollars and, and gold coins and he was able to bribe the SS to get him out of the camp.  So him and two others escaped.  But Auschwitz was no such a thing as escaping.  One day, two days, three days, four da
ys, they caught \lquote em and brought \lquote em back.  And here they hang \lquote em in front of everybody, you know?  So when I see any hanging in a cowboy film, you know, that comes back.
\par Q: Do you think that you're -- in the choices that you made in your life in terms of the kinds of things you were doing or that you wanted to do, I mean did you ever -- do you feel like that you were able to do what you wan\'85
wanted to do or would have liked to do?
\par A: I was\emdash 
\par Q: I guess like when I was growing up or most kids, when they're growing up,  you know, they have these dreams of what they want to be, and in a way if you didn't have that chance -- how do you, you know -- I mean\'85
\par A: Well, I was successful of doing what I wanted to do, you know, even, even though in the camp, even though in the camp}{\fs28\insrsid2580002 \'85}{\insrsid2580002 
.  When they put us to Auschwitz and there was Russian and there was  hunger, so to me it was no big deal.  What else is new?  I was hungry before the war.  Before I went to this orphanage, I was hungry.  So here it was already at least you gua
ranteed a few meals a day.  Now, there were good days, there were bad days in the camps.  When there were good days, was fine.  When it was bad days, we used to talk.  So they asked me -- they used to call me Bubi because I was the youngest there -- "Bubi
 
what do you think?  Are we gonna to survive?  Are we going to make it?"  I says, "I will.  I don't know, you."  I had that in my mind, implanted somehow.  When they put the numbers, swear to God, you know, I should have learned this from my children, I'll
 talk to my brothers, \'93You know, we're gonna to show this in the United States.\'94
  I didn't even know if there is a United States.  I thought there's Warsaw, there's Poland, that's it.  I didn't even know.  So I had that, how shall I say it?  The foresight of surviving, of getting out of it, you know?
\par Q: Do you feel that you still, I mean especially given the troubles you've had recently, do you still have a sense of that, that, of that foresight of survival, that you'll get through and\'85?
\par A: Oh yes, oh yes.
\par Q: Is that helpful to you still?
\par A: Yes, it helps me to get through.  You see, what a person did to me, you know?  And, somehow, I learned to live with it.  Although I'm litigation, I'm going to get something out of it.  I know I will.  I know I will survi
ve, somehow.  See, thanks God, I'm not in too poor health.  I'm gonna to be 70 years old, you know.  I have my daughter.  I have my two brothers.  See, I don't know what to ask out of life more, because of what I didn't have. 
\par Q: What do you mean?
\par A: Like, like, like I say, I was hungry before the war.  Now, thanks God, my refrigerator is full of food, you know.  I'm seeing a few people around me that are very, very nice to me, you know.  I'm invited fo\emdash 
 to dinners and here and there.  I go to synagogue twi
ce a week.  I'm very close to the Rabbi, although I cannot pay any membership.  But someday I will, you know?  I always hope that, that, that, that, you know, God will let me enjoy the rest of my years as peaceful, as normal as possible and do the best I 
can.
\par Q: Do you think that over the course of, of your life that you, that you, that you -- that hadn't made -- you know, what you said about how you -- because you didn't have any food and that just having food, having food was enough and to be able to sust
ain yourself is enough\'85
\par A: That was the dream in the camp.  What was, what, what was our dream?  Our dream -- like most of us, when there was a day off like Sunday, we didn't work, we were able to be in camp.  Outside the camp, we didn't see it. But while 
in camp, we saw the fire above the chimney going very, very high, because of the fat of the human flesh.  Not only there was the, the, the -- how you call -- the, the smog, but the fire.  And in people's mind, well, one day, what do you want before that h
a
ppens?  Enough bread, just bread to satisfy your hunger and then I don't care what happens.  Like before they execute a person, your last wish, that was our last wish.  Now what I would, now what I, my only regret is, which I'm angry, why didn't my wife l
et me go 25 years ago?  If I wasn't what she wanted me, I could have remarried.  My daughter always cried out, "Why don't I have a sister or a brother?"  I could have give her all that.  That's my, that's my, that\rquote 
s my pain.  That's what I'm angry.  And then, sometimes, I have an argument with God, to have an argument with him.
\par Q: What do you mean?
\par A: Why, why did he take away my, my beloved?  I mean my father had to die, he was 48 years old, he was a sick man.  The war broke out, my mother was only 50 years old.  One of my sisters had a little boy, two years old, I mean young.  Why did he take 
\lquote em all away and left me with all this hurt, this feelings?  And then I forgive him.  Sometimes I have not, then I forgive him.  Well, somebody had to remain to, to, to tell the story.  It shouldn't repeat itself.
\par Q: Do you ever question or think about how, how it is that people can be evil to that extent, or how people can\'85?  Did that ever -- is that something that happened then, or that you thought about -- that you think about since then?
\par A: Circumstances brings it to them.  How could people do it?  Right?  Germany before the war, I mean now I'm big scholar.  What did I know?  Germany before the war was in big depression.  Right?  No work, no food, no nothing.  Here c
omes Hitler.  Prosperity starts, everybody has everything, then he builds the Volkswagen for them.  Whatever he does is right.  So he says, "The Jews are our enemies.  They're no good.  It's their fault.  They wanted the war.  We have to get rid of 
\lquote em."
\par Q: But what is it about?  I guess I\rquote m thinking about, do you ever think about what it is about certain, certain people, that allows them to do things that are, you know, horrendous?
\par A: Well, something, something penetrates to the mind, that dictates them it's the right thing to do.  See?
\par Q: But all the things -- I mean the things -- some of the, the things that you've seen, experienced, how could, how could anyone even justify that?

A: Yeah, people think it's the right thing to do.  Like this person, you kno
w, who did so, so bad to me, took, you know, made me penniless.  And this poor women, you know, took money from her and then she says to her son, "You know, I have to put some money on your account."  So she put money on his account.  Then she says, "You 
k
now something?  You better withdraw the cash and let me hold it for you because your wife will leave you and get off, you'll have nothing."  So the boy gives it to her, you know?  He trusts her, because she's so manipulating.  And now a year and a half la
ter, the boy ask her -- you know, they also had the fight -- he ask her, "Are you ever going to give me the money?"  She says that I got it, that I took it, you know?  And then the poor boy believes it.  So\'85
some people that can manipulate other people's bra
in to do the right thing, and she thinks she does the right thing.  Because she spend with me those few years, you know, I deserve that she should make me penniless and not give me back nothing.  So it's very hard, it's very hard to say why, why people ho
l
d up other people, why people rape other people, why people kill other people.  It's another sickness.  Why, why, why people do good thing to people?  You see?  Like when I, I go back and I think, I good, I good -- I did good things, even while I was hung
r
y, I did good things.  And there are people up to this day, thanks God, to verify it, you know.  While we were working in camp, there was a certain Kommando.  We used to clean up, it was called the clean-up commander like.  People came by transport.  They
 had to leave all the luggage and everything and we used to put it on trucks and then go to the other location.  We sorted clothes here, this, that and a big b\'85
box, put the money in there.  But while helping the people coming off the train, there was a few 
boys of us, what told us to do, I don't know.  But when we saw a woman, in the 60s, a woman in the 20s, 30s, holding a child, we asked them, "Please have the child -- let your mother hold it."  Why?  A woman with a ch\emdash 
 an old woman had no chance, had to go
.  She was no, no, no good for labor.  She had to go to gas chambers.  A woman with a child -- because no children, no babies in camp -- go to gas chambers.  But if we took the child and give to the older woman, we save the young woman -- she went to camp
.
  Who told us to do?  Why?  No reason.  We did it.  There is one, there is one instant I experienced that I shall never forget for until I close my eyes.  The end of 1944, Hungarian transports used to come.  Two thousand day, 2,000 at night.  I mean the c
rematoriums were so busy, they couldn't acc\'85
accommodate all this killings.  So they dug big, big holes, put people on the truck and straight in the fire.  Here comes this transport at night and we're getting called out.  I mean, I was hard as a rock over th
ere. I didn't care, because I knew it might happen to me.  If my cousin, whoever came, I knew he was going to die.  Only looked if he has a piece of bread.  Like from France or Belgium, they came.  They used to bring sardines.  We wanted a piece of salami
. What happened to him will happen anyways.  But here comes a transport and I do my thing.  I see a girl, 18 years old, whether it was her baby or not her baby, I don't know.  I say to, in Yiddish, \'93Gib dos kind tzu di mameh, un kim mit mir.\'94}{

A: Yes, it was.  It was very important to me to have a child, because I always wanted a family.  Because being, being from a family of seven, you know, and then I have a -- my, my brothers, like one brother has two children, the other brother has three ch

\par Q: Did they have any, did the people who do investigations, the people in the adoption agency were interested in you and...
\par A: They were, yeah, but not directly to me.  They were speaking to other people.

\par A: My character, my character, my character, and if I'm, if I\rquote

 I was in driving school business with him, he's still there.  When what happened with my wife, I kind of closed the doors.  I didn't want to speak to nobody, because of -- I don't want \lquote 
em to start pumping me with questions.  Because I wanted this chapter, I want it to be forgotten.  But then I figure, \'93These people didn't do me any wrong.  They always inquire about me.  It's time to get out of the closet.\'94
  So while I was in my brother's house, I invited two of my closest friends.  Ah, well [indecipherable] you cannot.  So we start to talk and they told me, you know.  "You know, when you were adopting Mona, they came to us to vouch for you and they
 asked me, 'What do you think Mr. Baum?  Is he going to make a good father?'"  They said, "Of course, he's going to make a wonderful father."  "How about, is she going to make a good mother?"  And the answer was, "Mr. Baum will be a very good father."   Y

\par Q: So they had the feeling already then?
\par A: They have a feeling, yeah, that she wasn't much.  But things got, that, that was my, my luckiest break, you know, to, to have her.

 wouldn't escape me. It wouldn't escape me, especially, especially to see people who do have family, because right after the war, people came from Russia, people came out of hiding and here were those families.  Where are, where are mine?  See?  One of my
 youngest, one of my sisters, went to Russia in 1941.  She went deep into Russia.  Now, there were mil\emdash 
 thousands and thousands coming out of Russia and I cannot find her.  And I'm sure the Germans didn't get where she was, because one year later after she 
went, she wrote us a postcard.  We got one postcard.  She and her husband.  "Oh, we are in, in Siberia, voluntarily."  Because my brother-in-law was working as a mechanic for Singer Sewing Machines and she was learning to be, to -- as a welder.  So, they

used to work as a cashier in a bakery before the war.  Whatever money she make, she used to take me to amusement park, on rides and buy me pastry and all that -- and I don't have her.
\par Q: So, so you'd say you think you were kind of trying to disguise it.
\par A: 
I disguise it, you know, I inflict fake happiness.  You know what that means?  Fake happiness.  Because loneliness is a terrible thing, especially when holidays come  about. You know, that's why I run at least to be with my brothers, you know, because thi

o invite people, kids that were in the orphanage by Dr. Korczak.  It was 75 years of existence of the home.  Naturally, I was invited.  I go with my friend David}{\cs33\super\insrsid2580002 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

 from, from California.  I go there and, naturally, we go -- first of all we go to
 visit the home.  So I walk in to the, to the home, where there were my happiest time I spend there.  Five meals a day.  I was hungry before the war.  There were five meals a day.  You know what that means?  Clean clothes, clean beds.  I mean, respect at 
the school.  "Oh, this boy's from Korczak."  Respect.  I walk in.  First of all, I take a look.  There was this big, big armoire we had and everybod\'85
 every kid had a drawer with a number.  This is gone, feeling like you were a little boy and you had your fa
vorite toy.  They take it, but they give it to you back broken.  You know what I mean?  That feeling surrounds me.  But anyway, time for introduction and \'93Oh, I'm from there, I'm from there, I'm from there.\'94
  All the kids that were there, were already prio
r to me and were out before the war, because they accepted children from seven to 14.  After 14, they went --  Dr. Korczak gave them two suits, pair of shoes, a job and a room -- room for next one.  They were all gone.  I was the last one to be in the per
iod with Dr. Korczak together.  Now I hear people come to introduce themselves, \'93I am so and so, and I am so and so.\'94
  And here comes this tall, skinny man in the 70s.  He says, "My name is Aleksander, Misza, Aleksander, but they used to call me Szura."  No
w, Mr. Shapiro, if there would be a hole I would fall right in there.  This was my Mr. Szura.  He was my counselor.  He used to do my homework with me.  When there was a parent meeting, he used to go for me.  So -- you know?  And I showed him one of the p
i
cture and he recognized me.  Now, we embraced and hugged.  Unbelievable, you know?  I found somebody that was, like, very close to me.  And of course we go in the hall, we sit down and everybody gets assigned to, to a seat at table.  Now, why would I get 
assigned at a table where I was, where I was as a child there, at the same chair, they made me sit there, you know?  They didn't know.  Kind of a coincidence.  And then we start telling stories about experience, you know -- what --  \'93
Who knew Walter (ph) Korczak?\'94 and I says, \'93I remember Dr. Korczak of two, two special events.\'94  One nice one, and one not so good.  The nice one was that Dr. Korczak was very, very much conc\'85
conscious about the kids eating.  He used to walk around and make sure that the child e
ats.  Walk around, so.  The child takes a piece of bread, takes a bite and he holds it, so he used to grab from the piece of bread, put it in his mouth as a joke, as a gesture.  The second moment, war broke out, the bombs are falling, no food.  But Dr. Ko
rczak managed to bring always a little bit more.  Now, here it says on the blackboard, \'93Two slices of bread each.\'94
  Everybody gets two slices of bread.  Dr. Korczak gets two slices of bread.  What happens?  He gives this two slices of bread everyday to anot
her child.  Doesn't eat.  You know?  Things like that.  And then they took us -- I want to come back about the cemetery -- they took us to visit the camps.  Visit the camps, and then the thing was over and I tell to my friend David -- since we hired this 
Polish guy with a car, with a Mercedes -- \'93Why not go to Auschwitz?\'94  I want to got to Auschwitz, to Birke\'85
, where I was.  I didn't know why, you know?  Although I, I knew why, because I was never -- I did never feel liberated.  Because, when I was a child,
 they push me into camp, you know?  I had to go in and the thing was closed.  Like in the, in the, in the, in the country -- in the small villages, if a train has to pass, they have a kind of, to close off the road.
\par Q: A gate, kind of.
\par A: Yeah, on a pole, that's what they close, I couldn't get out.  Here I go to Auschwitz and I walk in, because I want to walk in.  Right?  I walked in, I go to, to the crematoria, I say my kaddish}{\cs33\super\insrsid2580002 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

\par Q:  \'85your whole life before that?
\par A: I felt different before, because -- why?  Because I know the Russians liberated the camps.  Their object was to liberate the camps.  Unfortunately, our American people, they had no orders to liberate the camp.  They went to occupy the territo

ake us, they left us.  So I didn't feel I was liberated.  They came in, they took away the camp.  I went to the hospital.  So I never felt like they came in for the purpose of liberating us.
\par Q: I was surprised about that -- about the hospital -- that they -- what kind of hospital was it that they would -- just a civilian German hospital?
\par A: Civilian German hospital, yeah.  Matter of fact, there was a German lying next to me.  He didn't get nothing, you know, because there was no food. But for me, was -- there was a Jewish administrator already placed in there, you know.

\par A: I didn't know then, because when I met her, you know, three months later we were marrie
d.  Three months later we were married and then some pity, pity overtook me, because she had a stepfather -- you know, and they were in Haifa, only one room, there was not much room -- and her stepfather kind of pushed her to get married, no matter who it
 
is.  So one day, she, she used to tell me, she got together with a, with a -- that boy, you know.  And a wedding was arranged to take place like a day or next day, and then she broke out in tears to her mother, "Mom, I don't love him.  I can't, I can't." 
So her mother says, "Okay, you don't love him, don't get married."  And when she met me, there was love, I think she loved me too, but it was, it was different.  It was different, you know, we're two -- we're qui\'85
quite comparable and I must say I'm a person that -- I'm a, I\rquote 
m a giver -- always giving, always giving.  I mean when I, when I used to go with her to a party, no matter if I came home dead tired from, from my work, I made sure that she's being served together -- the smorgasbord, whatever -- I make 
a plate first for her.  You know, always kept her on a pedestal.  And she was a taker.
\par Q: Are you, are you a religious man at all, or\emdash ?
\par A: No, not religious, but confused, you know, because sometimes, where was he? You know?  And then when I'm in trouble, I'm turning to him, \'93God, help, God help me please.\'94  And, sinc\'85
since a couple years, I started to attend synagogue and that makes me feel good.
\par Q: Why?  What makes you feel good?
\par A: I have no, I have no idea.  Becau\'85because it's my like

\par Q: But you said you were, there's some confusion, that you're confused in some sense about God.
\par A: I'm confused
 about God -- of, of seeing things happen that should not happen, you know.  I was touched by it personally, you know?  But then I don't know whether it was his fault or it was -- but I always turn to him.  I always turn to him, I always turn to him.   Is
 -- Well, well you can be mad at your father also, you know.  \'93Why, why did you do this?  Why?\'94 And then when you need him, you go to him.

\par Q: Do you have any notion of an afterlife or\emdash ?
\par A: No, not really, not really, you know, it's gone, it's gone.  There should
 be some indication there is something.  Nobody, nobody came back, so, I mean it would be so good, some beloved would come, hey don't worry, come and join us or are they so selfish, you know?  \'93
It's there for me, I'm afraid there's no more room for anybody else.\'94
\par Q: Do you have -- have you ever had a sense that after what you had been through -- I mean it seems that you were able to at least have a sense for yourself that life was worth living, that there were things that were, you know -- you wanted to hav
e children, you wanted to have, have work and build a comfortable life for yourself, a career for yourself and\emdash ?
\par A: Yeah, sure, li\'85life was worth living.  God, God gave me, God gave me a gift of life and I took the best advantage I knew how and I had good 
times.  Like I said, I became very, very successful, although it went down the drain.  I don't know whether it was God's will or it was, it was kind of a vicious act of somebody, to take advantage of the situation when, when I was going through heart surg
e
ry and I was going through a depression --  but, but that, that's okay.  But again I turn to God and I say that God, in his way, will punish the guilty and award the, the one that's being mistreated.  I believe that somehow everything will come to an end 
and it will straighten itself out when I'll be on my feet again and be able to go see my children as often as I can, which is -- this is my priority.
\par Q: Do you think it's easier for you to be friends with other survivors because you have this kind of common\emdash 
\par A: Not only that's in common, I'm a easy person to, to have friends, I'm -- you know, I must say, if I make acquaintance with somebody, they seem to like me immediately because I'm so easy going -- very, very easy.  I don't complain, I don't criticize.

\par Q: What do you feel -- do you think people felt like after the experiences in camps?  That they had nothing to lose at that point or\emdash ?
\par A: Well, first of all, nothing to lose.  Then, second, was a challenge, the challenge to be in the army among your own.  Because before the war, if Jewish boys were supposed to be drafted to the Polis

 we were trying to get out.  By all means, we were trying to get out. So, you know, that, that we were not stable, we were not stable, you see.  Couldn't call a home, Germany.  Some people went to Poland, back.  They were killed there, right?  In 1956, th

  And then you came -- then, then you saw a different story; where there are two Jews, three opinions.  It was, was very hard.
\par Q: Have you ever thought of going back there since then?
\par A: To live there
?  Well, if my daughter would go, I would probably go to live, yeah.  My, my late friend that passed away, he, he bought a condominium there and we were planning to be together, spend a lot of time together in Israel -- maybe I would live there.  But now 
they are as they are -- they are already 3,000 miles away from me and to go to live there, I would be too far again from them, so\'85

\par Q: Do you, do you ever talk with your brothers about your experiences?
\par A: Only, only, yeah, only experiences and\emdash

\'85,\'94 then, then we go on, we go on with experiences.
\par Q: Just remembering\emdash ?
\par A: Remembering -- repeating the experiences, yeah.  Like my oldest brother, my oldest 
brother Edyl, he, he had worse than all of us because he is a nosy person, you know, he walks around.  So when we came to Auschwitz, he started walking around and I always -- I said, "Let's be together, so when they put our numbers we have \lquote

  But he wandered off, half an hour later I don't see him.  And months later we find out that they took him to another camp called Jawischowitz coal m

new that nobody's left; I have no brothers, I have no sisters, I have no family.  And I was young and I starting to getting attracted, you know -- my strength came back, you know -- I wanted to be with girls, and\emdash 
\par Q: So when did the, when did the -- you know, when did you start having dreams?
\par A: After I got married, after I got married -- after, after I got married, I mean in Israel, you know, when I was settled already -- I mean not hustling, not running, you know?  Went, went to Canada and start working --
 doing one thing and you know, you sit on a sewing machine and you sew, so you just don't see this -- you think.  And what woke me up actually, in Montreal there was an, an, an, an, an, an advertising in that paper that there's a theater -- a piece playin
g
 about Dr. Korczak.  Of course, I went to see that, you know?  I went to see that and that play did not make any sense whatsoever, not what happened there, you know?  With the small child -- baby -- there was no babies, nothing.  So after that I went on t
he stage and I says, \'93You made a play -- I'm a survivor of Dr. Korczak.\'94
  Of course, they were right away excited and before I know, I have a telephone call -- they want to have a radio interview with me.  So with the Canadian radio -- the outfit came too, 
you know -- so then I, I started to talk, you know -- because I have a whole -- I don't have it, my daughter has a whole transcript about my talking about Dr. Korczak experience.  And after that I get a phone call or a letter from New York -- Mr. Levine, 
I think, who was writing books -- he wanted to write something for }{\i\insrsid2580002 Reader's Digest}{\insrsid2580002  about\'85
.  So he paid my trip.  I came over and he had me oral interview also four hours.  And then as I talked -- the more I talked, the more these things came -- to come back and haunt me, because I had to open up and talk and talk and talk and talk.
\par Q: Do you wish that you didn't?
\par A:  No.
\par Q:  \'85rather you wouldn't have\emdash ?
\par A: No, no.  I mean if I wouldn't have those I would take it with me, it would be buried in there, you know?  But our aim -- not only mine -- but our aim is for the world to know, to know -- and especially the young generation -- how, how\'85.  \'93
Be careful, it might happen, don't be so sure of yourself.  Even here, it might happen.\'94  It's to prevent, because such a
 horrible tragedy, you know?  And then you have -- it's the extension of us, our children -- then there's grandchildren.  You saw your parents go, now we start to feel how our parents feel -- like they're, they\rquote re, they\rquote 
re now parents that children were ta
ken from them, they survived and the children didn't.  Now I think it's the worst punishment for a mother or a father to give up a child, you know what I mean?  I mean I wouldn't want to live to see my daughter -- something happen to her.  I'd rather go. 
 So it's okay, it's okay to talk.  It, it, it must be just to do our best we can and leave the rest to Ha-Shem}{\cs33\super\insrsid2580002 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s32\ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0

\par Q: So, do you -- these dreams come to you every night?
\par A: Oh, mostly -- yeah.  It doesn't escape me for a moment because there isn't a day -- unless I sit home, I won't open the TV or anything -- then maybe I can think about something else.  But whatever you do, whoever you see, \'93Oh, how are you?\'94
  So here you are -- I know him from here.  Why do I know him?  Because we were talking about -- or we were there and we met, you know?
\par Q: And it comes to you at night?
\par A: Of course, even we go to functions, like we were, we were -- I was invited -- a lady friend of mine was invited to the Elie Wiesel Bond Drive at the Hilton.  Beautiful event -- you know, beautiful food and all that -- but you sit down at table, \'93
Oh, this one is from Munich, this one is from here.\'94  \'93Oh you're from Munich, but where are you originally from?\'94  Bingo, and the conversation goes 
on.  Then you come home and you take the whole thing with you.  So doesn't escape -- I, I mean, as I said, I cannot sit in a closet.  \'93That's what it is,\'94 I tell to my psychiatrist, \'93
That's what it is, I cannot change it, I cannot erase it, you know?\'94  It makes me shiver, I wake up with cold sweat -- goose pimples, but then I say, \'93Hey look, that's what it is, you know?\'94  I have to accept it.
\par Q: What, what do they, what -- she says that you should be leaving that behind, though?
\par A: She says, \'93Try to, try to be involved in other activities.\'94  I says, \'93Doctor, what activities? I cannot open up my mind.  If I could adopt your accent -- okay, then I could talk about baseball, about football, about American way.\'94
  The minute I open up my mouth, I'm being asked \lquote where are you from?\rquote  because every American has a parent or a grandparent from where I come from -- either from Russia -- either from there -- and here the conversation.  I cannot be -- say, 
\'93I don't want to talk about.\'94  You cannot do to these people -- yo
u cannot put the people down, because right away you're a snob, right?  So you cannot help it, so you're being punished by, by, by the people you're surrounded with and nobody means any harm to you.  And that's what it is and sometimes people want to talk
 about it, and it's good to talk about it -- it kind of, kind of relief, and after I'm finished talking, you know, then I say, \'93Hey, despite of all that, I made it!\'94  What else can I say?
\par Q: Okay.  I think that's what I need to talk to you about.
\par A: Okay.  Are you going to write it out?
\par Q: Yeah, it will be.  I won't, but they will.
\par A: Oh, okay.
\par Q: They'll, they\rquote ll transcribe it all.
\par A: Yeah, so how is it?
\par Q: Oh, great, I mean, it's fine.
\par A: Yeah.  There aren't any happy, happy events that I could talk about.  It's all mostly pain or  -- so, you know.  The most happy event is when -- my daughter's wedding -- when I ordered the first dance with her, and I told them to play \'93
Daddy's Little Girl.\'94  It was nice.  Made her a beautiful wedding and I'm happy about it.
