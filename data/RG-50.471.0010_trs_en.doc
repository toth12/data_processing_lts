tile business, wool textile.  Every summer we use to go 
to the Baltic Sea, a town called Palaga, and spent two 
months of the--of the summer out there.  Uh I had a 
nanny uh and uh--uh we had uh I think a very affluent 
type of existence in Kovno.  My parents had the second

anything in the way of creature comforts and uh we 
lived on uh Litvitz or Laya which was the uh--uh 
main--uh streets through Kovno in those days.  Uh and 
it was a very uh kinda bubbling uh area where all the 
businesses were and uh all the restaurants were and uh 
we use to walk up and down uh the uh streets uh--uh for 
relaxation and to go out to various restaurants and 
stores and so forth.  Uh, use to go to movies a lot and 
uh basically uh very happy existence for me.  Up in 
'till the 1939 when the Russians came in and took over 
and uh in 1941, the Germans came in and started the 
whole Holocaust business.

SB: Tell me those changes in those couple of years.  
Tell me how the things that you remember; the things 
that you heard, saw, how you felt.

JL: Well, it was a big change when the Russian came in.  
Uh, obviously uh they felt that they were liberating 
us.  And I remember something that apparently stuck in 
my mind a train load of watermelon was being shipped in 
from Russia for the hungry Lithuanians.  There was a 
banner on--on the side of the train--uh the cars 
wh--which carried watermelons.  Lithuania was an agri-
cultural country, we never lacked for any food or 
watermelons at that point; for that uh.  
Everybody had to uh fall in step with the Russian 
philosophy of life uh because we were uh business 
people; my parents that is.  Uh, we were classified as 
capitalists.  Our business was confiscated and put into

uh a uh retell and we were not allowed to hold uh any 
jobs.  My father was the designer in the business.  My 
mother was the uh mechanical guroo.  Who use to run all 
the machinery.  She went to Lipestik every year and 
bought the latest machinery and we imported wool from 
France and from England.  And uh when they took our 
machinery away, they didn't know how to maintain it.  
And she was the only one who knew how to do that so 
they gave her a job.  My father couldn't work but my 
mother did.  And we were able to sustain ourselves uh 
okay during that period of time with my mother working.  
My father, in the mean time, cuz he had--couldn't get a 
job or wasn't allowed to work, uh, studied voice and uh 
sang in--in the Opera at least once and subsequently 
when we came to this country became a cantor.  Uh, then 
of course when the Germans moved in, in '41, uh it 
wasn't very long uh--uh that we were told that we had 
to leave our home uh--apartment and only take with us, 
what we could carry.  And we were moved uh mass from uh 
the main part of the town to a suburb and I'm not quite 
sure I remember the actual name of that suburb uh and 
we were put into a ghetto.  Uh, the ghetto was then 
surrounded with barbed wire fences and Lithuanian and 
German guards were standing around watching us uh with 
uh--uh machine guns and towers.  And uh we were forced 
to live in uh this area uh.  The uh--

JL: Uh, well, uh--uh I was all of 9 years old at the 
time.  And all I can remember is that uh--uh shouting 
going on about all the Jews must leave.  Uh and masses 
of people, some wagons, some baby carriages with all 
the goods they could take with them.  Couldn't take any 
furniture or anything like that, uh left behind, so 
they.  We marched in like a long train of people uh 
moving out of the main uh part of the town into the 
suburb.  Uh, basically that's all I can remember when 
he--uh anything that stands in my mind at that particu-
lar transition.

SB: Gunfire, anything like that?

JL: Uh, I don't recall, no.

SB: And what about Pogroms.  What about uh killings or 
humiliation or anti-Semitism?

JL: Well there was plenty of anti-Semitism in Lithuania 
before the Germans came before the Germans came; obvi-
ously before the Russian came for that matter.  Uh, I 
as a child uh was causted almost regularly because I 
looked very Semitic.  And I used to be called all kinds 
of uh names walking don't the street.  And uh we butted 
uh a uh a court yard where we lived where the veterans 
of the Lithuanian army and their families lived and 
they were throwing rocks at us and at one point uh I uh 
was hit by a brick in my head uh from kids on the other

side.  So anti-Semitism was rampant in Lithuania uh 
they didn't need encouragement of Germans to act out 
there anger or frustration or whatever it was uh or 
hatred for the Jews.  During the period I was--uh I can 
recall, I--there were no Pogroms that I was aware at 
least not in Kovno itself.  Perhaps there may 
have been in some of the smaller towns.  But in Kovno I 
don't recall any particular events of this type.

SB: And the moving in to the ghetto, do you remember 
the things your family took or do you remember what you 
took?

DL: I don't remember the details, no, but I--I--uh 
since we could only take what we could carry; essen-
tially clothing, and whether jewelry my parents--my 
mother had uh--uh we took with us and uh--uh that's 
basically all we could carry.  There were four of us; 
my brother, my mother, my father and I and uh there 
wasn't a hell of a lot we could take with us.  Whatever 
we could wrap up in a blanket or something or a sheet 
and carry on our backs.  And so we managed to take 
uh--but the--the--the uh--some of the jewelry that my 
mother had helped save our lives a little bit because 
my mother use to uh sneak out from the barbed wire 
fence through the--at night and barter with the peas-
ants for food and bring food us uh because the food 
rations that we got in the ghetto were very minimal.  
And uh and she was able to bring in substantial amounts 
of foods every time she went across the barbed wire

fence.  Uh so it's the first time, by the way, uh I ate 
pork.  We were Kosher up to that point.  And it was 
uh--uh change.  Uh but uh we were in the ghetto for 3 
years before we were evacuated when the Russian front 
came closer uh and uh I attribute my mothers ability to 
support us with food, beyond the bread and--and the 
marmalade or whatever we got for rations.  Uh, that 
allowed me to survive what came afterwards which was uh 
a one year trek through various concentration camps.

SB: Do you remember the how--the what you moved into?  
Do you remember the room or the...?

JL: Uh, well, we moved in--a couple times during the 
ghetto stay.  We were in what was used to be that time 
was a small ghetto at first.  We live in a house and 
apartment and a house.  Uh we weren't there too long.

SB: Okay you were going to describe to me the first 
place that you live in the ghetto.

JL: Well I said uh we were there for a relatively short 
time.  Uh and then one uh morning uh there's a commo-
tion.  Uh we heard the Germans shouting that we all 
must leave and it came around running up everybody from 
the houses uh and we were taken uh I don't recall 
precisely the route, to a field. I think in afterwards 
we were moved into the uh part of the ghetto which was 
the major part.  Apparently there were two parts be-
cause of the road it ran in between.   And as we henced 
off and uh there was a bridge connecting the two halfs 
or something like that.  And uh they wanted to consoli-
date us in--into one area so we were all made to move.  
There was one building that was a hospital building.  
Quote unquote uh it wasn't a real hospital.  It was 
just a hospital where pe--sick people were kept.  And I 
remember seeing that was on fire.  Uh I thinking in 
terms that uh some of the people that were in that 
hospital were not allowed to leave.  So they might have 
been burned in the building alive.  But that's my 
surmise.  I didn't actually see that other than I saw 
the building burning.  As we walked by uh to go to the 
assembly area and then moved over to the new--uh to--uh 
the major part of the ghetto; main part of the ghetto.  
Uh there was a lot of shooting and--and uh shouting 
going on.  Uh and that's about what I recall at this 
time, uh about that particular event.

SB: Did you walk close to the hospital?

JL: I don't recall but there--there was--there was no 
uh--there was no uh kinda of--I don't really recall the 
detail.  I just remember seeing the building burning.  
And uh--uh the whole thing's a bit hazy so uh those are 
the things that stand out of my mind at this point 
uh.SB: And so you went into the big ghetto and then 
where did you go?

JL: Well, we were forced into a house where uh there 
were like uh three rooms in the house and the main area 
on the second floor of the building and there were 
three families living in the house.  Uh my brother, 
mother, uh my father and myself and there aren't maybe 
a total of like uh maybe 15 people in that uh one floor 
or apartment that we were in.  And I believe we stayed 
their throughout the remainder of the ghetto, uh peri-
od.  Uh (pause) it was uh no particular uh situation 
that I can recall uh while we were there except that uh 
eh--I should not--not--uh--uh put it that way.  Um, uh 
while we were in that apartment, I remember there was 
some kinda of uh commotion going on and the German 
soldiers came around and asked for jewelry and gold and

uh my brother uh had an old broken down watch in his 
pocket and he forgot about it and then didn't hand it 
over and the German looked and found it, he was going 
to shoot him, right there and then in the spot.  Uh--uh 
and my brother said to him that it's an old broken 
watch, it doesn't work, you know, it's worthless.  Uh 
he talked him out of shooting him and took the broken 
down watch and left but uh there was uh--uh quite a 
commotion.  It was one of the first big commotions that 
uh in the main ghetto.  As I recall, when they went 
from house to house looking for uh jewelry, gold and 
valuables.

SB: Did you mother keep some hidden then?

JL: Yes.

SB: Did you know where it went?

JL: No, no.  I don't recall where.  But uh obviously 
she had some--it wasn't just jewelry she was trading 
with the peasants uh the farmers.  Uh it was clothing 
and uh--whether it was small piece of fur she was able 
to bring in from uh the home that we have.

SB: Tell me about the--there was a time when everyone 
had to assemble from the ghetto.  Do you remember that?  
It was pretty early...in October--it was the end of 
October, in 1941.  Do you remember that?

JL: Uh, not by date.  But there were several assemblies 
that we had to attend to.  Uh, there was one area which 
was a main square like where the gate from the ghetto 
uh was uh.  And people use to have to assemble there to 
go into work brigades.  My brother, my father being one 
of them.  They uh assembled in the morning.  They were 
marched out and uh--uh we were standing at night--in 
evening rather waiting for him to come back and hoping 
that they would come back and in some cases they some 
of them did not.  Uh there were assemblies for work 
details as far as I can remember--remember.  Uh there 
may have been assemblies for other reasons and but uh I 
my family and I were not impacted by that since we all 
managed to get back to our apartment, at the time.  
There were other assemblies subsequently.  Uh we use to 
call it the Big Action or the Big Actia where we were 
woken up early in the morning and marched to a big 
field and uh people were being selected; uh the 
typ--typical left and right uh kind of situation.  Uh 
but that came later.  Uh, my father and my mother and 
my brother and I uh we were work--worked as family 
unit.  If you were a uh--a uh woman only without the 
man--uh without a husband or someone uh you were vul-
nerable because they would select you to what was 
perceived at the time to be the wrong side.  Uh so as 
we walking towards the field where this action took 
place, uh my brother who's eight years older than I, 
and he's uh robust young man and a woman came by with a 
child and she grabbed his arm and latched on to him and 
just to be part of the family unit.  Uh, and another

one came in, grabbed me and I was only like about what 
about 11 years old?  12 about I think.  Uh, fortunately 
for us because what my brother and my father who were 
young and robust people uh were redeemed to be of 
work--of labor quality and so the whole family unit 
including the two strange women, heh, that latched on 
to us uh managed to be selected into the side that 
survived.  The other side were apparently taken to 
uh--uh what I understand is to be a Fort in where they 
were shot.  At least that's the story that I--I recall.  
Uh so that was uh very trying time for us and a very 
dramatic experience.  Uh, there was another time when 
we had an assembly uh were all of us were forced to 
gather around a big place and there was a uh a scaf-
fold, a hanging scaffold and there was a man being 
brought out and we were forced to watched uh to the 
scaffold.  And the reason presumably that he was going 
to be executed, hanged.  That they uh was that they 
found some kind of a weapon on him.  And uh I remember 
uh being made to watch this uh where they put him up on 
a box I believe with his hands and legs tied, I think.  
Uh and they kicked out the box from under him.  A 
German soldier did that and he was hanging.  The things 
you remember as a child is that uh--uh urine was coming 
down his leg as he was wriggling on--on--on the 
noose--on the rope.  Uh, so uh that's another one of 
those uh assemblies that we were made to go to.

SB: Okay, I think we're about to run out.  Why don't we 
change.(Cut)

was relative routine.  Um, can you describe to me what 
life was like in those periods?  Do you remember having 
any schooling?  Do you remember playing games with your 
friends?  Sports?  Getting into trouble?

JL: Well, uh I remember that uh we were as children, 
hanging around a little bit in the streets.  Uh, I 
remember that uh there was a cobbler who use to make uh 
boots and uh the German officers to come to uh have 
boots custom made for them and the uh we watched that 
and uh it was uh an impression that made uh me, was 
that even in the ghetto, if you had any kind of skill 
or craft, uh you could survive better than anybody 
else.  So that gave me the philosophy in life that uh 
what I have in my brain, and my skills and my abili-
ties, nobody can take away, while all material things 
can be taken away.  Obviously the cobbler is getting 
additional rations of food and for--for services for 
making boots.  Uh, I for a short while there, before we 
moved, uh from another house, uh had a garden that I 
grew vegetables in the spring and never made it uh to

uh--uh reap they were wards of my labor because we were 
forced to leave the place but I had potatoes and other 
vegetables that I don't know where I got the seeds 
or--or--or--or I got the uh all that and planted them.  
My father worked in a work shop and because his grand-
father--my grandfather's father use to be a wood carv-
er--he knew how to carve uh shoes--wooden shoes.  Cuz 
there's of course wasn't any leather--any cows weren't 
available.  So the--the wooden soles, you know, were 
carved to uh--to fit my particular uh size and shape of 
a foot.  And he was very good at it.  I had no--there 
was no schooling at the time, however since I had not 
had any uh training in--in--in the Torah, the Bible, 
there was a Rabbi who had no skills in that he could 
apply, my father's taught him how to carve the sh--the 
shoes in return for which he taught me the Bible.  So I 
uh spent uh--that was the extent of my schooling during 
the ghetto period for a period of some months where I 
uh got lessons on--on--on the Bible.  That was my 
upbringing in Religion if you will, uh from the age of 
about uh 10/11 years old uh thereabouts 12 years old.  
Uh, I worked in the bakery and the uh bakery was obvi-
ously was baking bread for--for the ghetto residents.  
And on weekends on Chapeaus Day, women use to bring the 
pots with uh stew, potatoes and whatever else they 
could find and uh stick it in the hot oven uh so that 
uh on--on Chapeaus, they could have a hot meal and 
since I was in the bakery handling all that every so

father was able-bodied.  My brother was able-bodied.  
My mother--they were all able to work and or gather 
enough food and whatever else we needed which was not a 
hell of a lot just to get by.

people that you lived with?

JL: Uh well, uh I recall specifically the apartment I 
mentioned I mentioned earlier where there were like uh 
whole bunch of us--three families in it.  And it was a 
little bit touch and go there.  The nerves were kinda 
frayed and people were screaming at each other but uh, 
I personally don't recall any major outbreaks of uh any 
fighting or violence that went on.  Uh, other than the 
inconvenience of everybody being on top of everybody.

because I don't recall exactly what she was 
doing during the time.  So obviously she had to get 
into some kind of work uh unit but I don't recall 
exactly at what she was doing.  Remember my father was 
working in the workshop.  My brother was working in the 
workshop.  I don't know exactly what my mother was 
doing at the time.

bunch of kids.  My mother came around screaming.  She 
grabbed me by the arm and ran as quickly as we could.  
And she got me into the workshop where my father and my 
brother were working.  I didn't know at the time what 
it was all about and uh other than there's some kind of 
uh--um drastic or--or--or life threatening event taking 
place.  Uh, and I worked alongside my father and my 
brother in the workshop during that day.  And there was

afterwards when it was apparently all over, and my 
mother came to fetch me, I found out that the children 
rounded up throughout the ghetto and taken away and for 
some reason or other they did not bother to go into the 
workshop; perhaps thinking that there wouldn't be any 
children inside.  But that the workshop was not at all 
effected by the particular Action.  (Cough)

JL: Well a lot of screaming going on and Germans shout-
ing.  Uh, mothers, I guess, screaming, trying to hide 
or protect their children.  Uh but we all ran in all 
directions and uh those of us who were lucky enough 
or--were--had the wits about them, like my mother did.  
She got me into the workshop and I was untouched.  I 
don't think others faired as well even if they were 
hidden because from what I understand, the Germans came 
around looking through the houses and dragging out all 
the children that they could find.

SB: Do you remember that night and the next day?  Do 
you remember sounds?--things that you heard that were 
sounds.

JL: No, no that's not vivid in my mind.  I was rath--

SB: How did you feel?  Were you terrified?

JL: I was scared, yes of course.  I didn't know what 
was going on and my mother literally dragged me into 
the workshop.  She ran as fast as you know I could 
barely keep up with her.  Uh so the fear was there, 
very much so and tried to stay out of sight as much as 
I could in the workshop and--and--you know try and keep 
up with whatever work they gave me.  So my 
brother and my father handed me some things, some tools 
to do.  And I looked like I was belonged there.  But I 
don't remember uh any of the specific details as we 
were running, the surrounding shouting and screaming 
and running of people, sort of like uh ca--coming past 
me.  Uh without my having an opportunity to focus on 
anything because we were just looking to where we we're 
running to.  Uh it was panic but that's basically uh 
all I can recall of that particular event.

Action.  Were you aware of much of--were you aware of 
how different it was?  Can you describe that to me?

JL: I'm not quite sure uh to me it was a sequence of 
blurry scenes that went one place to the next to the 
next.  Uh--

SB: There were fewer people at the end?JL: Really, 
there were several Actions that took place and people 
were taken off and shot at the uh I forget the number 
of the Fort it was supposed to have been.  So there 
were clearly fewer people yes.  But things seemed to 
have moved along where people mustering every morning 
to go out to work brigades and coming back at night or 
working at the workshop where my father uh subsequent-
ly--my brother subsequently worked.  Uh, as far as I 
remember, that was the uh a uh ongoing routine, if you 
will.  Until one day uh we're made aware that we're 
gonna be evacuated and then move to place all over 
again.  Uh, we didn't know where we were going to go.  
We didn't know where we were being taken.  Apparently 
the adults had heard something.  As a child I don't 
recall what uh having about the extermination camps of 
uh that we subsequently learned about.  But uh a bunch 
of us--us, me and my parents and my brother as bystand-
ers sort of, made arrangements to prevent being evacu-
ated by hiding out in a sub-basement if you will of one 
of the large buildings that was there.  Like a concrete 
building of some sort.  Uh, where they dug up the dirt 
under the floor and uh when it became clear that uh

people were being rounded up to be evacuated.  My 
mother, my father and myself wound up in that basement, 
if you will.  The basement had a trap door through 
which you--we came in, uh under a floor in the build-
ing.  And had an exit door that was covered in dirt 
from the outside so it couldn't be seen.  And we were, 
a bunch of us, families, children, whatever few chil-
dren were there wound up in that uh--uh bunker, if you 
will--whatever you want to call it.  Uh, that was a 
very--not only frightening but very difficult environ-
ment to be in.  We were there for days.  How many, I 
don't recall.  There's no uh air.  It was very hot.  It 
was in the summer I believed.  We stripped our clothing 
off, intentionally to be able to stay there.   And the 
air was foul and uh there was no toilet facilities.  
Uh, it became very very difficult to just exist in that 
environment.  We heard commotions outside; Germans 
running around shouting the Uden Roust, you know.  
Worstatefect and Verchaust and uh there were some 
children who were crying in--in the basement uh, I 
guess the mothers or fathers tried to shut them up so 
that they wouldn't be heard but apparently somebody did 
hear commotion or suspected one, found a trap door and 
dropped a grenade down.  Uh, at that point everybody 
started screaming and uh shouting that, you know, don't 
shoot we're gonna come out or words to that effect.  
Uh, so we were all taking out from that hole in the 
ground, under the sub-floor of the building and uh I 
still remember, you know, I had barely any clothing on.  
Uh and we were marched off to eventually a railroad

siting where there's some cattle cars and we're all 
loaded up in the cattle cars.  My father, my mother and 
I--my brother was still running around somewhere in the 
ghetto and we didn't know where he was and my mother 
was very worried but uh just before the train was about 
to--those who were about to be shot on the cattle cars, 
my brother showed up an jumped on--on the train.  He 
was a quite, you know, a young robust guy.  He was able 
to maneuver quite well.  And he got joined us in 
the--in the train.

SB: Was the ghetto burning when you came out?

JL: Uh frankly, I don't recall.  So that it does not 
seem to have made an impression of me if it was because 
at that time we were just worried we were going to be 
shot any where from the time they got us out of the 
bunker to the time they go us to the railroad siting.  
It wasn't until we were essentially loaded in the 
trains that uh, you know, we felt uh somewhat safe.  At 
least, temporarily.  And everybody was looking forward 
and not looking to the sides, not to make any eye-
contact with the Germans or anything like that.  So uh 
I don't recall my surroundings other than I was very 
miserable, uncomfortable and uh half naked and uh going 
into uh marched--be marched to the railroad siting.

SB: And the grenade?  Had it gone off?

How many people were in it?

JL: From what I recall it was almost elbow to elbow 
full of people.  Everybody who could and who knew about 
it and people who worked in the workshop knew about it, 
wanted to hide out and they ran in and there's no way 
to keep them out.  Uh so it--it was very very tight.  
Uh I remember my family unit of claiming a little 
corner in that uh basement and uh we sort of stuck 
together uh close b--because there was no really room 
to move around.  It was almost like  everywhere you 
took a step, there's a body there.  The people there 
with there families.  As I said there was no toilet 
facilities in that hole.  And that there was one corner 
where everybody relieved themselves--if they could find 
it and get to it in time.

SB: It was a very big hiding place.

JL: Yes it was a very large room--uh something in the 
order of this room here uh in size.  Uh it was uh 
quite--quite a big--well it was prepared--it was dug up 
uh to make it uh house many people as possible that 
were on the in group of that workshop--that knew what 
was going on and what was being worked on.  So they

SB: How could you stand up?

JL: Just in your place where you--where you were.

SB: Just sort of like a cattle car?

JL: Just like a cattle car, exactly.

SB: Was there light?

JL: No.  We didn't want to put lights on a case.  That 
would spot it.  Uh, we tried to stay as quiet as possi-
ble but I imagine there was at least one child there 
who was crying and eventually uh wound up having uh 
detected.  Uh so, it was--it never intended to be of 
such a long term stay.  We thought the Germans would 
come, take everybody out and in a day or two they would 
be gone and we would be freed.  But it was we stayed 
over much longer than anybody had anticipated and that 
was not prepared for that kind of a long stay.

there's gonna be an evacuation.  The Russian army was 
getting close and the Germans were going to evacuate 
all of us out of Lithuania.  So in preparation for it, 
dug this sub-basement uh--uh and the entrance to it was 
through a trap door in the building.  It was hidden.  
And uh there was one other--a door in the uh basement, 
in the side of the room but it was covered on the 
outside by dirt so that it would not be detected as a 
door.  And uh when things became more imminent or

large number of people at that.  My father, my mother 
and I--and my brother was not with us at the time uh I 
don't know where he was but he was somewhere in the 
ghetto roaming around on his own.  Uh we were in that 
room for a number of days uh perhaps a week or longer.  
It was extremely hot uh and uh foul air.  There was no 
toilet facilities in there.  People use to have to 
relieve themselves went to one corner and relieve 
themselves there and uh cover it up I guess the with 
the--the dirt in the basement uh.  Uh it got so hot 
that everybody took their clothes off, just about.  And 
we were uh half naked in there.  It was uh dark uh I 
guess the primary reason was because we didn't want to 
be detected some how by a crack of light coming out at 
night so the Germans could spot us.  Uh and we sat 
there for uh days I said.  Uh shouting going on all 
around.  Uh the Germans uh shouting at uh all the Jews, 
all the Udenroust.  Uh and uh we heard shots outside 
and uh--uh we stayed there until--you know the baby but 
it starts crying and the parent tried to shut the baby 
up but apparently uh a German cause whoever heard it, 
and they found the trap door and dropped a grenade and 
uh when the grenade exploded it injured one of the 
people who stood nearest the trapdoor.  Everyone start-
ed shouting and of course we were discovered.  And uh 
we opened up the side door and started coming out.  We 
were--were was it semi-dressed or uh.  Uh and uh we're 
rounded up--lined up and--and marched off from that uh

all loaded up in cattle cars.  Uh, my brother--my 
brother was still not there but uh my father, my mother 
and I were in one of the cattle cars and uh--and my 
brother showed up and ran from cattle car to cattle car 
looking for us and when he found us, he hopped on and 
we were all on the cattle car being take out of Lithua-
nia.  Uh that was basically one of the uh scariest 
times, if you will, for me personally.  Uh, although 
I've been scared before in the actions that we spoke 
about earlier.  Uh, this was very frightening especial-
ly when the grenade went off and we thought we were all 
going to be shot.  Uh, that's basically all I can 
remember of--of--of that particular event.  But it was 
uh perhaps the most dramatic event for me, at the time, 
as a child.

SB: And do you think you could talk a bit about what 
you're--how you mother worked to save the family?

JL: Yes, my mother uh--uh was pretty much uh the brain 
in--in--in the business and in the family.  She was not 
Semitic looking.  Uh light haired and uh spoke uh 
Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, German, and uh she was 
able to sustain us uh by sneaking out of the barbed 
wire fence in the middle of the night and visiting 
farmers in this outskirts of the ghetto.  (Cough) And 
uh bartering and trading clothing and or pieced of 
jewelry for food.  Nobody had butter for example.  Uh 
we had butter cuz she was able to get it from uh the 
peasants, the farmers.  Uh, uh nobody--I shouldn't say

nobody but uh we wound up having uh pork, for example 
uh cause there was hardly any meat in the uh ghetto and 
from the rations that I recall.  We were getting bread 
and maybe some margarine and maybe some marmalade or 
something and some potatoes.  Uh, so uh she was uh--she 
did uh--quite often at the risk of her life and managed 
to come back every morning with a bundle of food for 
us.  Uh she was uh--uh obviously awaring--alert to us 
what was going on and able to uh win over quite well 
under the circumstances.  Uh and I believe that uh from 
a physical stand point and health stand point uh she 
was responsible for us being in reasonably good shape.  
At the end of the ghetto period, when we were taken to 
concentration camps, subsequently, still survive the 
concentration camps.  Many people uh didn't quite make 
it because of poor nutrition, poor food and health 
reasons in the because the way we were able to sustain 
ourselves, I think we made it to uh--uh perhaps we had 
a little bit uh--uh my father, mother, my--my brother 
and I all survived uh the Holocaust and were liberated 
in Austria and Germany.  So that uh I believe that she 
was the main contributor to our well being.

SB: She sent you uh packing with cotton in your boots 
or something?

JL: Yes.  She uh--I was small stature.  As a kid, I was 
not very large and I'm only 5'5" now.  Or I was 5'5" a 
few years ago.  Uh, so uh she felt if I looked bigger 
and taller that I would uh do a little bit better.  So

I had boots, ankle boots and she made me put cotton in 
the boots--in the heels to raise me by a couple inches.  
And I wore those boots throughout the concentration 
camp and I believe that eh at least in one of the 
concentration camp help me survive.SB: And you were on 
uh--riding down the road on trucks to the boats when 
you reunited with your brother.

JL: After liberation in Austria, there were--there were 
a hundred and fifty Lithuanian kids who wound up uh 
from the Kovno ghetto uh in--in Lansbury which is near 
Dakaw and taken from Dakaw to Auschwitz and subsequent-
ly--matter of fact there are about 50 of us survived 
out of the hundred and fifty.  Uh most of us found 
ourselves in the uh--uh town called Welles, Austria.  
And we were rounded up by the U.S. authorities and uh 
put into a barracks--it use to be a German barracks.  
And a couple months later the Haganah showed up and I 
says, 'We want to go to Lithuania,' or Palestine at the 
time .  And of course we had no knowledge of any family 
relationship or existence or anything.  We were all on 
our own, uh we were--we said fine, you know, let's go.  
So they pull some trucks, in the kind of a maybe six or 
eight military trucks with the tarp over the top but 
the front of the tarp was open and I was standing at 
the head right over the driver's uh cabin.  And uh the 
convoy had stopped on a highway in Austria.  I believe 
there was a problem with a woman who had fainted or 
something.  Uh, so the whole convoy came to a halt and 
as I was standing there uh looking down the road,

(Crying) I saw my--I saw my brother coming and I spot-

that either he or--or my father or anybody survived so 
that uh he took me off the truck and took me back to 
where my father was which was Munich at the time.  Uh, 
the rest of the convoy went on to the uh ships like the 
Haganah.  Now the uh the edge of the ship--the famous 
story uh to uh immigrate legally into a Palestine.  
That's why I wound up in Munich and eventually the 
United States, instead of winding up in Israel.  Uh, my 
mother is still not know of at the time and uh we lived 
in--in the Falofin DP camp for a while and then we had 
an apartment in Munich, afterwards.  About a year or so 
later, a knock on the door and I open up the door and 
there was my mother.  (Crying) So anyway all were
