\par NL:\tab Dr. Samson, I want to again thank you very much for coming this long distance 
from Princeton in order to make your story part of our Oral History Archive.  Let's start, if we may, by asking if you could tell us a little about your beginnings, your background, place of birth, something about your family, where you were born.
\par SS:\tab Okay
.  Let's begin with my name.  I am named Sonja.  I am named after my maternal grandmother, who died before I was born, and in the Jewish tradition, a child should be named after the deceased closest kin.  Her name was Susanna, and my mother did not like t
h
at name at all.  Now, how do we get to the name Sonja?  My grandparents, on both sides, Samson, and my mother's maiden name, Hoffman, all were born and raised in a town in the northeastern part of Germany close to the ocean and adjacent to the Dutch borde
r
.  The name of the town is Aurich, A-U-R-I-C-H.  I met a cousin in the early 50's, the only time I went to Israel, whose name was, like my father's, Joseph Samson, and he said he had traced the family genealogy to the Samsons having originated in Italy, a
n
d moved northward in the 16th Century.  And part of the family ended up in Holland, part of the family in Germany.  This cousin, Joseph Samson, who would be a man my father's age, they were first cousins, his branch of the family ended up in Holland, and 
m
y family in Germany.  My maternal grandfather, Aaron Hoffman, was also called Adolf Hoffman, went into an apprenticeship, as was common in those days, to learn to be a salesman.  You know that they apprenticed for years.  So, during the course of his appr
e
nticeship, he met his wife, my grandmother, maternal.  Her name was Hilda Loew, L-O-E-W.  She came from a southern part of Germany.  They married and they established themselves in the Saar, which is adjacent to France, the French border.  They were very 
s
uccessful, both of them starting from zero, and took advantage, I guess, of the fact that this was coal mines, that's what the Saar was about, and ended up with a substantial department store, probably one of the largest in the region, in a town named Dil
lingen, the capital of Saar is Saarbr\'fccken, and Dillingen is not far from there.  They did so well that by American dollars, by American standards--and I can go back into documenting how I know this to be a fact--but apparently they were millionaires.

\par NL:\tab First generation...
\par SS:\tab First generation.  Right.  Accordingly, my mother, Carla Hoffman, was born in Dillingen, and so was her brother, who was three years older than her.  His name was Ludwig, or Louis.  Now, since the rest of the family, that is my mater
nal grandfather, Aaron Hoffman, came from Aurich, he had some five or six siblings who were all in Aurich.  Thus, there was a lot of traveling up and back between Aurich and Dillingen.  Thus, I assume that my mother knew my father from childhood on.  My f
ather's family, the Samsons, were quite wealthy, quite well-to-do in a profession that is not thought of commonly as being a Jewish profession, but they were cattle-raisers.  They raised cattle and sold cattle--}{\i\fs24 Viehh\'e4ndler}{\fs24 
.  Do you speak German?
\par NL:\tab I read it.  I read it.  I understand some of it.
\par SS:\tab So the Samsons, also, I think they are my paternal grandfather, Rubin Samson, has something like five brothers, all raised in Aurich.  When my mother married my father in 1929, I think--I was born in 1931, they settled in Aurich.
\par NL:\tab And you were born there?
\par SS:\tab And I was born in Aurich.  Now back to the name--I lost it!  So, I was to be named Susanna after my father's mother who had died.  My mother did not like the name. 1931, the 30's, was the height of the f
lourishing of Communism, especially in the Saar, among miners...
\par NL:\tab Interesting.
\par SS:\tab ...and my mother, being a rebellious lady, chose the name Sonja, which was a popular...
\par NL:\tab But despite her upper middle class...
\par SS:\tab Right!  Right!
\par NL:\tab ...rank, she had sympathy for the workers, the proletariat...?
\par SS:\tab Right, right.  And neither parents, my father nor my mother, ever called me Sonja, except when somebody was angry, then it was "Zonyal".
\par NL:\tab What did they call you?
\par SS:\tab Sonie.  Sonie.
\par NL:\tab Sonie.  Ah, that's nice.
\par SS:\tab So that was the only name that I really responded to. Sonja was always...
\par NL:\tab When you were being scolded?
\par SS:\tab Right, right.
\par NL:\tab And what was their life like in the 30's?  Was there a lot of labor discontent?
\par SS:\tab Well, I wouldn't know.  My, uh
\par NL:\tab From what you heard?
\par SS:\tab Let's go back to Dillingen then.  My mother and her brother were said to be raised as spoiled brats.  He was said to have been a playboy, and the reason that that has been for me personally, problematic, is that, on the one hand
, no one close in family survived.  I'm really the only survivor, with the exception of one cousin, first cousin, Samson, and his sister, who have followed the pattern.  And that is, the pattern has been, any time I ever wanted to talk to any distant rela
t
ive in the United States, or this first cousin, whatever they have to say is totally colored by still ongoing envy, resentment and jealousy.  It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable.  So that it's always been relatives of my parents' generation, that is, the
i
r first cousins, you know, the other side, and whatever, and there's still, "Oh, we remember Aurich and the parties" and all that.  But in fact, I promptly gave up asking them anything because, well, at the time, it was disturbing.  As I look upon it now,
 
I'm keenly aware of the fact that their profound jealousy, resentment, in spite of the fact that these people, my parents, they were in camps, they were slaughtered in Aurich, I mean in Auschwitz, and all the rest.  None of that seems to have erased the i
ntensity of their envy.
\par NL:\tab Incredible.
\par SS:\tab Yeah!  This includes, by the way, my cousin Henry Samson, who is my first cousin, as I said.  He survived in Belgium, with his sister.  When I first moved to New Jersey, I 
contacted him, and all I got was in fact, in these photo albums there are photos of his sister, him and I as children, and the amazing thing about the photos--I look happy in the pictures, but they look surly.  And he starts out with, "Oh, I remember when
 we went to visit you at your house in Aurich, how it was a big deal for all of us, you know, going to see Sonja and her family, and it was so wealthy, so opulent."  And they just--in fact, they themselves, were quite well off.
\par NL:\tab But you were a notch higher?
\par SS:\tab I'm sorry?
\par NL:\tab You were a notch higher?
\par SS:\tab Oh, G-d knows, I was an only child and all that.
\par NL:\tab But, I mean, the image of this wealth...
\par SS:\tab Yes, yes.  So, I decided, the hell with all these people.  At some level, there had been some fantasy on my part about this cousin who lived in Edison, New Jersey, that it would be nice...
\par NL:\tab Of course.
\par SS:\tab But I'm not willing go put up with that kind of...
\par NL:\tab Break down all of those old...
\par SS:\tab Yeah, and to hell with it, to hell with it.
\par NL:\tab Do you have any memories of your life in Aurich as a child, so up to six...
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I do.  I do.  More than that, I think for a terribly long time, I had an incredibly reliable, clear, uncluttered memory for events, which I've lost.  And part of the reason, I think, was
 that I had made a very deliberate and conscious attempt to remember dates, places and so on, because until 1946 or '47, I always thought I would see my parents again, and it was important for me to fill in for them everything that had happened to me, whe
re I had been, and what I had done.  So my memory is sketchy, but, nonetheless, I think at some level, it's relatively sharp.  About my mother, I remember vividly her stories of World War I.  I don't know if you want to go into that.
\par NL:\tab Yes.  If you don't mind.
\par SS:\tab Not at all.
\par NL:\tab She told these to you when you were a young child?
\par SS:\tab Yes, yes.
\par NL:\tab She suffered much?
\par SS:\tab No. My mother, I think, in part, one of the reasons for the family's intense dislike of her, I mean, that they couldn't overcome it, aside
 from the kind of, you know, sociological perspective, one notch higher.  I think, in fact, she was a very interesting lady.  She was an exceptional woman in the sense that, well, she went to school in Lausanne, so she spoke French fluently.  It's been pu
t
 down as having been a finishing school, but you know, a school by any other name was a school.  She once broke her arm during World War I, she remembers that--remembered that--and was in a rehabilitation center in which they, because the arm was stiff, t
h
ey put it in some kind of machinery, you know, that bent the arm backwards and forwards.  And there were all these miners with their injuries, and she said that she cut the fan belt that activated the machine, and the whole thing stopped, and everybody wa
s
 delighted.  Now, whether that in fact was true or not--how the hell do I know?  But, it says something about what kind of person she was, or pictured herself.  She told stories about how they used to play war, how buildings would come tumbling down.  She
 remembered, she said, being gassed, you know, gas was being used, and said in case that ever happens, just urinate in your underwear and hold it in front of your nose--and breathe through it!
\par NL:\tab Did it work?
\par SS:\tab Apparently, apparently!  But I've never forgotten that, you know?
\par NL:\tab Quite a trick!  Amazing.  Probably an old wives' tale that worked.
\par SS:\tab Possibly.  There seems to be some notion that maybe it does.  Anyway, she fought, as I do, the perennial battle of the bulge, that is gaining excessive amount
s of weight, and dieting, and that is also quite apparent in the photos.  You know, expansion and contraction.  And I seem to have the identical problem.  My father was an exceedingly handsome man.  Again, the photos show that.  A very bright man, a very 
brave man, and a man of character, and his motto was, "}{\i\fs24 Un homme sa parole}{\fs24 ", which means, A man, his word.  And, that's how he died.
\par NL:\tab You heard that?  You heard that phrase?
\par SS:\tab Yes, yes.  And he lived that, and he died that.
\par NL:\tab You had a happy childhood, I take it.
\par SS:\tab Extremely.
\par NL:\tab Although you were alone, you had playmates, of course.
\par SS:\tab No, but you know, that's an American }{\i\fs24 meshugas}{\fs24 , when you need playmates.
\par NL:\tab Oh, sorry.
\par SS:\tab Or when you need toys, or anything like that.
\par NL:\tab How did you amuse yourself?
\par SS:\tab You want to go back to Aurich...
\par NL:\tab Just a bit.
\par SS:\tab And I, sometimes, you know, the stories that one recalls best about oneself, have a way, just like my mother's story, of saying something about the person, and I think at
 some level, I haven't changed, or there's a part of me that's still that.  In Aurich, where we had a house--it was a big house--because I did go there after the war.  It was then occupied, by, I don't know, five or six families lived in that house.

\par NL:\tab Huge.
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  And, you know, we had maids, and in Dillingen, I remember the chauffeur and his children, and the neighbors, and so on.  But anyway, we lived--the house in Aurich was }{\i\fs24 am Hafen}{\fs24 
, which means, I can't think of the word.  It was on the riverbank.
\par NL:\tab }{\i\fs24 Am Hafen}{\fs24 ...
\par SS:\tab }{\i\fs24 Am}{\fs24 --by }{\i\fs24 Hafen}{\fs24 
 means port, or bank, riverbank.  And I remember one of my earliest memories was when I was about four years old.  We left Aurich, I think, in 1936 or '37.  I left in '36, so I was five years old, and joined my grandparent
s when I moved to Luxembourg.  I lived with them for one year.  My parents moved to northern France.  But anyway, so whatever recall I have of Aurich has to be before the age of five.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab One story: This river which was in front of the house--well
, there was the house, a road and the river, and that river always had logs transported, whatever, and that was forbidden.  You couldn't go down, step down onto the river on the logs.  Well, I did.
\par NL:\tab You did.
\par SS:\tab With the neighbor boys, and I fell in and
 I got soaking wet and I went home, and when I got home, I was first greeted by the maid, who asked me what had I done, and it was clear.  She spanked me and put me to bed.  My mother came home and asked, "Where's Sonie?" and the maid told her.  My mother
 came upstairs, spanked me, and said, "Don't do that again." And when my father came home, late in the evening, he did the same story.  So that was the only time I could remember three spankings.
\par NL:\tab Three spankings  How did you amuse yourself?  Do you remember if you looked at picture books?
\par SS:\tab I re--well, in part, there are lots of photos, you know, sometimes it happens that when you look at photos, they cloud one's memory, and it becomes fixed to a photo in part.
\par NL:\tab I see what you mean.
\par SS:\tab So there is 
the, you know, a sandbox, and stuff like that.  I remember my mother, I think, loved to travel.  She was a rather cosmopolitan lady and Aurich was kind of a dull dump and a hole, and so I recall frequently being on trains with her, visiting up and back.  
In fact, at times when I had the urge, or thought I should write a kind of autobiography, I was going to call it "Trains."  There's so much good and bad, horrible and soothing in my life...
\par NL:\tab In Germany, mostly?  Or across the borders?
\par SS:\tab Both.  The across-the-border story with my mother was--and that I have a pictorial recall.  We were crossing the border, my mother had smuggled something.
\par NL:\tab This was already by '36, '37?
\par SS:\tab No, no, this was also still before, after...
\par NL:\tab You getting tired?  You want to stop?
\par SS:\tab No, no, no, no.  Whatever she smuggled, I don't remember--whether it was French liqueur or French--God knows what, but at the appropriate time when the inspector came, I recall lying on the bank, on a, you know, th
e thing you lie down on in the train.  It's interesting when I think back, German, French and English sort of--English is not the language that...
\par NL:\tab That you remember.
\par SS:\tab That I remember it in.
\par NL:\tab You don't remember it in--you think of it in French or German.
\par SS:\tab Well, as a friend once pointed out to me, in German I tell the truth, in French...
\par NL:\tab You elaborate?
\par SS:\tab No.  In French, I lie, and in English, I intellectualize.
\par NL:\tab Oh my, that' a quite profound statement.
\par SS:\tab It is, because when I try--there are times that I sort of get external and out of touch, and if I want to get a sense of what am I really feeling, I try to think in German.
\par NL:\tab Still that powerful pulse of the language?
\par SS:\tab Right.  But it's like layers, you know, like an onion.  So anyw
ay, on that train, I remember being awakened by the customs inspectors, as is--was customary--whenever you crossed the border, and just as he was looking through the luggage, I just vomited all over the place, and he ran off.  This was one of my mother's 
favorite stories about me!
\par NL:\tab Oh, my, that's marvelous.
\par SS:\tab The other early story was in Dillingen, in my grandparents' department store--no, it wasn't in the store.  I don't know, we were someplace, somewhere, in some town, some city.  We were in a fancy 
restaurant, and the story that my mother told, and that a cousin who currently lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, confirmed, was that as I came back to the dinner table, I yelled with my most exuberant self, "}{\i\fs24 
Mutti, Mutti, ich habe einen grossen Haufen geschissen}{\fs24 ." Which means, "Mother, Mother, I shit a pile!" [laughter]
\par NL:\tab That's a marvelous story!
\par SS:\tab So you want to know about playmates and stuff like that...
\par NL:\tab Well, that's the American bias.  I guess...
\par SS:\tab Well, it is an obnoxious kind of a bias, because we instilled in the kids that happiness is other kids to play with.  And, you know, I didn't and...
\par NL:\tab You were happy...
\par SS: \tab ...and that wasn't part of my world, and when I was with kids, mostly it involved being in mischief, mostly for the reason of 
not being visible as a Jew.  If there was something nasty to be done, which--it was a good cover up, and I was very deliberate and very conscious about doing that.
\par NL:\tab Then...
\par SS:\tab I can tell a lot of stories about that.
\par NL:\tab Was there, then, a sense that you were not wanted there as Jews?
\par SS:\tab No. I'm referring mostly later.
\par NL:\tab Oh, later.  But how about during this period up to the time that you moved away to Luxembourg?  Were your parents involved in the so-called Jewish community at all?  Did they go to }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 ?
\par SS:\tab Well, you know, all the stuff that's been written about German Jews being so assimilated and all that, my family on both sides were very interesting.  On the one hand, they were utterly assimilated.  My father was a very successful businessman, g
ot along extremely well with his customers, the peasants.  They trusted him, both in Germany and in France, where he really worked for a very short period of time.  They trusted him.  He was sort of like his own veterinarian.  He never needed the recourse
 of a veterinarian, and at the same time, they were Orthodox Jews.
\par NL:\tab Is that so?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes.
\par NL:\tab How many Jews do you suppose were in Aurich?  A handful?  Several hundred?
\par SS:\tab It was a substantial Jewish community.  It had a substantial }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 , and just about in Milwaukee, in Chicago, in various places, there are a lot of Aurich Jews, and they flock together.
\par NL:\tab Is that so?
\par SS:\tab In fact, both in Chicago and in Milwaukee, two cousins who were brothers, Hoffmans, established their own synagogue to recreate...
\par NL:\tab The German.
\par SS:\tab The German...
\par NL:\tab ...model.
\par SS:\tab Right.  So, I'm terrible about estimating numbers, but I would say a number of sufficient to found their own synagogue.
\par NL:\tab And did you go to }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24  with your parents?  Do you remember going?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.  In Aurich, no so much.  Well, yeah, I remember in Dillingen, where my grandparents were.  I remember in Luxembourg.  Again, about my mother--my father was Orthodox, didn't wear a beard, he didn't wear }{\i\fs24 peyes}{\fs24 
 [side curls], but he laid the }{\i\fs24 tefillin}{\fs24  [phylacteries].
\par NL:\tab Did he?  That's interesting.  Totally assimilated man...
\par SS:\tab And totally kosher.
\par NL:\tab German.
\par SS:\tab I mean, I remember a story onetime when he came home because he traveled during the day and came home late at night, so I knew him relatively less 
well than I know my mother.  I remember him coming home and being really sick to his stomach, and what had happened is he had eaten at some peasants.  And I don't know how it happened, because he was very cautious.  He thought he had eaten pork, and he ju
st spent the rest of the day vomiting.
\par NL:\tab So you were raised very much in a Jewish religious tradition?
\par SS:\tab Well, a crazy one, because of my mother.  This crazy lady had five sets of dishes--}{\i\fs24 milchig}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 fleischig}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 milchig}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 fleischig}{\fs24  for }{\i\fs24 Pesach}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 trayf}
{\fs24  [dairy, meat, not kosher].  And whenever my father was away, she would ceremoniously pull out the }{\i\fs24 trayf}{\fs24  dishes.  And we'd have }{\i\fs24 trayf}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab Wonderful.
\par SS:\tab But, she never contaminated the dishes.  We always had two kitchen tables, two sinks, two everything.
\par NL:\tab Two kitchen tables--that I've never heard of.
\par SS:\tab Two sets of towels?
\par NL:\tab Two sets of--two tables?  Extraordinary.
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab Do you remember any Eastern European Jews in the town?
\par SS:\tab No, no.
\par NL:\tab This is probably a little too far west for them, I would think they might...
\par SS:\tab Right, right.
\par NL:\tab Poland or Russia?
\par SS:\tab No. And you know, as I mentioned, in Milwaukee and in Chicago, there is this whole colony of people from Aurich that I would have nothing to do with.  I really don't like these people at all.
\par NL:\tab Sometimes this syndrome is associated with a certain smugness, but obviously this wasn't true of your family.
\par SS:\tab Ah, petty, greedy...
\par NL:\tab ...provincial...
\par SS:\tab The reason that my accent is as bas
tardly as it is, when I came to the United States in 1947, I was 16 years old.  I came by myself to join these relatives, and, I had forgotten German, because it was important during the War in France that I do, but at home these people only spoke German,
 and when I spoke English, they corrected me with their German accent.  So I came to Milwaukee to learn English!
\par NL:\tab You were under many different contradictory influences.
\par SS:\tab Yes.  I came to Milwaukee to learn English, but instead, I had to learn German.
\par NL:\tab Your English is fine.
\par SS:\tab Thank you.
\par NL:\tab Did you go to school in Aurich?
\par SS:\tab No.  I was under five.  But, an interesting thing when I lived with my grandparents okay.  In 1935 or 1936--I think, it was '35, there was the plebiscite, the Saar plebiscite, was it, do you know if...?
\par NL:\tab '35.
\par SS:\tab '35.  Since my grandparents were from the Saar and yesterday when I looked through some of these documents for you, there was mention of that, too--apparently, my parents, during those years and even though they liv
ed in Aurich, assumed or operated under a Saar citizenship.  And since they opted--so during the plebiscite, as you well know--it meant that the Saar population could vote with it to become French or German, and, for all I know, the results were rigged in
 favor of Germany.
\par NL:\tab Overwhelmingly.
\par SS:\tab Overwhelmingly.  Anyway, as people who had voted for France, they were given the option to leave, and it is under these conditions that they left, and I think that explains also, why the year.
\par NL:\tab Excuse me.  Why did they prefer France?  Can you tell me that?  Do you know that?
\par SS:\tab I don't, except that...
\par NL:\tab Well, Hitler was already in power.
\par SS:\tab Hitler was in power.  I have one memory of--well, my mother, by virtue of her Swiss schooling and Swiss--in the French Swiss-spoke French fluently, and so would have been Francophile...
\par NL:\tab Oh, so they were obviously afraid of...
\par SS:\tab They were afraid.

\par 
\par SS:\tab The one memory that I do have of Hitler was walking down the streets of Aurich with my mother.  I might say that when I went back to Aurich in 1953, and I'll explain later my purpose for going, which was monetary, in my head Aurich was a small }{
\i\fs24 Dorf}{\fs24  [village], you know, a little speck on the map!  In fact, I was awed--it's a big city.  It's a city.
\par NL:\tab Of course it has grown.
\par SS: \tab It has grown, but still...
\par NL:\tab Do you remember it as a tiny place?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.  In part, because, also, one of the early stories was an aunt who lived toward the center of Aurich, ma
rketplace, and we lived, I guess, where the river was, more the outskirts of town.  Whenever I didn't like things at home, that is, with my mother, I would just take off and cross town and go to my aunt's.  All by myself!
\par NL:\tab You were an independent child!
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes, I was very independent.
\par NL:\tab That's so much in conflict with the norms of that German-Jewish upper class, upper-middle class culture.  Little girls just didn't do those things.
\par SS:\tab Well, you know...
\par NL:\tab ...did they?
\par SS:\tab I have a feeling that this country's head is full of mushy stereotypes, which in fact, may or may not apply.
\par NL:\tab But--you were unusual, weren't you?  A girl of your age...
\par SS:\tab I had an unusual mother.
\par NL:\tab But most Jewish mothers weren't like your mother in Aurich.
\par SS:\tab Right, right.
\par NL:\tab So, you broke out...
\par SS:\tab You asked me about toys--I remember the earliest toy that I remember.  There were dolls, and as photos will attest to, I didn't like dolls.  And there are pictures of me with 
dolls.  Maybe you can find--I didn't like them.  She gave me an erector set, and I loved it.
\par NL:\tab That's interesting.  I didn't like dolls either.
\par SS:\tab But anyway, so the earliest early memory was walking down the streets of Aurich, the shopping center, with
 my mother, when all of a sudden there were all kinds of sounds, noises, and this was, I guess, Hitler coming through town with his entourage, and I remember my mother just pulling me and running into a store.  And, again, unlike American brats today, one
 didn't say, "Why do I have to go with you, Mommy?" You just did it.  You felt it, You did it.  Maybe that's a difference.  Children did not challenge...
\par NL:\tab ...authority.
\par SS:\tab ...the adults.  That's...
\par NL:\tab Can you tell us now why Mother and Dad, Mother and Father, separated from you in '35 or '36, and why you went to Luxembourg while they went to France?
\par SS:\tab I--you know, at the time, 1936, I was five years old, so I was not privy to...
\par NL:\tab Can you re- 
\par SS:\tab No, all I remember was that it was happy to be with 
my grandparents in Ettelbruck and my assumption--Ettelbruck is in Luxembourg--and my assumption would be that they wanted the time to resettle and get their affairs and everything in order.  But, again, it was a happy time.
\par NL:\tab It was a happy time?
\par SS:\tab Sur
e.  I was the first grandchild, much adored.  I remember, you know, you asked about other kids.  I always wore silk clothes, and always had something which I have thought since as being very neat--the underwear matched the dress.  So that when the boys wo
uld flip up the dress, you know, it was all matching.
\par NL:\tab Oh, that was real elegance.
\par SS:\tab Right.  And because my recollection of myself was that I was sort of, not a very neat little girl, whenever I got dirty, they changed my clothes and got me }{\i\fs24 angeputzt}{\fs24  [dressed up].
\par NL:\tab In an ensemble?  And where did Mother and Father go? What city of France?
\par SS:\tab They didn't go to a city.  They moved into a village by the name of Rocquigny, R-O-C-Q-U-I-G-N-Y, which is in the Ardennes.
\par NL:\tab And Father planned to re-establish his business there, or...?
\par SS:\tab Yes, he did.  They bought a house and he had cattle and did the same thing he did in Germany.  And judging by letters that I have, documents, which appear to be character references, apparently he did well, was highly respe
cted and liked.  And unlike her, he didn't know French and learned it.  In fact, someplace I found a little book that he used to study French for vocabulary.  So my stay with my grandparents was a happy one.
\par NL:\tab And how long did you stay with them?
\par SS:\tab I would imagine, I think it was about a year.  But, you know, my parents would come and go and visit.  The interesting thing is, again, keeping in mind that my grandfather was an Orthodox man.  I remember him saying, and I remember going to }{
\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24  with them in Ettelbruck, being very condescending of Jews who used organ music in }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 , and he said, "When people listen to music, they don't pray." So he was against it.
\par NL:\tab And you remembered that?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.  To this day, I don't feel comfortable in a Reformed }{\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 \endash at all.  In fact, if anything, I would characterize myself as an Orthodox atheist.
\par NL:\tab Oh! I wasn't prepared for that!
\par SS:\tab I'm both.  If I relate to anything Jewish, then the feelings are Orthodox tradition, and so on.  Okay.  Anyway, my one--I have many memories of Ettelbruck\endash 
but one I remember in particular was being in a religious Catholic, run by nuns, school.  And I remember that--it must have been at Christmastime, because there was the cr\'e9che, you know, with the little porcelain Holy Family, and w
here the big treat was for every child to be able to hold the little Jesus--and I think I dropped it.
\par NL:\tab And it broke?
\par SS:\tab But...
\par NL:\tab Were you punished?
\par SS:\tab No...
\par NL:\tab Or reprimanded?
\par SS:\tab Not really.  But it was understood that children are clumsy, or something like that, and you shouldn't do it, and I felt bad.
\par NL:\tab Were there other Jewish children in the school?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.  I don't remember.  That's the only...
\par NL:\tab You don't remember feeling conspicuous as a Jewish child, especially?
\par SS:\tab As a child, as I said, I was well-fed, well-nourished, well taken care of.  I never felt deprived.
\par NL:\tab But in the school setting?
\par SS:\tab No, I didn't.  But it occurred to me as an adult, reflecting upon that, apparently my grandfather foresaw something, or a lot, and that that was part of a kind of training he wanted me to have--to know how to get along with }{\i\fs24 goyim}{\fs24 
 [non-Jews].
\par NL:\tab Aha!  Or was it their adaptation?
\par SS:\tab No, I don't think so.  Remember, the man was an Orthodox Jewish man.
\par NL:\tab He couldn't very well conceal his beard.
\par SS:\tab He didn't wear a beard.
\par NL:\tab He didn't wear a beard.
\par SS:\tab None of them wore beards.  Okay, to give you a sense of that--my grandfather died of illness in 1938.  It was some kind
 of cancer, skin, excruciatingly painful, and, again, it's the same story all over again.  I have one of the cousins who imported me, facilitated my coming to the United States, in Chicago, was a physician.  And the same story--I couldn't get any meaningf
ul information about my family.  Now, I understand that what he died of was a kind of condition that is rare but predominantly found among Jews.  And I mentioned that to a friend who's a dermatologist once, who could name it...
\par NL:\tab And there is that pattern?
\par SS:\tab 
There is that, and I forget what it was.  Anyway, so he died of illness in 1938.  He was transported from Luxembourg to a hospital in Strasbourg in France.  That's also where he's buried.  And my mother apparently had promised him that she would neve
r smoke on }{\i\fs24 Shabbes}{\fs24 .  And my mother, like I, or I, like my mother, was a chain smoker, and I never knew her to smoke on }{\i\fs24 Shabbes}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 Yom Kippur}{\fs24 
, even after he died.  You know, what I'm saying about this sense of...
\par NL:\tab Yes, yes.  Very strong sense of uh...
\par SS:\tab Commitment...
\par NL:\tab The appropriateness of these values.
\par SS:\tab A commitment.
\par NL:\tab A commitment.  Yeah.  Past death.
\par SS:\tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab In Luxembourg itself, through the 30's--well, you were there only a year...
\par SS:\tab One year.
\par NL:\tab And you were a very little girl.  You don't have any sense, either, as a result of your experiences at the time or what you learned about the situation later, were there any rumbling of neo-Nazism or Nazism...?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.
\par NL:\tab Were Jews suffering in Luxembourg?
\par SS:\tab I know that my grandparents were absolutely, as you noticed on the photos, you know, they look upon me as the adored child.  They were extremely proud of the fact that I learned to speak the Luxembourg, which is a }{\i\fs24 Plattdeutsch}{\fs24 
 [Low German], fluently.
\par NL:\tab I see.  You picked it up in that year?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  And you know, this delighted them.
\par NL:\tab There were apparently no ominous signs during that year--political signs.
\par SS:\tab I'm sure there were.  I'm sure that there were.  I mean, I remember, that 
image is mostly in France, listening to the radio, I'm hearing Hitler blasting out in the familiar dog bark.  Yes, I think that one sensed it, that it was there, but obviously at age five or six, I had no way, really, I don't think, of conceptualizing it.

\par NL:\tab And so, after a year, Mother and Father then took you with them?  Is that what happened?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  Then I came to France, and I didn't know a damn word of French, so...
\par NL:\tab You had to learn it.
\par SS:\tab ...at age seven, I guess, I learned French.
\par NL:\tab Best time in the world to learn a language, isn't it?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab You picked it up quickly, I'm sure.  And what were some of your impressions of the French school?  You were enrolled in a school, I suppose.  Was that a difficult adjustment for you?
\par SS:\tab It was 
difficult because by the time I got there, they were doing fractions that I didn't know.  I didn't know how to do fractions.  It was difficult because of the way the French do divisions, for example, is different from the way they do divisions in Germany.
 
 So it was difficult for my parents to help me, that kind of thing.  But, then, that was good training.  That became a way of life, because during the ten years that I lived in France, I once counted having attended something--I don't remember--I told you
 once--how many schools. 
\par BL:\tab Fourteen.
\par SS:\tab For the ten years I lived in 14 different places, and I don't know, I was in school, I wasn't in school, you know.
\par NL:\tab For how long a time were things relatively equable for your family?
\par SS:\tab In France?  Well, 1939, my father volunteered into the French army, so he left.
\par NL:\tab Excuse me--as far as you know, out of some feeling of identification with the anti-Nazi cause?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab And/or a way of achieving French citizenship, or had he already acquired that?
\par SS:\tab Oh, no!  Come on!  You know very well that you could be in France for 582 years and never attain French citizenship.
\par NL:\tab But I thought service in the army accelerated that process.  Anyhow, it's not relevant here at all.
\par SS:\tab Maybe.  No, I think more--for a
 long, long time, I was--I succumbed to the Bruno Bettelheims, and the Hannah Arendt notion of Jews being led to the slaughter like sheep, you know?  And I really felt angry at some level, or anguish about my parents not having come to America when they h
ad the money, about not having gone into hiding when they could have or should have.  And yet, as I alone struggled through this, I returned back to: "But, who are these people, my parents?"  That's what I said--"}{\i\fs24 Un homme sa parole}{\fs24 
"--and I remember my fathe
r saying, "Why should I hide?  God knows I am an honest man.  Honest men do not hide." I mean, there was this kind of--at some point, I must judge it, and I put it down as a kind of naive, blind, you know, religion kind of thing.  In fact, I was wrong.  I
 
was profoundly wrong.  This man had principles.  This man, at age 39, not knowing the language, joined the French army.  He was ready for combat.  Now, you want to play Tweedlededee or Tweedlededum: Did he do it to save the family, to get citizenship, wha
tever?  He enrolled in the army in war.
\par NL:\tab He believed in what he was doing.
\par SS:\tab Obviously.  Obviously.
\par NL:\tab And the Bettelheims and the Hannah Arendts, I think, are doing an ex post facto sort of judgment.  This is how I interpret it.
\par SS:\tab Well, I don't like Bettelheim at all.  I mean...
\par NL:\tab But, your father obviously didn't want to change his whole system of values simply because the world was changing or seemed to have been changing.
\par SS:\tab Isn't that the hallmark of a genuine Orthodox Jew?
\par NL:\tab And this eternality of values, you see, he was committed to that.
\par SS:\tab Right.  But, I mean, you know, there was a story that you know better, maybe I read it in your book, about on }{\i\fs24 Yom Kippur}{\fs24 , how the Jews--it was the atheist Jews in Auschwitz who refused to eat.
\par NL:\tab Yes.  So Father enlisted.  What was their life like let's say in '38 after Munich?  Have you recapitulated that?
\par SS:\tab Well, we lived in Rocquigny, in this }{\i\fs24 Dorf}{\fs24 .  I remember traveling up and back to visit my grandparents in Luxembourg.  My mother's brother married a Belgian lady, and they lived in Belgium.
\par NL:\tab Did you sense any greater anxiety in your parents as the decade drew on?  You were very young, of course, but do you recall any anxiety on their part--'38?
\par SS:\tab You know, I don't know how to describe that.  Let me try to formulate it.  No, no.  Let me try to describe that.  I didn't mean to pass over.  Among the very vivid memories, I mean so vivid, I can feel it, I can see it, was, I was three ti
mes in concentration camps with my parents, twice in Gurs, once in Rivesaltes.  On each occasion, I can clearly see all or most of the other people about crying and sobbing and whatever.  I have no recall, not a single one, of my parents behaving that way
.
  I remember my mother organizing, carrying the big containers of food with somebody else, and whatever little pieces of solid there were in this soup, this slop, were at the bottom, and my mother organizing that whatever comes out of the bottom goes to t
he children first.  The rest could be distributed among the adults.
\par NL:\tab She was taking charge.
\par SS:\tab Yes.  So that--truly, how can I answer your question?  I don't know that I can.  I think that I do have some letters that my mother wrote to my father.  They'
re written in German and I can't read German that well, but which do describe, I think, some of her struggles with trying to get monies or whatever.
\par NL:\tab But in the pre-war period, you don't remember any growing anxiety about the place?  I'm just trying, I'm groping for some understanding of why your father enlisted before France was involved.
\par SS:\tab It was involved in '39.  He enlisted in 1939.
\par NL:\tab Yes, but France wasn't occupied, until 1940.
\par SS:\tab Until what?
\par NL:\tab Until 1940.  Maybe it was the attack on Poland.
\par SS:\tab Maybe.
\par NL:\tab Because there was a technical alliance between England and France to support the viability of Poland.  Maybe it was that.  Well, it's not that important.  Where did he go when he enlisted?  Where was he taken to?  Do you know?
\par SS:\tab We looked at these documents last night, and it wouldn't be in here.  Anyway, some camps--I had forgotten that--I had quite forgotten that--but he ended up in some camp, Saint-Just, in the }{\i\fs24 departement de Oise}{\fs24 
, and from there, he was sent to Gurs.
\par NL:\tab From the army?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  See, here is a letter that my father had written }{\i\fs24 Monsieur le Pr\'e9fet }{\i\f28\fs24 \'42}{\i\fs24  Pau}{\fs24  the 26th of August 1940.  I don't know if you read French, but I can translate it for you.  You know what a }{\i\fs24 
pr\'e9fet}{\fs24  [chief administrator] is.  "I have the honor to present 
to you the following facts: In April 1939, I had myself inscribed at the gendarmerie at the police, of Chaumont-Porcien, Ardennes, with the intent to enlist in the French army.  The first September of the same year, I signed an engagement with the Bureau 
o
f Recruitment, [SS injects a few French phrases here and there as she translates] also in the Ardennes."  Now, he was working, I think, on rewriting and rewriting this.  Again, his French wasn't that good.  "Following my internment the 5th of September 19
39," you see, he said, in April he enlisted and in September, "following the decree taken against foreigners, I was interned in the camp of St. Just en Chauss\'e9e, Oise."}{\fs24\super 1{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar

\par SS:\tab But you saw the photo, he was wearing a French uniform...
\par NL:\tab Yes, but this is very, very interesting, the first time I ever hear about what is, in effect, the deportation to a camp before France was conquered, and this...
\par SS:\tab There is one other reference to that--you know, until I found this, I thoug
ht I'd made it up.  There's one other reference.  There's a woman by the name of--and I don't have the book, I think my daughter has it, a woman who wrote children's stories called Sachs, S-A-C-H-S, who wrote a children's story called }{\i\fs24 
A Pocket Full of Marbles}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab Oh, yes.
\par SS:\tab Do you know that?
\par NL:\tab I just know the title.
\par SS:\tab Okay.  Now, she describes the story that was told her of a woman named Fanny Kruger, whom I know, who's in San Francisco, and her father too, according to the book, had joined this same outfit, }{\i\fs24 prestataire}{\fs24 , and he too.
\par NL:\tab ...he, too, was sent to a camp.
\par SS:\tab And ended up in Auschwitz.  Right.
\par NL:\tab This was long--not long, but it was a full year before the Vichy decrees--the }{\i\fs24 Statut des Juifs}{\fs24 \endash before the capitulation of the Reynaud regime, b
efore Petain came on. This was an independent decision of the French government, and we know that they didn't--well, you know, Koestler's book, }{\i\fs24 The Scum of the Earth}{\fs24 
, in which he talks about the camps in France that had been used originally for persons who had fought in the Spanish Civil War.
\par SS:\tab Right.  That was what Gurs was set up to be.
\par NL:\tab And Gurs was one of those.  We really--I really must find out what there was in the motivation of the French to deport people who were already in the French army.
\par SS:\tab No, no, he wasn't deported...
\par NL: \tab Well, it's a deportation.
\par SS: \tab Well, it's putting them in a camp.
\par NL: \tab Well, it's an internment.
\par SS:\tab It's an internment.
\par NL:\tab Yeah, it's an internment. Obviously, they weren't acknowledging his commitment to the French army.  That's something that I will certainly want to investigate.  It is, because this is pre-Vichy, and...
\par SS:\tab You know, I might comment on this.  Before I called you, as I told you I--do you want to take that off?
\par NL: \tab Let me just repeat for a moment.  You were saying that Mother probably had some reserve or some savings so that you and she could manage without Father...
\par SS:\tab You remember I said, well, because of the situation of the plebiscite, my grandparents, Hoffmans, as well as my parents, I think, were given some amount of ability to liquidate their businesses at a great...
\par NL:\tab Sacrifice...
\par SS:\tab Sacrifice, but nonetheless 
\par NL:\tab ...they...
\par SS:\tab I don't think they were...
\par NL:\tab ...were able to liquidate...
\par SS:\tab They didn't get the full value, let's put it t
his way.  While my father was in the so-called French army, I was with my mother in the village of Rocquigny, and here is a photo.  This is my mother.  These are French officers, and I remember that they came for dinner, and they seemed to be pretty chumm
y.
\par NL:\tab You remember Father's coming home in his uniform?
\par SS:\tab No, I never; no, he never came home.
\par NL:\tab He never came home, on leave.
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab For those few months.
\par SS:\tab But then, in 1940, and you would know the date better than I, as I said, I forgot.  Aft
er a while, I forgot all the dates.  Sometime in 1940, there was the evacuation of northern France as a result of the Germans bombarding all of the towns and civilians.
\par NL:\tab May and June of '40, I think.
\par SS:\tab May and June of 1940.  So when--that's when that part of France was evacuated, and, in fact, there's a French movie about that that begins with the evacuation.  I think it was either "}{\i\fs24 Jeu de Guerre}{\fs24 
" or, I forget which one, where most people fled on foot.  Now, my mother and I took a train to LaRoche-sur-
Yon, which is right here on the Atlantic Coast.  In other words, we went from the Ardennes to LaRoche-sur-Yon, and this was the area that had been designated as the area of evacuation for people from Ardennes, okay?
\par NL:\tab The French government authorized that, or arranged it.
\par SS:\tab Whatever.  Now, given a letter that my mother wrote, the last thing before I was separated from my parents, she wrote a will which is this: "Camp de Rivesaltes, on 13 September 1942, in which she indicates that the furniture was in L
aRoche-sur-Yon, which means that she must have had the opportunity to move all belongings from the Ardennes to LaRoche-sur-Yon.  Because unlike the rest of the French population, I have no recall...
\par NL:\tab You didn't walk, you were on the train...
\par SS:\tab Exactly.  And this document would confirm it.
\par NL:\tab Um hm.
\par SS:\tab Incidentally, you asked me how did I retrieve the photos.  In part, it was through the person, the friend who had been entrusted with the furniture, which was put it in a storage...
\par NL:\tab Container?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  In LaRoche-sur-Yon, he sold everything but saved the albums.
\par NL:\tab I see.  He saved the papers.
\par SS:\tab Okay.  Then...
\par NL:\tab Could we just step back a minute...

\fs24 
\par 
\par NL:\tab This is Tape 2, continuing an interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.  We were talking about the evacuation from your home just at the time of the bombardments, probably in June, May or June of 1940.  Do you remember the bombardments?
\par SS: \tab No.
\par NL:\tab You think Mother and you left before...
\par SS:\tab I think so.
\par NL:\tab ...that happened?  She had some indication that there was danger?
\par NL:\tab I think so.  From Rocquigny, I remember that there was a neighbor, Breck, who was a garage mechanic.  And I used to spend a tremendous amount of time watching him repair cars, and he was an elderly man, I guess...
\par NL:\tab 40...\tab [laughter]
\par SS:\tab Not really, because he used to, yeah, well okay.  He used to talk and tell lots of stories of World War I and the French were very much for World War I.  That's hard to say, World War I.  And it was very vivid.  After the war
, I returned to France in 1953.  I returned to Rocquigny.  I saw this man and was, when I told him who I was, his greeting was, "Oh, I thought you were all dead."  And that was the beginning, middle and the end.
\par NL:\tab Same thing happened in Poland.  Yes, not much difference.  So you don't remember any bombardment, and you and Mother took the train, whereas the other evacuees went by foot, or many of them did.
\par SS: \tab Right.
\par NL:\tab And so you think you left as a result of a government order?
\par SS:\tab Or it may just have 
been foresight on their part.  They had a lot of foresight, except, as I said, to come to America.  But there is something to be said about their notion: you don't flee, you fight, and that seemed to have been my father's position.
\par NL:\tab And then that comment made, which I don't think we have on tape.  "An honest man is protected by God."
\par SS: \tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab Why should he have anything to fear?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  Only honest.  "God knows I am honest, and honest people have nothing to hide."  Right?
\par NL:\tab Now, Father was still at Gurs when you were evacuated?
\par SS:\tab No, no, no.  As best as I recall, there were no news from my father.  From LaRoche-sur-Yon--I'm trying to see, 1940, my mother and I were in LaRoche-sur-Yon.  I wrote this sometime from memory.  Fr
om LaRoche-sur-Yon, my mother and I ended up in Gurs in 1940.
\par NL:\tab What about your life in LaRoche-sur-Yon?
\par SS:\tab I remember living in a hotel.  I remember eating lobster, and the goodies, }{\i\fs24 trayf}{\fs24  [not kosher].  It was an ocean city.
\par NL:\tab Without the fifth set of dishes?
\par SS: \tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Did Mother seem to be somewhat relaxed?  Do you recall anything about her behavior that was different?
\par SS:\tab Somehow, as you ask, the word does not seem to relate to my mother.  My mother was a funny lady, a very open lady, a very e
ccentric lady, a fun lady.  She could be a very angry lady, but I'm not so sure about anything in between.  That, of course, may be a function of my age.  You know, I always felt very loved and protected and so on.
\par NL:\tab And in a happy setting with her?
\par SS:\tab Right.  And all I remember really was that I was with her.
\par NL:\tab Were there other children in the hotel?  Were there other Jews in the hotel?
\par SS:\tab I have no idea.
\par NL:\tab You don't know.
\par SS:\tab No idea.  Anyway, let me talk about what I remember.
\par NL:\tab Please.
\par SS:\tab Rat
her than what I don't.  My mother and I ended up in Gurs.  As I mentioned, we had not heard from my father.  As you well know, Gurs, like all the other camps, were sub-sectioned into islands, each one partitioned off.  They called it--well, anyway, each o
n
e closed off with barbed wires, and whenever a new transport arrived, there were all kinds of communications going on, people across the barbed wire, separated by ditches.  Asking, you know, names, who arrived and that's how we found that my father was in
 Gurs.
\par NL:\tab My--and the first knowledge...
\par SS: \tab Right.
\par NL:\tab That he was, in about a year and a half?
\par SS:\tab I would think so, unless my mother heard from him, then I would have had some recall of...
\par NL:\tab The news.
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  I might add, in passing, and, you know
, I guess, just for the sake of a description that you asked of what it was like and so on.  I might add that my mother and father were--I don't think they had done anything formal, but it was understood that they were going to divorce.  And this was true
 
already when we lived in Rocquigny, and the man that she was involved with was a man that I recall.  I have quite a clear memory of him, and I guess the interesting thing about that is that my father knew about it, but that through none of the ordeal, I t
h
ink the last that this man was in the picture that I recall was in LaRoche-sur-Yon.  I think, he was the one who oversaw the furniture and sold them to survive.  He was a Jew, a man by the name of George Levy; he was a French Jew.  But that had nothing wi
t
h, to do with, you know, as there are in here letters that my mother wrote to my father.  They wrote letters of mutual concern and caring, and certainly that was true in the camp and afterwards, so that a divorce was a grownup issue that had no effect.  D
oes that help to put in perspective what these people are like?
\par NL:\tab Yes.  I also am wondering if perhaps the imminence of the divorce might have had something to do with Father's decision to enlist in the army?  But that's really irrelevant, I think.
\par SS:\tab I think it would be irrelevant.
\par NL:\tab Yeah, I think it's just a speculation.
\par SS: \tab Even then it was 1939.
\par NL:\tab Yeah.
\par SS:\tab The man was 39 years old, and he's not a kid, on the rebound.  You know, people didn't think that way in those days.
\par NL:\tab Do you have any specific images of life at Gurs?  Were you with Mother?  Did you sleep in the same area?  Was it a barracks-type of thing?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, they were wooden barracks.  
\par NL:\tab Wooden barracks.  Did you go there by train?
\par SS:\tab We went there by train.  Well, you see, bec
ause I went to Gurs twice.  Let me get--maybe, we'll hold the detailed questions for a moment, and let me just give a brief chronology.  From the camp of Gurs in 1940, we got out of Gurs, and up until '42, we lived in a village near Gurs, called Garlin.  
H
owever, my father lived in a village not some distance away, where he had a small farm, and he commuted, that is, visited my mother and myself, on a bicycle.  He had one bicycle, and I used to ride on the front thing of the bicycle.  And I recall frequent
 visits, my father coming to visit, and my going there to stay with him.  As some of these letters would show, where my mother wrote to him while I was there.
\par NL:\tab So then he was released from Gurs, too?
\par SS:\tab Yes, the three of us were together in Gurs, once we found each other.  Okay.
\par NL:\tab I see. once you found each other, you were together.
\par SS: \tab We were together.  And this was until August 26, 1942.  August 26, 1942, was my mother's birthday, and for her birthday my father was coming to spend the day with us a
nd bring a chicken or whatever, you know, to celebrate her birthday, which, again, is what I am saying about.  Here are two people, who had in peacetime thought of divorce, and in wartime like, you know, it didn't exist.  You know, it was there, but it wa
sn't.
\par NL:\tab Yes.  Take some coffee.
\par SS:\tab Instead--that's all right.  Instead of my father coming on that day, the 26th of August, a truck came with the French police and rounded up my mother and I and we were on our way to Rivesaltes.
\par NL:\tab No warning, no preparation?  Just a sudden.
\par SS:\tab No.  No, and again, my father was already on the truck.
\par NL:\tab He was on the truck.  They had picked him up?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  If you look at the map, I indicated with an X, this is the general region where he was, so the truck, the truck 
must have come this way and from there we went to Gurs.  Now, when you ask me about details of Gurs, obviously these pictures all merged between time one and time two.
\par NL:\tab Time one was, of course, short and I presume...
\par SS:\tab So was time two.
\par NL:\tab I see.
\par SS:\tab 
Time two we were in Gurs August 26, 1942; we were transported by train to Rivesaltes on September 13, 1942.  And I think that a few days later--I would have to research it--but no more than a week or two weeks later, my parents were sent from Rivesaltes t
o Drancy.  I stayed in Rivesaltes alone until I got out.  Okay, so that's all of it, the chronology.
\par NL:\tab What was life like even in the merged images that you have at Gurs?  Did you have enough to eat?
\par SS:\tab No, of course not.  That's why I desc
ribed my mother taking charge of the food distribution, which was mostly liquid slop with some solid stuff in the bottom.  The barracks were wooden barracks, which had this shape going down and then fanning out on the sides, where you put your head to sle
ep and it was open.  It was on the ground.  I think there was some straw on the ground.
\par NL:\tab Do you have an image of lots of people there?
\par SS:\tab Oh, sure, all of the barracks were...
\par NL:\tab Filled.
\par SS:\tab Filled.  I'll talk about how I got out of Rivesaltes, to say 
something about that in a minute.  What else?  Waking up very early in the morning.  It was, I think, this must have been the first time I remember it being cold and wet and damp, and I remember waking up damp and wet.  And achy.
\par NL:\tab Achy.
\par SS:\tab In fact, the
 pain was something like the arthritic pain I have now; maybe that's where I got it.  I remember the toilets, which were sort of huge cylindrical cans.  You know, you walked up some scaffolding, some scaffolding, wooden scaffolding and there were these ca
n
s that you shat into.  It was a strange experience, certainly coming from a private bath, central heating and all the rest of it.  But the most unsettling experience was having diarrhea, stomach cramps, and alleviating oneself and never being sure whether
 it was me or the person next door, and looking down and it was all warm shit, couldn't tell if it was you or somebody else.  That kind of...
\par NL:\tab How did Mother explain this move to you?  Or don't you remember any discussion?  Did you want to know why you were being sent to such a place?
\par SS:\tab No, because I think in those days, adults didn't talk to kids.  It was understood that when you talked about stuff and you made decisions, the kids were there.  You heard and didn't barge in.
\par NL:\tab You obeyed.
\par SS: \tab It wasn
't a matter of obeying.  You had a certain kind of respect.  These are difficult times.  The adults have to make difficult decisions and they are doing the best they can, and you considered, I considered myself fortunate, you know, that it wasn't hush-hus
h and whispered, that the discussions were open, but you listened like a proper child that didn't have any wisdom or anything to contribute.
\par NL:\tab And Mother and Father and you were together?
\par SS: \tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab In the same physical area?  Did they have work?
\par SS: \tab No.
\par NL:\tab They didn't.  Well, how did they spend their days?  How did you spend your day? What would happen?
\par SS:\tab Well, sitting in...
\par NL:\tab Sitting in the barracks?  Walking?  Was there any way of walking?
\par SS:\tab There was walking.
\par NL:\tab There was walking.  Was there...?
\par SS:\tab But there was more of a tendency to stay close to one's parents.
\par NL:\tab Did you have any visitors?  Did any social agency people come to you with food or clothing...
\par SS: \tab No.
\par NL:\tab ...or medicine?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Do you remember being examined by a doctor?
\par SS:\tab No, nothing, nothing.
\par NL:\tab Okay.
\par SS:\tab Nothing, I'll tell you my Jewish agency stories.  They are very bitter.  Maybe I better move from Gurs to Rivesaltes.  I remember the long train ride.  I remember also goin
g from the train into the trucks to go to Rivesaltes.  Incidentally, there is one French movie that I saw recently that attempted to recreate exactly what was happening.  What was the name of that movie?  It was "Entre Nous".
\par NL:\tab "Entre Nous."
\par SS:\tab Did you see that movie?
\par NL:\tab No, I don't think...
\par SS:\tab The opening scene...
\par NL:\tab The opening scene--Rivesaltes?
\par SS:\tab It's quick, like, you know, two seconds.  But it is Rivesaltes.
\par NL:\tab I don't know if it has come to Philadelphia, but I certainly will.
\par SS:\tab Well, it came to Princeton.
\par NL:\tab Well, Princeton has the McCarther Theater.
\par SS:\tab No, no, it was a real commercial shopping mall.
\par NL:\tab Made in France, I presume?
\par SS:\tab Yes, yes.  Right, and the woman who produced the movie is the daughter, I mean, it's autobiographical, it's autobiographical, it's about her mother and father that she made a movie.
\par NL:\tab It was very moving?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes, but there is a scene of Rivesaltes.  I guess, she succeeded in attempting to an extent to recreating it. And as I recall, as I know, what I noticed most about the scene at Rivesaltes was the omission in the movie of the barbed wire.

\par NL:\tab Just another question. 
\par SS:\tab Excuse me while I remember.
\par NL:\tab While you remember.
\par SS:\tab Rivesaltes was then in September, 1942.  Rivesaltes, as you well know, is at t
he opposite, at the Mediterranean end of the Pyrenees.  I remember it as being unbelievably hot.  As I recall Gurs full of mud and nasty and cold and wet.  You could never keep dry or warm.  Rivesaltes the image was one of glaring, sun-beating heat, and t
here were a couple of sunflowers.  I remember picking the seeds and eating those.
\par NL:\tab Similar barracks?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab And the same general physical condition?
\par SS:\tab Uh-huh.
\par NL:\tab And not enough food?
\par SS:\tab Right.  Hungry.  Starving.
\par NL:\tab Starving?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, both, I mean, you know, this slop.  It didn't do any...
\par NL:\tab I'm going to take a minute.  Let's speak now for a moment about your school experience.
\par SS:\tab We will get back to the camp?
\par NL:\tab Of course, we will.
\par SS:\tab All right.
\par NL:\tab You were at school in Gurs?
\par SS:\tab Well, you see, when we got out of the camp of Gurs, we were in the village of Gurs, for a time.
\par NL:\tab Excuse me for interrupting.  Do you know why you were released?  Or did Mother and Father arrange that with the authorities?  Do you understand how come you were only there for a few months?
\par SS:\tab Can you turn that off for a minute?
\par NL:\tab Tell us now a little about your school life in the village of Gurs?
\par SS:\tab All right.  To date, I remember being in school in Rocquigny, which would have been 1939, 1938, 19
39, learning French.  No school, and then I think when I lived in Garlin, which was 1941, 1942, going to school there.  Okay.  I remember two things.  I remember one thing, number one, being a very good student.  I read avidly; I read everything there was
 in the...
\par NL:\tab Available.
\par SS:\tab Available.  Right.  And the teacher befriended me. She liked me.  In fact, some place I have a picture of her; her name was Mademoiselle Dominique.  And it was the tradition for, I don't know what holiday, probably Bastille Day
 or one of those that the student who did the best, scholastically, was permitted to raise the flag.
\par NL:\tab A great honor.
\par SS:\tab And so I was designated to do that and the whole village got into an uproar about a Jew doing that.  Now, this was 1941, '42.
\par NL:\tab After the }{\i\fs24 Statut des Juifs}{\fs24 .
\par SS:\tab Right.  So I didn't do it.
\par NL:\tab You didn't do it?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab The teacher had to back down?
\par SS:\tab Right.  Had to back down, right.  The principal had to back down.
\par NL:\tab But, you did get this feeling of support from the teacher?  How about the other students?  Do you remember any nastiness among them?
\par SS:\tab No, no.  In Garlin and the village of Gurs, which is at the foot of the Pyrenees, which is, you know, across the street
 from Spain, bullfighting was the big sport.  So, they had these old bullfight arenas, somewhat dilapidated.  I remember spending days playing with the kids in the...
\par NL:\tab In the arenas?
\par SS:\tab In the arenas, right.
\par NL:\tab So, there was no persecution by the children, as happened elsewhere?
\par SS:\tab No. As long as, and I think, that's what I alluded to earlier, which was as long as you went along with whatever the games were, the kids I remember, going off with some boys.  Children also worked, like, tending to cattle,
 walking way off into, you know, the mountains and so on.  And, I remember a boy teaching me how to make a flute.
\par NL:\tab A flute?
\par SS:\tab You know, whittling wood and so on.  My mother was very, very ill.  She, she, I think, must have had polyps in the uterus.  Because she bled profusely, and required surgery, and I remember living there and taking care of her.  And...
\par NL:\tab Was she able to get hospital care?
\par SS: \tab No.
\par NL:\tab Who did the surgery?
\par SS:\tab She didn't get surgery.  She just continually bled.
\par NL:\tab Just continually bled.  And you tended her?
\par SS:\tab And I tended her.
\par NL:\tab And Father at that point was...?
\par SS:\tab He lived.  Ah...
\par NL:\tab He lived apart?
\par SS:\tab He lived apart, but then there had been another reason other than the separation, because I remember long periods when the three of us lived together and periods of separation.
\par NL:\tab I see, separation.
\par SS:\tab And, judging from the writings it may have been that he was looking about to find a place and so on.  But, I do remember tending her.  You know, I remember memories like her 
lying down and, of course, there was no plumbing, and using a bedpan, and I remember to empty it, and I remember one day tripping and...
\par NL:\tab Spilling the blood.
\par SS:\tab ...blood covered.  And feeling bad about not wanting her to see it, because she felt bad.  I remember cutting wood, you know, and going out in fields and gathering wood for heat and for cooking.
\par NL:\tab Was this a hiding place?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab You were living there freely?  But in very primitive conditions?
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Farmstead, was it?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I remember various places. But back about this school.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab In France, they have the exam, which the English call the 11-plus.  You take at age 11, which determines whether you can go on, pass the damn thing, you go on.
\par NL:\tab To college?
\par SS:\tab To college.}{\fs24\super 2{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {

  You fail it and you are put in a vocational track.  I remember going to the major city, Pau.  I think, it was Pau to take the exam, and it was a long ordea
l, a long production.  Excuse me, anyway I remember the day that the results were announced.  My mother had sent me to the store to get something.  I bumped into the teacher who yelled at me, "You passed, you passed," and hugging me.
\par NL:\tab The same teacher who...?
\par SS:\tab The same teacher, right.  And you know, but the exams were done elsewhere, and they were sent from the Ministry and so the teachers had nothing to do with it.  I remember after then, you know, we bade each other goodbye, the teacher and I and I 
am going on to the store, and the teacher yelled at me and she said, "But you live the opposite way.  Aren't you going to run home and tell your mother?" And I said, "No.  I have an errand.  I have to go to the store." So, I went and did the errand, went 
home and told my mother all excited, "I passed, I passed," and my mother just looking at me with a warm smile, saying, "Well, I expected that of you." Okay.
\par NL:\tab Of course.  That's lovely.
\par SS:\tab There is another story about my mother in the same village, in Ga
rlin.  And you asked about how did children occupy themselves.  Well, we had a hunch some kids and I, and as I said, part of not being pointed at as a Jew or ostracized or whatever, was to share in whatever activities, mischief , and whatever went on.  An
y
way, that day some kids noticed two lovers who were walking down the road into the fields, and it was decided to follow them, which we did.  We ended up in a field, and there were bushes and what not, and sometime later we saw these two young people havin
g sexual intercourse, and we were gawking, and a lady showed up.  And she screamed and yelled, "I'm going to tell the teacher.  I'm going to tell the principal!"
\par NL:\tab There were two of you or a gang?
\par SS:\tab A gang.  And so we ran like hell, and I came home all 
out of breath and looking terrified, and my mother looked at me and she said, "Good God, what happened?" And I told her, you know, exactly what I had seen, what happened, and she just howled.  She said, "You don't think he was going to follow you and try 
to catch you, with no pants on, do you?"
\par NL:\tab But you were then completely accepted by the kids?
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Then, I gather you didn't wear a Jewish star and did Mother not wear a Jewish star?
\par SS:\tab No.  Now remember, this was in so-called unoccupied France.
\par NL:\tab This was Vichy?
\par SS:\tab The year is 1942.
\par NL:\tab 1942.
\par SS:\tab '41. '42.
\par NL:\tab Did you hear about a man named Vallat V-A-L-L-A-T-, who was in a Commissariat for Jewish Affairs, who actually stood on principle about not, about refusing to accept the decree?
\par SS:\tab No. I read about it afterwards.
\par NL:\tab So, you weren't required to identify yourselves as Jews in any way?
\par SS:\tab In fact, my parents did.  There is a document here in which they did declare themselves as Jews. 
\par NL:\tab They had to register?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab The registration was something, but you didn't have the Jewish star.  And do you want to speak about any other school experiences you had in the village of Gurs?
\par SS:\tab I think there will be more as we go on.
\par NL:\tab But, do you think the children knew you were Jewish?  I mean, perhaps they didn't. 
\par SS:\tab No, you see, at that time and that's the cloak, the disguise, that I used later when I was in the French underground; they must have known because the incident about raising the flag.
\par NL:\tab Oh, yes.
\par SS: \tab But  kids were aware of the evacuation of people from northern France, so that there were refugees all over the country, which was not specific to Jews.
\par NL:\tab I also wanted to emphasize the point that Dr. Lerner was making, namely, that the arrests and the driving of the trucks, the repression, were all in the hands of French rather than German police?
\par SS:\tab Right.  They were French police.
\par NL:\tab French police.

\par 
\par NL:\tab Continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.
\par SS:\tab Okay.  Now, let's go back to Rivesaltes.
\par NL:\tab You were there just for a very short time?
\par SS:\tab Right, with my parents.
\par NL:\tab With your parents.
\par SS:\tab And, then a short time alone.  I think that the feeling of now, for now and what 
next may be worse, to me prior to that, that is, in Garlin, that feeling was heightened by--there was a girl, I remember.  She was older than I in school.  I used to spend some time with her, and her mother had recently died of illness.  And she was in mo
u
rning, and she used to talk about her mother and how she missed her and so on, and I remember very distinctly at the time, going home with greater diligence, greater anxiety, to check up on my mother, the fact that it was a double thing, the fact that my 
mother was ill and the fact of camps looming about.
\par NL:\tab The loss...
\par SS:\tab Camps looming...
\par NL:\tab Oh, camps looming.
\par SS:\tab Sure.  I had been in Gurs once before.
\par NL:\tab But, I thought the fear that you, too, might lose your mother?
\par SS:\tab Oh, sure.  That was the point. 
 That was the point.  So that, you know, you asked me about memories as a child in the camps.  Maybe, this is the part that, and the reason that I weathered it in the way that I did with my parents, my mother had promised me, and she had said, no matter w
h
at, under no circumstances ever will we separate.  And she promised me, she gave me her word, and my mother was the kind of lady that, like my father, and he, too, that a promise is a promise and you just don't break it.  So, I think that with that, my yo
u know, being quiet and sensing, accepting the ultimate security for me and my world, was okay.  I was with my mother.
\par NL:\tab They will take care of you.
\par SS:\tab I was with my father.  It wasn't even a question of who takes care, but I will be with them.  I will be with them together.
\par NL:\tab Together.
\par SS:\tab Right.  And I think that, well, that this my befriending with this girl and obviously my hanging around with her, that was part of my way of dealing with--and her position, of course, was always, "You are so lucky, y
ou still have your mother," and this kind of thing.  But I think that what was in it for me was a constant kind of dealing with, "I've got my mother.  She is there."
\par NL:\tab A rock.  Mother remained ill up until the time she was sent to Drancy?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab Never got medical care?
\par SS:\tab No, no.
\par NL:\tab Did you hear at all from your grandparents?
\par SS:\tab Yes, I'll get to that later.  Let me first...
\par NL:\tab Sure.
\par SS:\tab Install myself out of Rivesaltes.  Okay.  On that day, there was early--I, okay, the rumors about being shipp
ed out, about being transported, being deported, of course, were constant.  And there was no real way of knowing which one was a false alarm and which one was the thing.
\par NL:\tab These were rumors by the inmates?
\par SS:\tab Yes, by inmates.
\par NL:\tab Or others?  Were you able to get any newspapers?
\par SS:\tab No, nothing like that.
\par NL:\tab Radio?
\par SS:\tab No, of course not.  You know, all you could take with you was, I think, was 20 kilos.  You know, it was a suitcase, in which you typically took your blanket.  I still have my woolen blanket...
\par NL:\tab Let me interject again.  Dr. Lerner was saying that at one point Mother prepared you in very hot weather with lots and lots of clothes.  Was that when you left Rivesaltes?
\par SS:\tab No, that's wh
en we went.  Okay.  It's August 26.  It's hot.  For my mother to celebrate my mother's birthday.  Okay.  So the clothing that were packed in part consisted of the warmest you had.  You know, it was anticipated by my mother obviously, that, you know...

\par NL:\tab Things might get worse.
\par SS: \tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Or cold, certainly.  So, you were speaking about rumors.  Did you hear them as a child, too?
\par SS: \tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab You heard Mother talking?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  You heard adults always.  You know, they say that we are going to be shipped off, and the only time that I remember my mother really breaking down and crying was when the rumor was that they were going to be sent to Poland.
\par NL:\tab That scared your mother?
\par SS:\tab That frightened her.  And it's not clear whether that had to do with the old issue of the }{\i\fs24 Yekke}{\fs24  versus the }{\i\fs24 Pollack}{\fs24 
 or whether there was something, German Jew.  I suspect that it was more some sense about things being bad.
\par NL:\tab Very bad, The Jews, I think, even though they didn't know exactly what was happening there, knew tha
t Poland was the last resort.  Also, in Czechoslovakia, there was this terrible fear of being shipped to Poland, and the other side of this fear was that if they stayed with their countrymen, that they would be better protected.  Now, I wonder if there wa
s any sense that you would be better off in France simply because you were French?  But, maybe, you couldn't discern that.
\par SS:\tab There was a sense, of course, of having chosen France as a country away from Germany, and, you know, my parents did a good job of 
acculturating in a lot of ways.  Yes.  But, I remember the night before, and I think the rumors must have been, the night before they were shipped off, rumors must have been much more intense, which led more veracity and credence to them.  And, this I rem
e
mber very clearly.  And maybe this is what I am doing now, forty years later.  I remember lying down, on the floor, on whatever it was, straw whatever, and fantasizing when all this is over, I will be in America, because my mother talked a lot about these
 
relatives in America.  So, I knew the names of all the relatives.  I knew everybody's name.  I knew everybody's character, I knew what they were like, from descriptions.  And of--all I remember, like, a fantasy of my telling people in America what it was 
like.  And, of course, the let-down, when I came to America and nobody wanted to hear.  You know, leave the war behind and forget all that.
\par NL:\tab But at that time Mother was thinking of perhaps America as an alternative to her or to you or to both.
\par SS:\tab To everybody, I think.
\par NL:\tab To everybody.
\par SS:\tab I think, everybody saw that America was the place...
\par NL:\tab Everybody was thinking...
\par SS:\tab Right.  For freedom, for liberty and so on.
\par NL:\tab But, your parents did nothing as far as you know to...
\par SS:\tab To implement that?
\par NL:\tab To make this possible.  They didn't apply to leave?
\par SS:\tab Well, I don't know, because, again, in the letters there are notes that, letters that my mother wrote to my father when they lived in the different villages, involving many trips to the City of Pau wh
ich is a main capital.  In Pau, also, there was a lady who was a distant relative of my mother's friend.  She's a lady whom later I lived with, so there must have been attempts made.  The letters, by the way, cannot be taken literally because there was al
ways the danger of censorship and so on, so always...
\par NL:\tab Coded?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  But, anyway, the next morning we were awakened very early, it was still dawn, dawn is morning, and told to assemble at the main place in the camp with luggage and all, and you know,
 we formed these long lines, and the lines were alphabetical.  And given that my last name is Samson, which is my maiden name, we were pretty much down at the end of the line.  And even though my mother had promised and my father had promised, we would ne
v
er under any circumstances separate, it was decided that I should stay and that they felt that by separating there was a chance that I could get out.  So, I remember my mother going to one barrack where they had a representative of the Jewish agency, OSE 
[}{\i\fs24 Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants}{\fs24 
-Children's Aid Society].  And I remember clearly this lady then coming back to where we were in line and saying, "I'm terribly sorry, I'm sorry," and I remember, she and my mother discussing, you know, "The barrack is full.  We have no more room."
\par NL:\tab For you?
\par SS: \tab For me.
\par NL:\tab That you have to leave with them?
\par SS:\tab That I have to leave with them.  Then, of course, I was terribly relieved.  And my 
mother was terribly distressed.  And, as I remember, the way it went is the authorities which again were French-uniformed men, had a table that they transported down the line, came and people went, you know, different places and just as they came close to
 S, either that same lady from OSE or another one said, "Okay, we'll take her."
\par NL:\tab That is, keep you?
\par SS: \tab Keep me.  And I remember very--in a great hurry saying goodbye to my parents and them saying, "Don't worry.  We'll see you again," and, of course, th
at was the last time I saw them.  And I was taken by this lady into that place, and my memory is vague and yet very vivid, it's a very non-verbal...
\par NL:\tab Do you remember the feeling?
\par SS:\tab Yes, it's a very non-verbal going into that barrack and I--it's like I totally let loose and I ran away and they came and got me.
\par NL:\tab You tried to run out of the camp?
\par SS:\tab I tried to run back to my parents.
\par NL:\tab To your parents?
\par SS:\tab They were gone.  They were gone.  I wanted to go with them forever.  Right.  And I remember th
at the adults had to literally subdue me.  I just remember being totally out of it, out of my mind.  The closest, the next to closest that I can remember being totally out of control, crazy, I guess, more like a child having a tantrum.  But it wasn't a ch
ild-like tantrum, I mean it was...
\par NL:\tab The real thing.
\par SS:\tab I mean, it was horror, it was pain.  I remember, too, that my mother and I wore the same dress.  It's a print I will never forget.  It was a deep purple and there were little squares, little yellow 
lines, and she wore a dress like that and I wore the same dress.  I have a photo of her and me together somewhere wearing these same dresses, and just going around frantically the next day and every day after asking people, "Did you see a lady wearing thi
s dress?"
\par NL:\tab Had other children been separated from their parents, too, perhaps at this time?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, the barrack was full of children.  I have no idea of when and how.
\par NL:\tab Did anyone give you any comfort?
\par SS:\tab The thing that I learned was, after I was se
parated from my parents, that the reason, you know, remember clearly, I mean, I clearly, clearly remember because it was such an intense relief, such a weight off my shoulder, when this woman said there is no more room for a child, your child which, of co
u
rse, I now have since looked upon with utter bitterness.  You know, I don't even find words to describe it.  There is a goddamned wooden barrack and, of course, there is room for one more child, there is room for ten more, there is room for 100 more.  I m
ight say sadly that that was just the beginning of the kinds of experiences that I had with Jewish agencies.  I hate them.  I hated them.  I mean to this day I haven't contributed to a Jewish charity.  I will contribute to Israel.
\par NL:\tab Don't you know they have the same kind of agencies, some of the same kind of organizations there?
\par SS:\tab I know, totally irrational.  I'm sure that they did their goddamned best.  That was my experience.
\par NL:\tab Just one thing about this woman, about whom you feel so bitter and it's not...
\par SS:\tab Okay.  Just let me tell you the background.
\par NL:\tab Sure.
\par SS:\tab The background is, if you recall, there was a lady, let's give her a name, Paula, who was a distant relative of my mother's.  Her connection was married, you know, the daughter of, I can g
ive you the genealogy, but it is a distant cousin, who was also a friend, who had fled to France from Lithuania, and who was living in the City of Pau, and my mother used to see her and I remember seeing her.  I remember this lady from Aurich.  I remember
 
her visiting us in Rocquigny.  Paula's brother-in-law was a man named Dr. Olschwanger, who had gone to London, and he was sent, according to Paula, and I don't know if it is true, he was one of the founders of OSE.  He was a physician.  I haven't seen the
 name in writing, so I don't know.
\par NL:\tab Can you spell it for me?
\par SS:\tab O-L-S-C-H-W-A-N-G-E-R. Does that sound familiar to you?
\par NL:\tab I have never seen it.  No. It would be interesting
\par SS:\tab But, anyway, Paula found out that we were in Gurs and then Rivesalt
es, and Paula went and pulled all kinds of strings.  From Pau Paula by then was in Montpelier.  That's right, from Pau she went to Montpelier and in Montpelier, she found out we were in Rivesaltes.  Maybe my mother was able to send her a postcard some tim
e.  She pulled every conceivable string to get my parents [unclear].
\par NL:\tab I was wondering if that was in the Italian zone, but the Italian zone was closer.
\par SS:\tab No, at that time the Italian business was much later.  This was 1943.  I think, the Italians did not occupy till--this is '42.  I think, the Italian occupation was '43, wasn't it?
\par NL:\tab After the Normandy--after the North African landing, November, '42, early '43.  Yeah.
\par SS:\tab So, anyway, because then I found a note.
\par NL:\tab From her?
\par SS:\tab From her, you know, to that agency in the camp trying to--that she had written to my mother: "Dear Carla and dear Joseph, I am trying to get you and Sonja out," and that's how come I got out of the camp.
\par NL:\tab Through that letter.  But it came too late to save Mother and Father.
\par SS: \tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Or, perhaps, it wouldn't have helped.
\par SS:\tab Anyway, that isn't the point.
\par NL:\tab But that letter helped you.
\par SS:\tab That is not my focus.  My focus was really--my profound bitterness, or maybe guilt, a lot of guilt.
\par NL:\tab Of course.  Because you survived.
\par SS:\tab Because I survived.  Because somebody knew somebody.
\par NL:\tab The only point that I was going to make about the OSE woman was that she was, of course, behaving like a bureaucrat, thinking in terms of statistics, but also, I doubt very much if she kne
w what the destination of those transports was going to be.  It's not even clear, according to some sources, and this is...
\par SS:\tab Yeah, but I have a document here about my being released from Rivesaltes, which is on UGIF [}{\i\fs24 Union G\'e9n\'e9rate des Isra\'e9lites de France}{\fs24 
 French Jewish Council] paper, which gives the reasons for having liberated me from Rivesaltes, as }{\i\fs24 enfant abandon\'e9}{\fs24 , an abandoned child.  Which, of course, when I saw that, at the time...
\par NL:\tab It disturbed you to no end.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, my parents did not abandon me.
\par NL:\tab Maybe that was a way of satisfying the Vichy government.
\par SS:\tab I suppose.
\par NL:\tab It's hard to fathom all these things...
\par SS:\tab So, anyway, I...
\par NL:\tab They went to Drancy.  You heard nothing more from them.
\par SS:\tab Yes, I got a postcard from my mother from the train.
\par NL:\tab On the way to Drancy.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, which said, "Sonja, we are fine.  Everything is fine." And love, you know, kisses, whatever.
\par NL:\tab It's not clear from the evidence that even Vichy officials knew what t
he destination of the transports from Drancy were, certainly not in '42.  I'm not, of course, excusing this woman, but just saying that she may have, she may not have known what their destiny was to be.
\par SS:\tab Okay.  So...
\par NL:\tab It was an offensive thing to say, of course.
\par SS:\tab I guess not to say, to do.  It was the fact that if it hadn't been for Paula's pull, I would have gone with you.
\par NL:\tab Would have gone with them?
\par SS: \tab I'm sorry, I'm not being very ...
\par NL:\tab No, I--did you have any other encounters with Jewish Agency people while you were in the camps?
\par SS:\tab That's why I want to go on.  No, that was the only one.
\par NL:\tab That was the only one.
\par SS:\tab I remember that there was some Samson cousins who had come from Germany, who were in Rivesaltes, because I was sent to a 
different part of the camp and I spent a day or so, I saw them.  I think, it was in Gurs the first time, I think, I was--there was an infirmary.  I don't remember why I was there briefly, and in the bed my mother recognized a woman who had been a German m
o
vie star, Dita Barlow.  But, anyway, I got out of Rivesaltes in a truck with the other kids, and our first destination was, either in Montpellier, in Perpignon, which is this major city, in a convent.  And I spent a week in the convent.  And that was prob
ably the most unhappy time in my life.  I longed, I longed for the camp.
\par NL:\tab How do you account for that?
\par SS:\tab Ah...
\par NL:\tab Were they harsh to you?  At the convent?
\par SS:\tab I think, they did their best, but it was a convent.
\par NL:\tab You had to wear a cross?
\par SS:\tab No, the
re it was clear that we were Jewish kids, but, yeah, they were harsh.  I mean, they had the kids, their own kids who were punished wearing donkey hats, walking about, but I think it was--while the camp had all the barbed wires and everything, you could se
e the sky and there...
\par NL:\tab And you had your parents.
\par SS:\tab They were humans.  They were people in civilian clothes, and there it seemed like getting into a dungeon forever, that you would never get out of again.
\par NL:\tab They had black habits on?
\par SS: \tab Oh, sure.
\par NL:\tab Well, that's very frightening to a child, isn't it?
\par SS: \tab Yes, but you remember my experience in Luxembourg.  My grandfather had prepared me for it.  Living.  Remember when I went to the nursery school in Luxembourg, and he had prepared me.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab But that was the shock.  I think, it probably all piled up being in a strange place.
\par NL:\tab And...
\par SS:\tab Being removed.
\par NL:\tab Being removed from your parents.  That probably was overpowering.
\par SS:\tab Right, it was.  I got out of the convent and I got to a place called Palavas-les-Flots, which is a resort place on the Mediterranean, south of the city of Montpellier, and I think, I spent a couple of months there.
\par NL:\tab Was that in a convent?
\par SS:\tab No, no.  That was under the auspices of orphanages.  Under the auspices of UGIF and OSE.  It was all children.
\par NL:\tab What was your experience there?
\par SS:\tab And that was...
\par NL:\tab Was that a little happier?
\par SS:\tab That was close to Montpellier, where eventually Paula came and saw me and I rejoined her.
\par NL:\tab I see.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, my experience there was hungry, starving.
\par NL:\tab In the orphanage?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, and in the mornings, seeing cans of empty food that the bureaucrats of the agency...
\par NL:\tab Had eaten, but weren't sharing with you?
\par SS:\tab Right.  The only other memory I have of that, that was painful becau
se all the kids there shortly after I got out, they were rounded up and shipped off.  But there was a terrible storm one night, a terrible storm, I guess, a kind of tornado, like we have here, because I remember waking up in the morning, because I remembe
r waking up in the morning with bricks on me on the bed.
\par NL:\tab My word.
\par SS:\tab Looking at the sky and I apparently was the only one who slept through it all.  So, I think that's how I dealt with...
\par NL:\tab Unpleasant things.
\par SS:\tab Withdrawal.
\par NL:\tab Go to sleep.
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab Was there any schooling at the orphanage?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab How did you spend your time there, do you remember, any days that you recall, besides being hungry.  I guess, that was...
\par SS:\tab You know, these are the two, the only two images that I have.  You know, the roof having caved in literally and, you know, watching }{\i\fs24 yenim}{\fs24  [them, the others] eat.
\par NL.:\tab And you were there, you think, for a few months?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  According to this, it was--no, maybe not.  Yeah, it looks like maybe a month or a month and a half or something, not terribly long, two months...
\par NL:\tab And from there you were trucked again or...?
\par SS:\tab No, from there I joined Paula and her family.
\par NL:\tab She came for you.  Paula came for you?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, and I stayed with her in Montpellier.
\par NL:\tab And were there any children there?
\par SS:\tab Yes, she had my darling, her son, who was seven years younger than I and who, when we used to fight, used to delight and console himself with the notion that I, that he was seven years younger than I, and that meant I would die sev
en years before he would.
\par NL:\tab You would have discussions of that kind?  That's typical of children, too.  I remember thinking that about other children and about my mother, lamenting the fact that she was going to die much before I would.  So, that's very 
characteristic of children, I think.  Did you go to school while you were with Paula?
\par SS:\tab No, but look it's 5:20, and, well, I don't know what do you want.
\par NL:\tab Tell me a little about your life with Paula.  Did you go to school in Montpellier?
\par SS:\tab No.  Let's see, we weren't in Montpellier very long.  According to this, we were--no, November, I got to Montpellier and then we went to Vic-sur-C\'e9re, which is in central France [north of Montpellier].
\par NL:\tab She was moving, too?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes.  They, she and her husband, remember she is from Lithuania.
\par NL:\tab From Lithuania.  So, she, of course, was a foreigner.
\par SS:\tab Sure, and her husband, Leon, was from Poland.  I can't remember from where.  It doesn't matter.  Memel?  No, that Lithuania.  That was Paula.  He was from...
\par NL:\tab Anyhow, they were on the run.
\par SS:\tab They were on the run, so from Montpellier we went to central France and there we lived in a village, [might have meant to say "villa"] which we shared with another family by the name of Epstein.  And they had, the Epste
ins were a family of four.  They had a son and daughter and the son, Roland, in fact, was mentioned in a book that I read relatively recently.  He was also a member of the Underground and he smuggled children to Switzerland.
\par NL:\tab The, the Scouts, Eclaireurs?  Was he a member of the Eclaireurs?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.  I forget which book, relatively recently.
\par NL:\tab Do you know his last name?
\par SS: \tab Epstein.
\par NL:\tab Oh, Epstein.
\par SS:\tab Well, it was a book about the Jews in the French Underground, and he was 
mentioned in it.  Anyway, we lived with them and shared a house.  There was no food, you know, your question that my birthday present in 1943 was one egg.  That gives you an idea.
\par NL:\tab Were you getting any help at all from any of the farmers in the area?  Did they help you with...?
\par SS:\tab No, only, you know, you could buy stuff at a high price...
\par NL:\tab If you had money?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, yeah, [unclear].
\par NL:\tab And Paula and her husband were living off what?  Cash they got from selling goods, or did they still have some money?
\par SS:\tab Yeah he traff...

\par 
\par NL:\tab We are on Tape 3, Side 1, continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.  About trafficking in [unclear]...
\par SS:\tab And Vic-sur-C\'e9re, in this part, which is close to Aurillac, living with the Epsteins, there I 
remember going to school, and I remember walking some five kilometers to and from school.  I don't have much memory or recall about school.  But I mean, it was the usual, wherever I went to school, they had traveled a lot of ground that I had to catch up 
on.
\par NL:\tab You were always behind, of course, in your studies?
\par SS: \tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Do you remember having any trouble studying or did you have enough light or were you able to get books?
\par SS:\tab We used candles.
\par NL:\tab Candles.  Did any of the children give you any food, do you remember?
\par SS: \tab No.
\par NL:\tab Were they aware?
\par SS:\tab There was a source of food on the way to school, which was swell.  There was a factory there where they extracted the oil from walnuts, and they discarded this compressed walnut.  Tasted awful.
\par NL:\tab But you used to eat it?
\par SS:\tab Awful.  It leaves a terrible after-taste, but you could gorge yourself on the stuff and really get sick.
\par NL:\tab No vegetables in the fields that you could...?
\par SS: \tab No.
\par NL:\tab That you could swipe?
\par SS:\tab No. Also, it was winter to an extent.  Anyway, from there we went to Chamb\'e9
ry in Savoie, and I remember one attempt with Paula, Leon, and their son, who always was seven years younger than I, trying to get to Switzerland.  And I remember getting as far as 
the border, and I think that must have been the time when there was--when it switched from the Italians to the Germans, and the borders were closed and there was no way of getting to Switzerland.
\par NL:\tab It would have been October, '43?  The autumn of '43 Mussolini fell and the Italians were thrown out of the Riviera area.
\par SS:\tab Must have been around that time.
\par NL:\tab Winter, you said.  So, you couldn't get through?
\par SS:\tab Right.  So we went back to Chamb\'e9ry and in Chamb\'e9ry there was a school, a boarding school, which 
used to be, structurally, was an old convent from the 15th Century or so, ancient place, which was a public school, because, you know, by then I was 12 years old, the public school in--there were none for that age in the villages, so a lot of the farmers 
and peasants would send their kids to Chamb\'e9ry, the capital of the region, and Paula and her husband lived, and the son, lived in the town of Chamb\'e9ry in an apartment, and I stayed in the school, and the principal knew I was Jewish.
\par NL:\tab What was his attitude toward you?
\par SS:\tab Her.  It was a woman.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab Made like she didn't know.  But the assistant principal, I think, had some dealings with the Underground or something, so they were willing to hide a Jewish kid in the school.
\par NL:\tab You were the only one, as far as you knew?
\par SS:\tab As far as I knew, until one day, much towards the end of the war, there was another girl who sang, who had a nice voice.  In fact, she was said to have a voice, she sounded like popular French singer at the time, Charles Trenet.
\par NL:\tab Oh, I have some of his records.
\par SS:\tab And she sang "}{\i\fs24 Bei mir bist du schain}{\fs24 ."
\par NL:\tab For heaven's--in Yiddish!
\par SS:\tab Not in Yiddish, in French.  It was translated in French.  But there was something about the way she sang it, that a week later, I said to her, "Yo
u came from far, too, didn't you?" And she said, "Yes." That's the only time we ever talked.  It was very dangerous in that school, because a dormitory is not like an American school dormitory.  A dormitory there consisted of this huge dorm, I mean, a mas
sive thing with beds one close to the other, and you ate and you slept with each other all the time, and certainly a lot of the girls did--there was a lot of prying.  There was another, this was the }{\i\fs24 coll}{\i\f28\fs24 \'50}{\i\fs24 ge}{\fs24 
.  There was another school, a }{\i\fs24 lyc\'e9e}{\fs24 , in which seve
ral Jewish kids were reported to their parents by their classmates and were deported.  So, it was very dangerous, and I had to account for Paula, who came to visit me and I pretended she was my mother, but she had a different name because she was remarrie
d.  I mean, I just concocted a whole story.
\par NL:\tab You just fabricated a whole story?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes, I was very facile at that and never mixing up stories.  I just kept it straight.  So, it was in the boarding school that I really in part survived by hanging out
 with the more rebellious kind of kids, girls.  It was an all girls' school.  And engaged in mischief in the interest of, you know, "You are one of us," kind of thing, and that lessened the kind of questions, the probing, the questions.  I remember there 
was one girl who was particularly, "acting outside" we would call it today, by the name of Maxine.  And she was Protestant, and so we shared a lot in common because we were different, a Protestant in a totally Catholic country.
\par NL:\tab Were you expected to adhere to certain religious customs?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Say prayers and so on?
\par SS:\tab No, it was a public school.
\par NL:\tab But, of course, mostly Catholic.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, the kids were Catholic.
\par NL:\tab And were Paula and her husband also then required to falsify their identity?
\par SS: \tab Yes, in fact, I...
\par NL:\tab Make up stories...?
\par SS:\tab In fact, I helped them invent a false name.  I was good at that, also.  I had a lot of special skills!  Their last name was Slucki, Slutsky, in any other language.  In French it was Slucki, S-L-U-C-K-I, and I
 invented the name Slushard because they hadn't thought about it.  It's funny.  There are some things you remember with a great deal of vividness.  Because I felt that if they were arrested and the son, the boy was little, and if he slipped into Slucki, w
ell, Slucka is, Sluchard is hard for him to say.  Also, there is a Suchard chocolate.
\par NL:\tab Very clever.
\par SS:\tab So...
\par NL:\tab Were you furtive about your behavior, or had you overcome that fear, that apprehension about your identity, so that you could move freely among the children?
\par SS: \tab No, I was forever on guard.  Forever on guard.  I mean, including, with this girl Dora.  Later, we became friends.
\par NL:\tab The Protestant girl? 
\par SS: \tab No, the Jewish girl that sang "}{\i\fs24 Bei mir bist du schain}{\fs24 ."
\par NL:\tab Oh, the Jewish girl.
\par SS:\tab We never talked.  That was the only time we talked.
\par NL:\tab And that was a very brief conversation.
\par SS:\tab Very simple.  I said to her, "You are from very far away, too, aren't you?" And she said, "Yes," and that was it.  And she said, "Yes," and that...
\par NL:\tab That was it.  But, you got some food at this boarding school, finally, I gather.
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.  I remember every other day having noodles, pasta }{\i\fs24 vermicelles}{\fs24 , these little noodles, and you couldn't tell the noodles from the white worms.  They were thoroughly intermixed.  So we got meat as well.  [laughter]
\par NL:\tab Oh, my dear, my dear.  You didn't get sick from all this, I hope?
\par SS:\tab No, I was strong as a horse.  I didn't get sick until recently.
\par NL:\tab How long did you stay in the boarding school?
\par SS:\tab Well, about a year.  About a year.  Okay...
\par NL :\tab A long stay.
\par SS:\tab Well, you know, at that time, of course, at age 12, one year is a twelfth of your life, and at 50 is one-fiftieth of your life, so a year seemed long, endless, very long.
\par NL:\tab Very long.  Yes.
\par SS:\tab Things were very difficult in the school.  There were the usual furloughs, the weekends going home, vacations, and everybody had a place to go home to.  When you mentioned food, the French have a tradition called }{\i\fs24 go}{\i\f28\fs24 \'66}{
\i\fs24 ter}{\fs24  [snack], which is at four o'clock you eat something.  And, of course, since all of these were farm girls, they each had a little wooden box, with a lock, from home full with all kinds of goodies and, of course, I didn't have anything.

\par NL:\tab Did they share any of that?
\par SS:\tab Rarely, and when they did, I saved the food and brought it to Paula, for the kid, and didn't eat it.
\par NL:\tab You went home every weekend?
\par SS:\tab No, I could never sleep there.  I could only go there and visit.  You see, the whole idea of putting me in the boardin
g school was, in case their apartment would be raided, then they would only find three people instead of four.  This meant, of course, that during holidays and such times I was all by myself.
\par NL:\tab You stayed in the school?
\par SS:\tab In the school, which was, I mean, it still is, an enormous convent, medieval, with huge arches, ceilings, and I don't know, about 40 feet high, or whatever, and that was scary.
\par NL:\tab You were the only child left there?
\par SS:\tab Right, and there was the concierge, who was a seedy kind of a cha
racter, and there was a huge wall around it.  But the most dangerous part was oftentimes coming back to school at night, being followed by Germans, who were marching up and walking about the street.  
\par Talking about food, you know, we had, as you know, ther
e were ration cards for bread of which, of course, there was never enough, and I had found a bakery where there was a woman, saleswoman, who was very absentminded or whatever, so I'd always have the bread stamps in one hand and always--that was going on e
r
rands for Paula, and figured out a way of, you know, say, if it was 10 cents, have a dollar bill or whatever that required change, and of giving her the money, and while she counted and so on, and having, showing the money and the stamp, and while she was
 busy with the money, I'd hide the food stamp and get out that way without ever giving her the stamps and that's how we got our bread.
\par NL:\tab She would never ask for it?
\par SS:\tab I was able to distract her.  But also having it ready in case it dawned on her that sh
e didn't, hadn't collected the stamp, you know, "Oh, I'm sorry." It was at that same goddamned bakery that in back of me one day, two German soldiers looked at her in awe at her fingernails, which had dark red polish, and one saying to the other, "Oh, loo
k at her }{\i\fs24 Blut}{\fs24 " [blood] with relish.  And I swore I'd never wear make-up.  I'd never wear--okay.  What was difficult also was that Paula and Leon, by virtue of being hidden, they hid in a house, I mean, in an apartment in Chamb\'e9
ry on the second floor, but on
 the third floor, these were narrow round bat-like stairs, but upstairs lived a whore.  So, there was constant trampling, and it was terrifying, because you always heard the boots going up and, of course, it was the soldiers going up to the whore and you 
never knew, you know, the knock on the door.
\par NL:\tab Were they able to get out of the house at any time?
\par SS:\tab They didn't.  They didn't.  They relied on me to...
\par NL:\tab You brought food for them and messages, I guess, information, or whatever.
\par SS:\tab Well, they could 
sneak out a little here and there, but I'd take Ariel, their son, out, which was an ordeal, because we got along fine until we were close to getting near the house.  He really was a brat, and then he would let go of my hand and run upstairs and cry like I
 had done something terrible to him.  Yet, the whole time we were out, we would sing, we would harmonize or whatever.  I remember one time, walking home with Ariel.  Chamb\'e9
ry is a medieval town.  That's where the Duke of Savoie used to have their castle, wh
atever, and walking down one of these narrow streets, when all of a sudden I heard a bang and shooting and I saw a man falling dead.  I was walking with Ariel, and I just yanked him and went all the way around and we ran and made it.  Interestingly, this 
brat understood when things were for real.
\par NL:\tab He did?
\par SS:\tab Not a word.  Not a word.
\par NL:\tab Oh, interesting.
\par SS:\tab Anyway, that part was difficult, was the having to go back to that dorm at night, and always being chased or followed or whatever by Germans.  I was
 12 and I was developed early, secondary characteristics, breasts, and so on, so that part was very difficult.
\par NL:\tab Was there any adult there whom you liked, who liked you, who gave you any special attention?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab A teacher?
\par SS:\tab The only special, the only attention that I got was for being a good student.  You know, I always pulled that, and I got some attention for not being so good in gym.  You know, you had to do gym.
\par NL:\tab You had to do gym.
\par SS:\tab But, no...
\par NL:\tab And so, after a year, Paula and her husband and Ariel left this area?  What happened?  You said, you were at school for about a year.
\par SS:\tab Chamb\'e9ry got to be too hot a city for anybody, and so they found refuge in the mountains in Savoie in a castle owned by people who inherited the castle, and they hired out, he as a gardener and she as a cook.  And then in May...
\par NL:\tab And you, you went with them?
\par SS:\tab No, I stayed in the school.
\par NL:\tab You stayed in the school.
\par SS:\tab I stayed in the school.  Then, in May of 19--May 25, 1944, Chamb\'e9ry, the city was bombed and, well, alerts were too frequent; I mean, hardly was there a night that you slept through.  Most [unclear] there were alarms.  You see, Chamb\'e9
ry, as you know, was a strate
gically located city, because that was the crossroad between France and Italy.  That's where the main railroad was and that was the beginning of the main thoroughfare between the two countries.  So, I remember many times waking up when the rest of the gir
ls came back up from having been downstairs in the cave, in the shelter and I...
\par NL:\tab You slept through it.
\par SS:\tab I slept through it.  Or many times sleeping downstairs and mostly we slept standing up.  But on that day the city was bombed, and the city was bom
bed badly.  We knew it was the Americans who had done it because they had missed the main railroad depot. [laughter] The whole goddamn town was in flames.
\par NL:\tab Let me interrupt you just a minute, please.  Were you getting any news about the progress of the war during any of this time?
\par SS: \tab No, no.
\par NL:\tab Were any of the teachers sharing any of this with you?
\par SS:\tab No, no.
\par NL:\tab Singing "Mar\'e9chal, we love you."
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Did you have to express your loyalty to P\'e9tain?
\par SS:\tab Oh, sure.  In fact, there was an essay contest which I won. [laughter]  It was an essay contest sponsored by Vichy by Mar\'e9chal P\'e9
tain.  It had to do with something, write something about yourself, which I totally invented and illustrated and sent in, and I won the first prize.
\par NL:\tab How did you fabricate this new identity?  Do you remember how the story went?
\par SS:\tab I think, I have the story someplace.
\par NL:\tab But you had to express your loyalty?
\par SS:\tab No, not in it, but that was part, to just participate in this literary competition.  It was in itself an act of...
\par NL:\tab Did any Vichy dignitaries come to the school?
\par SS:\tab No, I think, they sent whatever it was, a book, a mention, you know, a shindig.
\par NL:\tab Was there any underground rebelliousness in the school, that is, a pro-Allied, anti-German feeling that you could detect?
\par SS:\tab None that I was aware of.  None and, believe me, I would have known.
\par NL:\tab Okay.
\par SS:\tab None, none, none.
\par NL:\tab Wasn't that the song "Mar\'e9chal, we love you"?
\par SS:\tab Mar\'e9chal, }{\i\fs24 nous vous..}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab This was the heart of Vichy land?  At least, this was the posture?
\par SS:\tab Right.  Anyway, the whole goddamn town is in flames.
\par NL:\tab Right.
\par SS:\tab And the Americans had done it again.  It was interesting.  By then we were able to recognize by the drone of the airplanes...
\par NL:\tab Which plane?
\par SS:\tab ...whether it was British or American.  I'm sure I couldn't do that today.  Also, the city for some reason, that was May, was depleted of water.  Maybe it was a drought.  I don't know.  I just remember walking through the city
 all in flames and the usual question: Where the hell do I go now?  Paula and Leon, as I said, were in hiding.
\par NL:\tab Did you hear from them through any route, any passage?
\par SS: \tab Well, sure enough, Leon came.  He was a good man.  He came and got me.
\par NL:\tab He came and got you.  After the bombardment?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  He came and got me.  He had heard the town was in flames and he came and got me and he told me that he had found a nice place for me.  That this was a place in Savoie, in the mountains close to where he and
 Paula were hiding, and that it was an }{\i\fs24 auberge}{\fs24 , which was kind of a }{\i\fs24 pension}{\fs24 
 kind of thing, and that the lady of the house needed an all-around maid.  And he had found me a place.  So, Leon and I take the bus and we get to the place.  You get off the bus an
d you walk and this is really isolated.  In the mountain, a little road goes up, and as we get to the top of the road, I see this woman who looked like a formidable lady, and as I got to know her, of course, this was her typical posture with her hands.

\par NL:\tab Hands on her hips?
\par SS:\tab Her hands on her hips.  You know, "What's this?"
\par NL:\tab No nonsense.
\par SS:\tab And looking and saying to Leon, "Is that }{\fs24\ul you}{\fs24  again, I told you I didn't want to ever see you again.  What the hell are you doing here?  Get away." And I don't kno
w what I said.  I must have said something, as she narrated it later.  She liked me right away.  She knew she couldn't stand him.  She knew she didn't want any part of him.  There was something about me that she liked and so in her grubby, gruff way, she 
said, "All right.  Leave her here and you get lost and I don't ever want to see you again."
\par NL:\tab And where did he go?
\par SS:\tab He went back to the castle where he was in hiding.  So, I am living now with this lady.  Her name is Frazie and her daughter, her daughter was about 20 years old, and this is '44; I'm 13.
\par NL:\tab 13?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I'm 13.  And the house itself was built also in medieval times.  The walls were made of stone, a meter and a half wide.  Frazie was a fascinating lady and that could take a whole hour to talk about her, where she came from...
\par NL:\tab She had tenants?  Or...
\par SS:\tab No, Frazie\endash I stayed, I was living there with her daughter, going into the fields, doing chores.  There was no water.  The well was a kilometer down, downhill, and you }{\i\fs24 shlepped}{\fs24  
every drop of water on your back.  You know, with a thing on your back and two pails on each hand.  And they had one on the head, on top.  They were good at that.  I couldn't do that.  But, anyway, I knew something strange was going on in this house, beca
u
se there were men that came and that went, and it took me two months, even though I slept in the same bedroom with Frazie and her daughter, Lucie, and we were together all the time and I spent a lot of time alone with Lucie.  It took me close to two month
s to figure out that it was the Underground.  I didn't know if it was the Underground or the French militia.  That was difficult.  But I tried.
\par NL:\tab What clues did you have?
\par SS:\tab "Oh, goddamn it, we haven't had meat in so long.  I guess, if it weren't for the Germans, maybe we might have meat," they would say.
\par NL:\tab Anti-German?
\par SS:\tab "Maybe we might have meat." "I am not anti-German, but if it weren't for the war or something," you know.
\par NL:\tab Indirect?
\par SS:\tab Oh, very, very indirect, totally...
\par NL:\tab These were young men?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab Who were coming and going?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, and no matter what, I mean, I was smart and clever and so were they.  The other part was Frazie's reason for not wanting anybody in the house.  This went on and on and on.
\par NL:\tab She knew you were Jewish?
\par SS:\tab No!
\par NL:\tab She didn't.
\par SS:\tab Oh, I invented a new story for Frazie.  It was after the war that I talked to Frazie.
\par NL:\tab What identity did you create for yourself, do you remember?
\par SS:\tab My parents got killed during the evacuation of France of Northern France.  My father had been in the army and I guess, [unclear], you know.
\par NL:\tab And you could be consistent?  You remembered it to tell...
\par SS:\tab As Frazie said after the war, it wasn't till after the war that I told her I was Jewish, it wasn't till a
fter the war that I told Paula, who was five kilometers away in the village, that this was the French Underground.  I mean I didn't trust Paula with that, and I didn't trust Frazie that I was Jewish.
\par NL:\tab Remarkable, the skills you developed for survival.
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab It is remarkable.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation, the first paper, on coping.
\par NL:\tab Coping--you knew how.
\par SS:\tab You know, that was before coping became a drugstore product.  But, anyway...
\par NL:\tab So, what were some of the other clues that you had that this was an Underground?
\par SS:\tab Just to stay with that one trend of thought.  Frazie said after the war, when I told her that I was Jewish, she was very, very hurt.
\par NL:\tab That you hadn't told her?
\par SS:\tab That I didn't trust her.  She said I did a good jo
b about my story.  But she said there was only one loophole that if it hadn't been that we were so busy and so involved with, you know, survival, and more than that, the whole business of the Underground business, that what she noted, the one discrepancy 
t
hat she noted--remember, this was 1944.  My story was that I last saw my parents in 1940.  And she felt that I had too much of a vivid recall.  She realized, when she thought about it, which she really didn't allow herself to do much either, that that par
t didn't jibe.  You know, a recall of two years versus four years.
\par NL:\tab Four years.  Interesting.  She was a very alert lady, too, obviously.
\par SS:\tab Very, very bright.
\par NL:\tab What was this Underground doing?
\par SS:\tab It was...
\par BL:\tab She had a star, a }{\i\fs24 Michelin}{\fs24  star, for her inn, before the war, with no running water.

\par SS:\tab To get any star in }{\i\fs24 Michelin}{\fs24  is good.
\par NL:\tab Oh, is that so?
\par SS:\tab You know, the number of one-stars in }{\i\fs24 Michelin}{\fs24 , a number.
\par NL:\tab Excuse me.
\par SS:\tab You know, the guide, the guide }{\i\fs24 Michelin}{\fs24 ?
\par NL:\tab The guide, yes.  I thought, three or four would make it an excellent...
\par SS:\tab Well, they only, they have one four-star, I think, in America.
\par NL:\tab Oh, so one-star is very good.
\par SS:\tab One star is in France.
\par NL:\tab Without running water.  Did she have good food?
\par SS:\tab Yes.  She was a superb cook.
\par NL:\tab So, you were fed there, I hope?
\par SS:\tab No, there was no food.
\par NL:\tab This was...
\par SS:\tab The star was pre-war.
\par NL:\tab So, the eating was no better here?
\par SS:\tab No, no, no.  Except that there, you know, she grew vegetables and stuff, but, again, all the food there really went to serve to the men.
\par NL:\tab What were they providing for the Underground? 
\par SS: \tab Oh.
\par NL:\tab Arms as well as food or hiding places for them?
\par SS:\tab No, basically, hers was a substation of the headquarters of the French Underground, the }{\i\fs24 Arm\'e9e Secr}{\i\f28\fs24 \'50}{\i\fs24 te}{\fs24 
.  The link there were, was that, like one of the men, Jacques, who later married the daughter, Lucie, he was a parachutist from London, and up in the mountains, arms, ammunitions, and so on were parachuted, and so, her house was a meeting ground, a }{

\par 
\par NL:\tab ...role of the underground at this home.  Were you privy to any of these activities?
\par SS:\tab Well, when I finally established myself with the daughter first...
\par NL:\tab Lucie?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  I knew that I had to get through Lucie.  And it was more that kind of strategy, more and more whatever current event was going on, to make a comment about it without acknowledging which side are you on.
\par NL:\tab You were able to walk the tightrope?
\par SS:\tab Right, and then, as I got to know Lucie better, and win her confidence, then I became a little more daring about making the kind
 of comment I made earlier about there being food if it weren't for the Germans, before, it would be: "It's rough that there is no food during the war."  That kind of thing.
\par NL:\tab That was the...
\par SS:\tab That was a gradual...
\par NL:\tab That was the extent of the shift?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.
\par NL:\tab For instance, to me, that seems to be an almost imperceptible thing, but it spelled a great deal to you.
\par SS:\tab And for her.  First you say, "It's rough, isn't it, there not being any food?"  And then, she would say, "}{\i\f28\fs24 \'41}{\i\fs24  la guerre, comme }{\i\f28\fs24 \'42}{\i\fs24  la guerre}{\fs24 ." [Expression meaning "War is war."]
\par NL:\tab So you went incrementally...
\par SS:\tab Right.  And then, went along with Lucie making more such observations.  Say, the only car you would see down the road, down the valley, you know, up from the mountains, whi
ch as I said was the main highway between France and Italy, and then to say, "By God!  A car!  I wonder if that's a police.  Maybe it is, police chief, I guess the French police, could be a French police.  Could be the Germans.  Could be the Germans.

\par NL:\tab To me...
\par SS:\tab Then, a week later, a month, you'd say, "Ah, Germans do have petrol.  We don't." This kind of thing.
\par NL:\tab Ah, that sort of differentiation.
\par SS:\tab Oh, sure.  Hey, your life is at stake.  You don't babble.
\par NL:\tab But for a 13-year old to have picked these techniques up, that's what's astounding.
\par SS:\tab I should think that was true of most young people who survived alone, you know, the way that I did.
\par NL:\tab Survival...
\par SS:\tab You know, you put your foot in your mouth and you have no more head.
\par NL:\tab And you learned that very quickly.
\par SS:\tab Sure.  Sure.
\par NL:\tab So, you began to, then, share some of these subtle things with Lucie.  How much time did you spend with her mother?  How much conversation did you have with her?
\par SS:\tab Not too much.  Frazie was a relatively gruff lady and very...
\par NL:\tab She was gardening and cooking?
\par SS:\tab Cooking and tending to stuff and, of course, as I later learned, dealing with the Underground.  But, you know, she is a peasant stock.
\par NL:\tab Peasant.
\par SS:\tab Frazie just died.  She was in her 80's.  She died last year.
\par NL:\tab Not much communication?
\par SS:\tab Well, after the war, yes.
\par NL:\tab But I mean at the time.
\par SS:\tab No. No.
\par NL:\tab How did you spend your days?
\par SS: \tab Work.  Work. [laughter]  Lady, you worked! I mean, there is no water, just the one that you }{\i\fs24 shlep}{\fs24  up.
\par NL:\tab Did you--were you able to get into town at all, or were you confined to the house?
\par SS:\tab There was no time for anything.  When I finally, when I finally made contact with Lucie, it was an enormous relief. You know, part of 
what I remember was really being most concerned about sleeping with these people.  My fear always was that I might talk in my sleep.  And for some reason I was quite terrified of that.  Apparently, fortunately, I never did.  But that was nightmarish.  Tha
t preoccupied me.  And I had adopted a style as much as now, I babble a lot and I talk a lot and so on.  I talked very little.  I talked very, very little.  And I never showed any feelings.
\par NL:\tab How hard that must have been for you as a child!
\par SS: \tab No. I gue
ss I am trying to differentiate.  When you--the places where you express sympathy are not places that hit me. In the same way, one day you said, "How was it about being in the camp after having been used to silk pillows and silk linens and so on?" Right? 
 Well, these are not the thoughts that come.  This is...
\par NL:\tab But at the time...
\par SS:\tab The thoughts at the time are very simple.  Being in the new place, being in the camp as opposed to someplace else, you know, each new place there's an intense sense of relie
f.  Once you get there, to size it up and to know where it is.  This is it.
\par NL:\tab To fit in.
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Not even that.
\par SS:\tab To know that you can exist.
\par NL:\tab To be.
\par SS:\tab 
You can exist there.  It's terrifying until you get there. To this day, when I travel--I went for a period in my life of really loving to travel.  I don't want to travel right now.  I still want to go back to Israel, visit Israel, but I've noticed when I 
t
ravel, even if I have reservations of a place, a hotel, even if it is in the United States, I am fidgety and restless and uncomfortable until I am not in the hotel, but in the room.  And I never eat breakfast, I never have, I mean, even as a child, all I 
remembered that I never ate breakfast, okay.  When I travel, I am miserable until I have my breakfast.  So, what I am trying to indicate is that the, the order of preoccupation, the concerns have nothing to do with what one thinks of...
\par NL:\tab Normatively.
\par SS:\tab 
Normatively or among Americans in particular. There's a sense of priority.  One of the senses is "This place is the best place.  The next one can only be worse."  So, however, much of a rat hole or a cesspool the present is, it's one that you know.  It's 
familiar. 
\par NL:\tab And you are alive.
\par SS:\tab And you are alive in it.  And it's endurable, and the terror is about the next one.
\par NL:\tab Psychologically, having repressed all those "normative" feelings, the need to share and to express your fears and anxieties...
\par SS:\tab I think, Americans have taught my colleagues, shrinks have taught that that is so important.  At that time it wasn't important, no. No, you only talk to people about real issues.  You know.
\par NL:\tab Survival.
\par SS:\tab For one suffered for others.  So, there wasn't you know, "I feel."  Who gives a damn how you feel.  It doesn't matter how you feel.
\par NL:\tab It's just--so very young.  That's what's so gripping, 12, 13 years old.  And coming out of a relatively spoiled, indulgent family.  That leap into a whole different world--that's...
\par SS:\tab Well, that's like, you know, we spent some time earlier, describing where I came from.  And I think that was true of my parents.  That while both came from great wealth and opulence, both were remarkably adaptive.  Never complained, you 
know, never bemoaned...
\par NL:\tab Very strong.
\par SS:\tab And, as I said, that was what impressed me so in the camps.
\par NL:\tab Could I, excuse me, go ahead.  Please.
\par SS:\tab Go ahead.
\par NL:\tab Could I impinge for just a moment on private feelings now? Do you remember grieving for Mother and Father at all?  After you got to Paula and after you got into the dormitory, or did you crush these feelings?
\par SS:\tab You know, the strange thing about that is I never, to this day, I don't think that I remember not grieving.
\par NL:\tab It was always there.
\par SS:\tab It still is.
\par NL:\tab It is still there.
\par SS:\tab It still is.  I think that in some major ways, I am a hopeless optimist about almost everything, and in an equally fundamental and major way, I am an extremely depressed, really depressed person.  And I don't thi
nk the grieving has ever ceased.  I think that the grieving never had anything formalized.  And I think that as a result, the notion--okay, that what made the grieving so difficult was the fact that until the day that I got those papers that we discussed 
e
arlier, with some arbitrary date saying my parents were killed in Auschwitz, the fantasy that they were alive was very strong.  It was lesser for my mother.  I always had a kind of fantasy that because she was ill, that probably she was spared much of the
 
nightmare and died because she was ill.  But I always had the fantasy that my father, being so strong and so adept and having the skills and trades of a peasant who could survive anyway, that maybe he had been liberated by the Russians and he was still al
ive.  The final realization that all of that was fantasy had nothing to do with some papers issued by some Nazis, Germans, but it really became concrete the day that I got on the boat in Sweden, in G\'f6
teborg, on the "Gripsholm", to come to the United States, and as I watched the distance between the land, Europe, and the water, the ocean getting wider and wider, that is when I really broke up.  And that's when I, for some reason, that was a finale.

\par NL:\tab The separation?
\par SS:\tab 
That was it, yeah.  But so, the problem was that, you know, people, when people kept coming back, not knowing, not knowing--I corresponded after the war with relatives in the United States, as much as I thought, badly as I told you, that's not--there is m
ore about Jewish agencies, I thought the most remarkable people in the world were the Chicago Post Office.
\par NL:\tab Strange.
\par SS:\tab After the war I addressed a letter to my cousin, his name, Chicago, Illinois.  And they delivered it!
\par NL:\tab Oh, that is remarkable.
\par SS:\tab I mean.
\par NL:\tab I don't think it could happen today.
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab The Post Office is much more efficient is those days.  Well, if you are not too tired, let's just take another few minutes for your experiences with the Underground, after you gained Lucie's con
fidence and you were able to indicate where your sympathies were.  Were you enlisted in some way?
\par SS:\tab Well, by, you know, once I was accepted as a member of the family, as someone who could be trusted, and that you couldn't--you weren't trusted until you h
ave proved yourself.  I mean, as much as the French are verbal and so on, it was a war.  And words didn't mean nothing.  It was deeds.  And once I demonstrated that I was dependable, then there was no more problem.  After the war, they said, all of them, 
t
hat is, Frazie, Lucie, and Jacques, who was a young man, that perhaps one of the things among others that they best remembered about me was my sense of humor.  That the most grotesque, horrible, miserable time, for some reason, I found something funny to 
s
ay, to put it in perspective, and to laugh, and I think that--you asked me how did I survive, and I think that was part of it.  Okay.  What my major part of the war contribution specific to the Underground was the delivery of messages.  As I indicated, be
c
ause Jacques, who had been parachuted from London, and there was another man, a captain, who was the commander-in-chief of the region, who often came there, they received, they knew the code of the information that was transmitted from London, which had t
o
 do with the delivery of ammunition and stuff, in the mountains.  So then, the object was to transmit the messages to the various smaller units along the way.  And the main method of locomotion, I am thinking of the 2,000-year-old man, you know, the story
 about the 2,000-year-old man, and when he was asked which kind of locomotion did you use in those days and he said, "Fear.  We ran like hell."  It was bicycles.
\par NL:\tab Bicycles.
\par SS:\tab And knowing the mountains, you know, climbing up.
\par NL:\tab You bicycled up those mountains?
\par SS:\tab Bicycling up the mountains and also going up to the mountains to the farmers to get eggs.  That was another, that was a neat trick, and I was not born and raised in the mountains.  The shoes we had were wooden soles.  And I am appalled by the
 current fad!  Goddamn America!  You know, these clunky wooden shoes.  We had no leather.  Try to climb mountains with these wooden cloppers, but, anyway, you did it mostly on your ass.  That is, you go all the way up to the mountains, which was a four or
 five hour walk.  Lucie showed me the way once.
\par NL:\tab Once?
\par SS:\tab Once.
\par NL:\tab And you had to master it?
\par SS:\tab Yes. 
\par BL:\tab And she showed you the way to get up a tree, too, but not the way to get down, and you figured that out yourself.
\par SS:\tab So, you know, getting some eggs from the peasants, carrying them in the basket, and the idea was to get back down and you didn't dare break an egg.
\par NL:\tab Of course not.
\par SS:\tab You didn't dare. So, that's why I said you ended up with a raw }{\i\fs24 tochis}{\fs24  from sliding down. But there wasn't a broken egg.
\par NL:\tab Did you meet any other young people who were involved in similar activities?
\par SS:\tab It was not a social club.
\par NL:\tab But, I mean, no other networks that you contacted.
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Because there was a very wide ranging network, and many...
\par SS:\tab 
Right, but I assumed that because this was the headquarters, it was very isolated, and it was important that it be so.  Anyways, how did we transport messages?  There were two methods.  Lucie happened to have a big mouth, and I don't mean it figuratively.
  I mean it literally, a big, oral cavity.  And in those days in France, aspirin containers were flat little things, sort of oval shaped, you know, that you pull apart and put together.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab It's hard to describe it verbally.  They were made out of 
tin or something.  And that's what aspirin came in. Because she had such a big mouth, the message was housed in that thing, and she hid it in her mouth and she had practiced how, if necessary, she could swallow it.
\par NL:\tab Swallow it?
\par SS:\tab Sure.  You didn't get
 caught with a message in your mouth.  Not having a big mouth and, in fact, having a very small mouth, I mean, oral cavity, I invented a method of carrying the messages, which is, you take, I put the message in a container like that and attached the conta
i
ner to a wire so.  On the container I made a hook like a nail bent around like that.  I also had a cork.  Anyway, take a cork, put a thing on it, put the message, remove the seat of the bicycle.  Sorry, I'm thinking in French now.  Remove the seat of the 
b
icycle, then you have this long bar, right?  Okay, put the message in there, top it with a cork, and the cork has a bent nail so that you can tip the bike upside down, shake it, it won't fall off.  But if you know about it you can go down there and retrie
v
e it and pull it up.  That's when also it was important for me not to know German, because one time, on one of these missions on a bridge, the Germans stopped me and wanted my bike, and they talked about me and I could understand what they said and that w
a
s the scary part.  The scary part was not just understanding what they said, but it was the fear that they would see that I could understand them, and to continue acting like I didn't understand them.  I was just a dumb peasant kid.  Since Frazie didn't k
n
ow that I was Jewish and Lucie didn't know, they decided, Frazie decided it was important that I, you know, be communion.  So, they understood about the war and all that and poor orphan, so I got private tutoring from the local priest, and with the local 
p
riest the difficult part was, I was supposed to be dumb, and, you know, all these terrible things that had happened, and I didn't know much about Catholicism.  And he was awed, oh, yes.  I have heard of Jesus and I knew the basic prayers.  So, I became a 
good Catholic.
\par NL:\tab Went to mass?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.
\par NL:\tab Communion?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes, the whole bit.  I still smell that holy water.
\par NL:\tab The incense, the holy water.
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab How long did you stay with Frazie?
\par SS:\tab Till the war ended.
\par NL:\tab And for this part of the country, when was liberation?
\par SS:\tab We liberated ourselves, actually, August 22 through 24, 1944.  Right.  The war formally ended in '45.
\par NL:\tab Paris was liberated, I think, in '44.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, right.  That's when we literally liberated ourselves.
\par NL:\tab What was the signal for liberation?  How did you know you were--the war was over?
\par SS:\tab The same Captain Blanchard came in a uniform in a car.
\par NL:\tab Revealed himself?
\par SS:\tab And said, "You can put up the flag." That was also the day that I caught the man whom I later learned was the butcher of Grenoble, which is a city.  Here is Chamb\'e9ry.  Okay.  And Frazie's house was like 40 kilometers from Chamb\'e9
ry up in the mountains.  Here is Grenoble.  And...
\par NL:\tab Do you remember his name?
\par SS:\tab No, I have thought about it and, you know, 
I could ask, I could write to Lucie and find out.  What happened on that day, as you asked, Blanchard came up in a car and again, that same top of the road, it was a dirt road, where Frazie's house was.  By the way, Frazie's first cousin lived, had a hous
e adjacent to her house, just separated by another little tiny road, but quite adjacent.  Until the end of the war he didn't know whether it was the French Underground or the }{\i\fs24 milice}{\fs24  [militia].
\par NL:\tab Extraordinary.
\par SS:\tab 
You know, and as I said, I saw Paula once in a while, but I was afraid.  I was afraid that if I let Paula know that I was in the Underground, and she ever got caught or her husband or her son, she'd sell out.  And likewise I was afraid that if I got caugh
t and Frazie and Lucie, that the price for harboring a Jew would be double, number one. Number two, they were quite anti-Semitic.
\par NL:\tab You picked that up?  It was obvious?
\par SS:\tab It wasn't hard.  I mean, all Jews have flat feet and long noses!
\par NL:\tab But they expressed this?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, they told jokes about it and they talked about Jews in that way, and when after the war, when I told them I was Jewish, the first comment was, "But you don't look it...
\par NL:\tab Or, you're not like the others.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, right.
\par BL:\tab A white Jew.  A wonderful phrase.  A white Jew.
\par NL:\tab So, then, your friend came up in a car and in uniform and announced that you could raise the flag.
\par SS:\tab Right.  And almost simultaneously or within minutes of his arrival, up the road came again, you know, we are 
standing at the house and here is the kitchen and you can look out and you can see what is coming up way down the road, what's coming up the road.  Because the Germans apparently had been finally very suspicious of the activities.  And we were slated to b
e...
\par NL:\tab Erased.
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah, so we did a timely job.  We did it before they got us.  But the documents they found afterwards there was no doubt about it, that the house had been cased and they were just...
\par NL:\tab And how long did you stay with Frazie after the war?
\par SS:\tab Well, then, after the war I went back to my famous boarding school and then we moved up, but you wanted to hear the story about the last day.
\par NL:\tab Yes, the last day.
\par SS:\tab The butcher of Grenoble.  So anyway, Blanchard came and there was, you know
, embracing and shaking of hands and celebration and all that.  When this man and this woman show up at the top of the road, you have to be Lucie or myself to be able to manage that road on the bike without getting off and walking.  It's steep.  They were
 pushing the bike and they looked dragged out, pretty }{\i\fs24 farshlept}{\fs24 
 and haggard, and the man said to Blanchard, that they had just left the Germans who had temporarily seized them, that they knew of important German documents that would be priceless to the Fren
ch in the Underground, and what he wanted was a pass to get across the Underground line to go and retrieve these papers.  And in the moment of the heat, celebration, Blanchard pulled out a pad of paper and was about to give it to them.  They were all busy
,
 I mean, they're French, and I watched and I didn't like these people and I didn't like what he was doing, and the best way to get to a Frenchman--I mean, I'm saying this because I remember that it was deliberate on my part, saying to Blanchard, the man a
l
so said that there were a lot of bikes down the road, and I said to Blanchard, "Look at this old rusted, rusty thing that I have been dragging for the work.  I'd like a new bicycle.  Why don't you instead of writing that thing to the man, why don't you le
t
 me go with him so I can get a bicycle."  That's the only way to appeal to a Frenchman.  They understand greed. [laughter] So, there was a chorus, "Oh, yes."  By the way, my name, in keeping with what I said earlier, the name I made up for Slucki for Such
a
rd, my name was Solange Sansont S-A-N-S-O-N-T, spelled in the French way.  So my initials remained the same, and Solange, I told him, you know, nobody ever called me Solange.  I was called always Sonnie.  Now, we are back to the same thing.  Again, I was 
afraid of slipping and, you know...
\par NL:\tab No, it's very clever.
\par SS:\tab So, the course then, was well of course, since I was entitled to my piece of celebration, of course, Sonnie should have a bike.  The Germans stole a lot of new bikes.  "Go with the man and ge
t a bike." And that is how, because I didn't trust him, this man and I embarked and we walked down the road and we walked and we walked and we didn't say anything.  Nothing.  And I took shortcuts, so that he couldn't find his way back.  And we get to the 
main road, along the river, the Is}{\f28\fs24 \'50}{\fs24 
re, which is a major river again, that connects between France and Italy.  And along that road, the road was littered, and I mean littered, with dead German soldiers.  Many of them were young, they were all ages.  And he g
ot very frightened.  It was a funny, strange feeling I had.  I didn't hate them.  I was no longer scared.
\par NL:\tab It was the chief difference.
\par SS:\tab That was it.  There was nothing.  I mean, how do you hate a corpse?
\par NL:\tab And the man walking with you?
\par SS:\tab He started shaking and probably got diarrhea. 
\par NL:\tab And what happened then?
\par SS:\tab I didn't say a word.  Remember I'm a kid.  Here's this man and I said to him looking around, I said, "Monsieur, did you see enough?"

\par NL:\tab Now, continuing my interview with Dr. Sonja Samson, of Princeton, this is Nora Levin interviewing on August 4, 1985.  All right, Sonja, if you will continue, please.
\par SS:\tab Okay.  As I recall, and I don't want to repeat myself, I left off at the place wh
ich involved a day in 1944, August 21 or 22 where, involving the butcher of Grenoble.  I don't remember the details of what I said last time.  As I recall, I left off at the place where this man came up the road with a woman.  They were pushing bicycles.

y, had stopped by.  His reason for having come was to simply tell us that it was okay to put up the French flag.  The man approached Blanchard and said that he wanted a permit to cross the lines because, by now, all the lines were overtaken by the French 
U
nderground, that he knew where the Germans had hidden a substantial number of documents and that he could retrieve them and bring them back to the Underground and that they would be of great interest.  Carried away by the enthusiasm of the day, the elatio
n
 that it was all over, that we had won at least in that part of France, Blanchard pulled out a piece of paper and was about to write this man a permit.  I didn't like the man and I didn't like the woman, and I barged in and I said that I had heard from ta
l
king to the man's wife briefly, that down the road there were many bicycles that the Germans had stolen and abandoned, and that I would like to go along with the man to get a bicycle.  Blanchard and the other people who were there thought, of course, I wa
s
 entitled to a bicycle.  I had used this old clunker before and, certainly, the least they could do for me was to let me have a bike.  So I said, "There's no need.  The guys know me.  There's no need for you to write such a permit.  I'll get through.  Don
't write him one."  So he pulled it back in.  And the only reason that the son of a bitch didn't get, you know, a piece of paper that would have let him--a pass, pass is the word.  Okay.  So, I...
\par NL:\tab How did he react?  When you interjected yourself that way?  Must have been furious.
\par SS:\tab Possibly.  He didn't show it; he looked very docile.  If he had expressed any such, he would certainly have aroused suspicion, so he just responded passively and didn't say anything.  So, it was decided that his wife, his so
-called wife, looked also disheveled and tired and I suggested maybe she could stay behind.  I didn't feel like struggling with two of them.
\par NL:\tab Were you at all frightened?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab At the prospect of going off with them?
\par SS:\tab No. No. It wasn't foolish, you know.  It really wasn't.
\par NL:\tab Well, you diverted him obviously from something quite nefarious.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, that was...
\par NL:\tab Very vital.  But, now that you are with him, how did you feel?
\par SS:\tab What was foremost in my mind was not personal safety.  It really 
never was, but really the damage that this man could do.  So we set off on foot.  He and I, and we walked, and I took all kinds of shortcuts to go down the mountain and get over to where the main road was.  I mentioned that before.  That's the major highw
ay between Chamb\'e9ry and Italy.  And it's Valley Is}{\f28\fs24 \'50}{\fs24 re, the major river and we walked and we walked and it was August, and August in Savoie can be and usually is sort of like here, extremely hot.
\par NL:\tab Was he menacing in any way?
\par SS:\tab No. He walked somewhat sto
oped and somewhat frightened.  And it was a very odd experience that he seemed throughout extremely docile.  There were still fire shots that could be heard in the distance and he was frightened and I assured him. [laughter] I kept saying, "Stick with me 
a
nd you'll be all right!" We walked, and we got to the major highway, and the highway was littered to the right, to the left, with hundreds and hundreds of bodies, of dead soldiers, German soldiers.  That was a very strange experience.  I hadn't seen many 
corpses before in my life.  I had seen some, but not many, and it was very odd.  It was very odd, the day before, these were the people pursuing us, these were the people who had frightened me.
\par NL:\tab Did you feel some elation or joy at seeing them?
\par SS:\tab That's
 what I am describing.  I felt relief, that it was over.  I felt pity.  Here were these yesterday, strong healthy men who were savages, because the night before and every night up in the mountains you could sit there in the Alps and as far as the eye coul
d
 see at night, you saw fire.  You know what they did.  They rounded all up the villagers, men, women and children, rounded them up in the center of the village and burned them.  And we found out afterwards that our town was next.  They had, they knew just
 
about with certainty what we were doing.  It was just a matter of one day or two.  So, it was kind of shocking.  I mean, that was yesterday and here it is today.  I have often been awed about the fact that I felt no hatred.  I didn't rejoice.  I felt, I d
on't know, I think partly numb, partly tormented, and...
\par NL:\tab Maybe even disbelieving?  That there could have been such change in one day in your life...
\par SS:\tab That, too, I think.
\par NL:\tab What was the reaction of this man through all of this?
\par SS:\tab I just looked at him and I said to him, "Have you seen enough?" And he said, "Yes." And he was shaking.  I mean, he was shaking like a leaf.  He was terrified.
\par NL:\tab The world had turned upside down for him, too.
\par SS:\tab He was terrified.  And you know, again yo
u could hear occasional shooting in the distance, and I said, "Come on, follow me.  We are going back." And we walked back and we never said a word.  I never asked about papers, documents, nothing.  By then I had figured it out.
\par NL:\tab Now, when you say "back," you meant back...
\par SS:\tab To the house.
\par NL:\tab To the house. Right. He followed?
\par SS:\tab To the house. He followed like a puppy. Now, once we got back, I called Frazie and I made it clear that I wanted to talk to her alone, quick.  I said, "Frazie, something is wr
ong with this guy.  Quick, did you check his bikes, did you check the luggage?"  She said, "No."  I said, "Do it."  We did and, of course, he had all kinds of ammunition and hand grenades and God knows what, all kinds of stuff.
\par NL:\tab Did he have any papers on him which she could check against?
\par SS:\tab I think that she simply called Blanchard and the others and they came and got them.
\par NL:\tab Arrested him?
\par SS:\tab Yes. And three days later, we found out that he was the butcher of Grenoble. You know, Barbie was the butcher of Lyon. This was the butcher of Grenoble. There's more to the story. I'm giving a very abbreviated version.
\par NL:\tab Was he ultimately tried in the French court, or did he also escape? Like Barbie did?
\par SS:\tab I think no. I think that...
\par NL:\tab What was his name, again?
\par SS:\tab I don't know. I don't remember. And when I was back there, I meant to ask the people there. Someday I'll ask.
\par NL:\tab But he was referred to as the "butcher of Grenoble."
\par SS:\tab Right.  Right.  See, what I learned, and as I've mentioned to you, the current work that I do, I work as a forensic psychologist, and I have found that experience repeated over and over and over again.
\par NL:\tab Which experience, Sonja?
\par SS:\tab Yesterday's...
\par NL:\tab Monsters?
\par SS:\tab Nightmares, monsters, sadist, bully, once caught, I mean, they fall apart.  Totally.
\par NL:\tab What are the dynamics involved here?  It's just that when they have power, they have murderous intentions?  Or can be murderous.  Once they lose their power, all their strength goes?
\par SS:\tab No, what takes over is utter self-pity and o
nly one thought: "What's going to happen to me?  What are they going to do to me?" Which is all too frequently mistaken by psychologists, by psychiatrists and by the court, as representing remorse.  And guilt.  It's not.  It's just whining self-pity.  But
 I learned it then, and it's infallible.  Interesting.
\par NL:\tab Now, what then did you do after this experience?  Do you remember?  It's August, '44.  Did you try to reach any possible living connections and contacts?  Or were you so numb that you just wanted to
 stay put for a while?  You were how old, at this point, by the way?
\par SS:\tab I was born January, 1931.  So I was 13.  No, to me the war was not officially over.  The end of the war had not, what is it?  The treaty had not been signed, and I didn't really trust it until--when was it, May?
\par NL:\tab May '45.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I didn't trust until that time.
\par NL:\tab Did you see any acts of retaliation against any French collaborators in this period?  Late '44.
\par SS:\tab Somehow, I don't know quite why nor how I personally did not.  
But I heard and I read and, you know, the same thing that has been known, which is, you know, the shaving of the women's heads, or women who had collaborated with the Germans.  It was...
\par NL:\tab You may have been isolated from that...
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  But it was also, you asked about the butcher of Lyon, of Grenoble, I mean, and I think that they killed him.
\par NL:\tab The French.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I think that the most expeditious justice was done on the spot.  I think that, to a large extent, they weren't taking chances and they just killed him.
\par NL:\tab So, you stayed on at the house for a while?
\par SS:\tab And I returned to Chamb\'e9ry to the boarding school.
\par NL:\tab To the boarding school?
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Were any of your former friends or contacts still alive there?
\par SS:\tab If you recall, there was one girl who had hidden in the school.
\par NL:\tab Right.
\par SS:\tab Who was Jewish.
\par NL:\tab Right.
\par SS:\tab That I knew of.
\par NL:\tab Right.
\par SS:\tab I didn't see her again, no.
\par NL:\tab You don't know what happened to her?
\par SS:\tab I saw her again when I went back to Europe in 1953.  I contacted her.
\par NL:\tab So, she did survive then?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, she did survive, and I think, her father survived or her mother.  One or the other came back.
\par NL:\tab What did you find at the boarding house then?  Were you welcomed back?  
\par SS:\tab At the boarding school?  It just continued like before.
\par NL:\tab Did you feel any special protectiveness or tenderness toward you?
\par SS:\tab I never acknowledged that I was Jewish.
\par NL:\tab Not even after...?
\par SS:\tab It wasn't over.  It wasn't over.
\par NL:\tab It wasn't over for you.  So, you then continued with your classes?
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Were you able to discipline yourself sufficiently to study again, or was it something of a relief to be able to do that, finally?  Do you remember?
\par SS:\tab I remember that, at that time, I think, toda
y we would call it acting out, but you see, at that time, nothing had really changed.  Food was still unavailable, and nothing had changed.  Except for the fact that there weren't any Germans right there in town, nothing had changed.  There was no sense t
hat the war had ended.  That only happened in May.
\par NL:\tab So, you were still hungry very often, then?
\par SS:\tab Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.
\par NL:\tab Were you able to get food in some other way, other than through school?  I think, I remember your saying you used to go, what, out to the country, out to the weeds, and forage.
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Did you have to do that?
\par SS:\tab After that, on extended weekends and vacation I would go back to Frazie.  That\rquote s the lady of the Underground.
\par NL:\tab Ah, yes, at the house.
\par SS:\tab Right, and some
times peasants would give me a piece of bread and so on.  But I did join girls who were, it's called "going over the wall." The boarding school, I described that earlier, was an old convent with huge walls, I guess, about 12 feet tall, that surrounded it 
like a fence.  And some of the girls had boyfriends and stuff that they climbed the wall and met.  I decided to go with them.  I was tired of being so good.
\par NL:\tab Scaled 12 foot walls?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab This would have to be at night, I suppose?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.  And on the other side we met boys, and I met up with a boy whose parents owned a vegetable stand.  So, in exchange for a kiss, I got two oranges, which I took back and brought to Paula for her kid, for the boy.
\par NL:\tab Both.  You didn't keep any for yourself?
\par SS:\tab No. No.
\par NL:\tab Were you able to get something for yourself?  You turned everything over...
\par SS:\tab No, but that isn't the end of the story.  Then, somehow, I guess, a neighbor or 
somebody who lived across the street--that's all I did.  I mean I just went out for the walk.  I don't know if I described, but life in that boarding school was quite hideous.  I did mention a bit, I say, I used to daydream being outside?
\par NL:\tab I think so.
\par SS:\tab I did describe that.  Okay.  So that was kind of fulfilling my daydream.  You know, the climbing over the wall and being outside.
\par NL:\tab And did you make some close friends among the students with whom you could daydream?
\par SS:\tab I did it alone.  No.
\par NL:\tab But, I mean, in your own life within this school, were there any friendships that were especially meaningful to you?
\par SS:\tab None.  No. It was all distant.  You know.  None.
\par NL:\tab So, you didn't even have that compensation?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Who were these other children?  Can you describe them a bit?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, they were--I guess that boarding school would be the equivalent of American high school.  In the villages, say, for example, the village in which I lived, when I was in the Underground with Frazie, the closest school
, grammar school, was five kilometers away.  I had mentioned to you, I think, when I lived in central France, in Vic-Sur-C}{\f28\fs24 \'50}{\fs24 
re, walking approximately five miles to and from school.  Those were the equivalent of our grade schools, but as far as the equivalent of high school, there weren't any except in the major cities.  I guess, the }{\i\fs24 pr\'e9fecture}{\fs24 
 was, which to be roughly translated, if one thinks of each French }{\i\fs24 d\'e9partement}{\fs24 , as equivalent to a state, it would be the capital.  Even though it's not analogous because they are not independent states.  But that's in, say, the }{
\i\fs24 pr\'e9fecture}{\fs24 , that is...
\par NL:\tab Major city.
\par SS:\tab The major city would have a high school.  Now, it was public school and the citizens of Chamb\'e9ry would send their kids to the day school.  The peasants would use the boarding school.  Is that clear?
\par NL:\tab So, it was not private at all?
\par SS:\tab Oh, no, public.  So that all the girls, to answer your question, of course, in France they did not have coeducational education, so all the girls were peasants.  
\par NL:\tab Peasant girls. 
\par SS:\tab Peasant girls, primitive, very superstitious, and all the rest of it.  We were caught.  The other girls had climbed that wall many times.  I did it once.  And we were caught.  We were caught and it became a big affair.  The town newspaper 
had, you know, "Nuns escape from the convent," and it was sort of a scandal.
\par NL:\tab You were punished?
\par SS:\tab Paula was called in, and Paula and the director of the school went through their tap dance of hurt.  "How could you do this to us?" I\rquote d done it to perso
nally to hurt them that kind of stuff. [laughter] "Of all people!  After all we have done for you.  We\rquote ve saved your life." Endless, endless nonsense.
\par NL:\tab Were you able to dismiss it, or were you badly hurt by that?
\par SS:\tab Well, I'll give you an example.  I h
ad kept a diary, and I have never in my life, to the best of my knowledge to this day, have ever been jealous or envious of anyone, ever.  Funny, that way.  But it was a goddamn well written diary.  I wrote well.  And sometimes I am jealous to know that t
hat thing no longer exists.   [unclear]
\par NL:\tab Someone took it or was it just lost?
\par SS:\tab Oh, because when they found out, they raided all my clothes and all my belongings and they found the diary even though I wrote not too explicitly.  But, nevertheless, I pou
red out how I felt about Paula, how I felt about the director and all the rest of it.  It was rather transparent.  So, after everybody had read it, when I got it back I just tore it up.
\par NL:\tab Oh, they did return it?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab But it had been despoiled?
\par SS:\tab It had been violated.  And I've much regretted that many times.
\par NL:\tab I can imagine.
\par SS:\tab Because I think it had a kind of vividness and so on.
\par NL:\tab Surely.  So contemporary with the events.
\par SS:\tab Right, right.
\par NL:\tab Adolescent's point of view.
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab How else did they punish you?
\par SS:\tab I was expelled.
\par NL:\tab You were expelled?
\par SS:\tab I was expelled and that meant living with Paula who was hysterical about what I had done.  It was also at that time on the day--well, I needed to have my tonsils removed, because 
I kept getting recurring throat infections, and this was done sitting up in a chair in a physician's office.  He sat there.  I sat here, and the nurse held a big tray and to this day when a dentist has to insert a needle way back I can re-feel it, I get t
his horrible.
\par NL:\tab No anesthesia?
\par SS:\tab No, nothing.  So not only that, but that bastard was elated at the size of my tonsils and insisted that I look at them.  He had never seen them that big.  So after that, I walked home.  And Paula had to take care of me a
nd, of course, our relationship was...
\par NL:\tab Damaged.
\par SS:\tab Very strained, to say the least.
\par NL:\tab You never could recover whatever it was that you had before?
\par SS:\tab I guess, maybe that wasn't...
\par NL:\tab There was not much to recover.
\par SS:\tab Probably.  Thus, I remember the day of the declaration of the end of the war.  I forget what day it was, June?
\par NL:\tab May 8th.
\par SS:\tab May 8. Okay, I'll accept that.  I remember walking through the streets in Chamb\'e9ry and people screaming and yelling and, you know, like the movies that you see about the end of the war.
\par NL:\tab And you?
\par SS:\tab First of all, I couldn't talk because I had my tonsils out.
\par NL:\tab You were still suffering?
\par SS:\tab And, secondly, I was just bewildered.
\par NL:\tab What now?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  It didn't mean anything.  It was like an intellectual concept.  That was some idea that had no genuine reality for me.
\par NL:\tab Were you thinking at all about your parents?
\par SS:\tab Never stopped.  Never stopped thinking about them.
\par NL:\tab Never stopped.
\par SS:\tab In fact...
\par NL:\tab Did you make inquiries in '44, '45 of anyone?
\par SS:\tab Well, let me just--I wrote the diary basically, the diary basically--I took photos basically, did all kinds of things for my parents to...
\par NL:\tab You took photos?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab You had a camera, then?
\par SS:\tab No, but, you know, when people took a picture and you\rquote d get one, you know, school pictures, you know, whatever.
\par NL:\tab And you saved them?
\par SS:\tab I saved them, right.
\par NL:\tab So, they would know what had happened to you?
\par SS:\tab Right, so that when you ask, did I think about my parents, I would say that on one level, I never thought about anything else.  You know, it was like an omnipresent kind of thing.
\par NL:\tab Did you ask about their possible whereabouts?  Any people?  Did you have any access to official agencies, government, municipal?
\par SS:\tab I think that...
\par NL:\tab Did you ask Paula, to--
\par SS:\tab Sure.
\par NL:\tab To intercede for you?
\par SS:\tab To let the organizations know where I was.
\par NL:\tab Which organizations?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.  I don't know.
\par NL:\tab She knew you were Jewish?
\par SS:\tab Paula?  Well, she was Jewish herself.
\par NL:\tab She was Jewish herself?
\par SS:\tab Remember, she was very distantly related to me. Very distantly.
\par NL:\tab So, she presumably contacted Jewish organizations?
\par SS: \tab Right.  One of the surprisingly painful experiences consisted 
of letters.  I think I mentioned to you when I spoke to you before, there was a family by the name of Epstein that we lived with for a time.  Roland, the son, was caught, smuggling children into Switzerland and I told you there was a woman, Latour, I thin
k is her name, who wrote a book on the French Underground.}{\fs24\super 3{\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0

\par }}}{\fs24 
\par NL:\tab Anny Latour?
\par SS:\tab Right, and she described Roland.  She mentioned him.  So Roland was deported but he was able, apparently, in the camps in Germany to pass for a Frenchman.  And, I think, that he faked being an Arab, which he could.  He had very black...
\par NL:\tab An Arab?
\par SS:\tab Well, to account for his circumcision.
\par NL:\tab How clever!  I've never heard of that.
\par SS:\tab Sure, how do you explain that you are circumcised if you are a man.  He had olive colored skin, you know.
\par NL:\tab So many other Jews did, too.  It's the first time I hear of that.
\par SS:\tab Yes, he was a clever man.
\par NL:\tab And the Germans believed him?
\par SS: \tab Apparently, because they treated him as a Frenchman.  I mean, not as a Jew.  All right.  So, Mrs. Epstein wrote me very moving letter...
\par NL:\tab She wrote this to Paula?
\par SS:\tab To me.
\par NL:\tab To you in care of Paula, or to you?  Your school?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  "Dear Sonja, Can't tell you how overjoyed we are and excited and jubilant."
\par NL:\tab This is '44?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  "Roland came back." And almost, a sort of P.S., "I hope you will hear from your parents, too."
\par NL:\tab One letter or did you get more?
\par SS:\tab One letter.
\par NL:\tab One letter.
\par SS:\tab Then I had a...
\par NL:\tab Did you write to them?
\par SS:\tab No. What was there to write?  I heard nothing.  They hadn't come back.
\par NL:\tab You didn't think, perhaps, the Epsteins might have heard something?
\par SS:\tab I was very arrogant and I figured that if my parents were alive, they would find me. 
\par NL:\tab They would find you?
\par SS:\tab I wrote to the places where we had lived together, to tell them that I was alive and if they heard from my parents.  I wrote to the family in America.  I wrote and let it be known to all the people that I felt my parents would contact.

\par 
\par NL:\tab This is side two continuing an interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.  
\par NL:\tab About the Jewish agencies.  You heard from none of the Jewish organizations?  No representative ever came to Paula's?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab And inquired about you?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Were there any local Jewish agencies?
\par SS:\tab No. This was May.  Shortly after that, P
aula and her family and I moved to a suburb of Paris.  They originally had lived in Paris.  And they did not return to Paris, so we lived in the suburb of Paris.  And you asked me, did I write, so I wrote.  I had written to these relatives in the United S
tates.  Remember, I told you about the Post Office which delivered a letter addressed to my cousin in Chicago.  No address.
\par NL:\tab No address.  That was all?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab No further communication.
\par SS:\tab They were wonderful in those years!  They don't think like that anymore.  I wrote a letter to Manfred Hoffman, Chicago, USA, and they got the letter.
\par NL:\tab They got the letter.  You must have been, you must have been so embittered by this total lack of care and concern about you?  Or did you feel already hardened by the world, and not expecting anything more?
\par SS:\tab No, I had never expected anything; I was simply, literally heartbroken from the day that I was separated from my parents and had no expectations of anyone else.  They were good people.
\par NL:\tab And you obviously thought then they might still be alive, or you hoped...?
\par SS:\tab As I learned more and as I got more of these "Dear Sonja" letters, so elated, so excited, \'93Our loved one came back.  P.S. I hope your pa
rents will, too," You know, I don't know, how to say?  I was pleased.  Obviously, people who wrote, wrote about people that I knew, that I liked, cared about.  As I heard more and more about what, about the camps in Germany, increasingly, I, at times, tri
e
d to prepare myself and console myself with the thought that my mother, as I had described, had been ill, and that perhaps she had perished en route and hadn't suffered in the camps.  But until the day that I got on the boat crossing the ocean, coming to 
t
he United States, I must say, I maintained the fantasy that my father had survived.  Maybe, he was freed by Russians, fantasy like that.  But on that day, as the distance between the Old World and the New increased, I think that's when I had to come to gr
ips with reality.
\par NL:\tab What was your life like with Paula in the suburban home outside of Paris?  Did you go back to school?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, I went to the school there, but the most important thing in my life then was that I had a friend, I had a--I am sorry, I di
smissed something because I was so focused when you asked a question, did I have any close friends in the boarding school?  I said, "No." I did have one, but she was a day student.  And she was a close friend, and her name was Fanny.  She was Jewish, she 
was a Polish Jew.  And I think that maybe the reason why did it slip me by, I think that Fanny was far more important to me than I was to her.  She had an extended family with many brothers and sisters and a father and mother.
\par NL:\tab Living in France?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, living in Chamb\'e9ry.
\par NL:\tab I see.  They were in hiding apparently.
\par SS:\tab They commuted between Chamb\'e9ry and Lyon, up and back, up and back.
\par NL:\tab And survived?
\par SS:\tab And survived.  I think, all of them, in fact.  The oldest brother was taken, was deported.  He su
rvived.  He came back.  Another brother was very active, I think.  I'm not sure if he was in the Underground.  I certainly know he was very active as a Zionist and he started--he was one of the people who started }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24 
 after the war in France.
\par NL:\tab Do you remember his last name?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes.  Szchulklaper.
\par NL:\tab Szchulklaper.
\par SS:\tab S-Z-C-H-U-L-K-L-A-P-E-R.
\par NL:\tab Your friend, was she identified as a Jewish girl at school?
\par SS:\tab No. No.
\par NL:\tab She, too, had to pass as a non-Jew?
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab And there was no suspicion about her identity, apparently?
\par SS:\tab No, in fact, it was interesting, she had a close friend who was non-Jewish, and they looked very alike.  Fanny was sort of a, the face was sort of high bone structures sort of, 
probably, almost Asiatic origin.  You know, many Jews have this--I suspect that that must have been her origin way back.
\par NL:\tab Did you admit to each other that you were Jewish?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab You did?
\par SS:\tab Yes.  And I spent a lot of time with her, but, then, as I said, her family commuted up and back between Chamb\'e9
ry and Lyon, so she was not in the boarding school, in the same school, I mean, but as a day student.  I could talk a lot about that, but let me focus on something else.  Her brother, through Fanny, th
ey went back to Lyon, and when I came to the suburb of Paris, we continued to write and that's how I got involved in }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24  through her, through her brother.
\par NL:\tab I see.
\par SS:\tab And there were kids my age who survived, I would say that a goodly number
 went into black market, into all kinds of stuff.  "Hustling" is what we call it today.  And I saw clearly that there were two possible choices available.  One was to hustle, which is what Leon did, by the way.  That's how financially so many survived the
 war.  He trafficked in gold and all kinds of stuff.  And the other was to be a Zionist.  That seemed to be my style.
\par NL:\tab Pure and decent, more hopeful.
\par SS:\tab Hopeful.  Constructive.  Building, rather than...
\par NL:\tab Building rather than negotiating.
\par SS:\tab Yeah, and so I became extremely active in }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab In the Paris movement, or...?
\par SS:\tab Paris.  Yes, yes.
\par NL:\tab You traveled to Paris?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab To meetings?
\par SS:\tab On weekends, yes.  From the suburbs to Paris the train was, I don't know, I can't remember, but maybe about 45 minutes, half an hour.
\par NL:\tab Encampments, or just meetings?
\par SS:\tab In summer, we had a summer camp, and in winter we had a winter camp.  And in between I went around the Jewish neighborhoods in Paris and recruited little }{\i\fs24 Shomrim}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab That must have been a more positive time of your life.
\par SS:\tab Well, the nightmare was when the time came, all my friends, Fanny and then the others, through }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 , were talking after 1945, 1947, made illegal }{\i\fs24 aliyah}{\fs24  [immigration to Palestine], and I was a traitor.
  That was the hardest thing.
\par NL:\tab They had to leave by way of Italy?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.  I came to the United States.
\par NL:\tab You separated yourself from them at that point?
\par SS:\tab Right.  And...
\par NL:\tab Were you pressured into going with them in anyway?
\par SS:\tab No, I wanted to.
\par NL:\tab You wanted to?
\par SS:\tab You asked me what was there, what involvement, what emotional tie.  That was it.  I really wanted to.  That was the only thing that had meaning to me.  But there is a part in me that always has been the old German }{\i\fs24 Vern\'fcnftigkeit}{
\fs24 .  Do you know what }{\i\fs24 Vern\'fcnftigkeit}{\fs24  is?
\par NL:\tab Responsibility?  Duty?  Doing the appropriate thing?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab The proper thing.
\par SS:\tab Yes.  It's interesting, you know...
\par NL:\tab Even after all you have been through.
\par SS:\tab In, in German you say to a child "}{\i\fs24 sei vern\'fcnftig}{\fs24 ," which means "be reasonable."
\par NL:\tab Oh.
\par SS:\tab Literally, I think.  But it's right what you said.  In French, you tell a child, "}{\i\fs24 Sois sage}{\fs24 ".  }{\i\fs24 Sage}{\fs24  comes from...
\par NL:\tab Wisdom.
\par SS:\tab }{\i\fs24 Sagesse}{\fs24 .  Wisdom, and in English, it's "be good."
\par NL:\tab Interesting.  You were the only one of the group that decided you just couldn't make that threshold of illegality.
\par SS:\tab No. No. Nothing to do, God forbid.  I had been illegal all these years.  No.
\par NL:\tab I'm stumbling here.
\par SS:\tab No. Okay.  Going to a }{\i\fs24 kibbutz}{\fs24 
, I understood its profound limitations.  Just remember, I had lived all those years on farms in villages; I knew farming inside out.  I also knew that what I really wanted to do was to get an education, become educated.  I knew that in France there was n
o way.  I had no papers.  I couldn't stay in France.  I was not a French citizen.  I was }{\i\fs24 apatride}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab Stateless.
\par SS:\tab Stateless, and you know, you can live in France for 582 years and not obtain French citizenship.  But even if I had, with whom and where wo
uld I have stayed.  There was nothing for me in France.  There was no place, there was nothing.  And so I thought, as I said, that was probably, that was undoubtedly the hardest decision of my life, which was that my plan was to come to America because I 
knew, I had read, that in America I could go, I could work and go to school, and my plan was to get a degree and then go to Israel, and I'd be much more useful and valuable to Israel.
\par NL:\tab You were afraid, in other words, that going with the }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24 
 group you would become involved in building a kibbutz, working on the farm, and thus you would be deprived of schooling?  You didn't think you could get any schooling in Palestine?
\par SS:\tab Right.  And at that time, it was realistic, wasn't it?
\par NL:\tab At that time it was, of course, still very primitive and...
\par SS:\tab It was 1947.
\par NL:\tab Were there any agents coming in from Palestine, from Jewish Palestine, to try to convince you to go, or was the movement itself in a momentum of leaving?  Did you have youth leaders?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yes, }{\i\fs24 shelichim}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab }{\i\fs24 Shelichim}{\fs24  did come.
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah.
\par NL:\tab And they weren't able to prevail on you, obviously?
\par SS:\tab I think, Nora, you don't quite get it.  I didn't talk very much about these things to anybody.  I mean, this was my private, my own struggle.
\par NL:\tab Your evaluation of things.  I see.  I thought once in }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24  you could begin to share lots of private things.
\par SS:\tab I did share, I did share my doubts and my struggle with Fanny.
\par NL:\tab With Fanny.
\par SS:\tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab Let's go back a bit because it
 would be interesting, I think, to hear what the movement meant to you while you were active between '45 and '47.  Did it divert you? [clicking in background] So, Sonja, could you speak a little more about some of the activities of the }{\i\fs24 
Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24  group?
\par SS:\tab Did I say that on tape about the fact that after the war, yes, I think I did, many people went, youth went into hustling and there was nothing for me in France.
\par NL:\tab Right, but once you found }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24 , after you were in it for two years, very impressionable and important years, what did those experiences give to you?
\par SS:\tab Give me a sense that there is life beyond destruction, that there is something that can be built, that there is something to look forward to, that there are ideals that are b
igger than the individual.  I became an atheist, I think, after I got out of the camp.  If you recall, I had said, I think, had mentioned earlier that my father was a very Orthodox man and felt that he didn't want to hide because he had done no wrong, and
 God knew this.  And I became very literal about it.  If that's what happens, then God is wrong.  There is no God.  The hell with that.  What }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 
 did was give me something that was a kind of faith, an organized system of beliefs.  Even though, as you know }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24  is...
\par NL:\tab Left wing.
\par SS:\tab Left wing.
\par NL:\tab Secular.
\par SS:\tab Secular, and it made it possible for me to integrate being a Jew and building.  Does that answer...?
\par NL:\tab Also, I wonder if you could help also to analyze your own feelings of Jewishness. Obviously, you had had to conceal your identity for many years.  Did you not at some time before you joined }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24 
, feel negatively about being a Jew, since Jews were suffering and you as a Jew were caused to suffer?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab You never did?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Ah, that's interesting.
\par SS:\tab No. I never denied to myself that I was Jewish.
\par NL:\tab Not so much deny it, but...
\par SS:\tab God, I wish I had been born something else?
\par NL:\tab Yeah.
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Or that you didn't want to face the world as a Jew after all the suffering, nothing like that?
\par SS:\tab No, it never occurred to me.
\par NL:\tab Had you heard much about, or anything about the Zionist movement during the war, any echoes of the struggle to establish a Jewish homeland?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab That is, not until you came to this movement outside Paris?
\par SS:\tab Right.  Right.
\par NL:\tab Do you remember the first encounter you had?
\par SS:\tab No, as I showed you that picture of the first meeting, clandestine in 1943, all I have got is that photo and I have no idea.
\par NL:\tab Where it was.
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab It must have been well outside of Paris?  Just before you moved.
\par SS:\tab I have to look up on the map where it was.
\par NL:\tab And then your friend Fanny was with you in the movement in and outside of Paris?  So, you had meetings and you had encampments and singing and dancing, I suppose?
\par SS:\tab And seminars, and they were extremely important.  It is through }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24  that I met another friend that I really liked.  Fanny and her family returned to Lyon, and the
y lived in Lyon.  We only met when we had annual or semi-annual meetings.  The rest of the time, then, I was with the Parisian area }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 
.  I met a friend there, also.  Her name just fell out of my head.  Regina.  Regina was a student.  Regina lived in one of these typical in-the-ghetto dwellings.
\par NL:\tab In Paris?
\par SS:\tab In Paris, which was a barren room, no plaster, just rough stone.  Humid, damp, roof leaking, and so on.
\par NL:\tab She was a Parisian Jew?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab She originally came from Eastern Europe?
\par SS:\tab Fr
om Paris.  But she was going to the university.  And she took extensive notes from the lectures, and one of the things that I loved doing in the evening--I often spent weekends with her--I would stay up all night and read her notes on philosophy and loved
 it.
\par NL:\tab From the university?
\par SS:\tab Yes.  Her notes.
\par NL:\tab Marvelous.
\par SS:\tab And loved it.  Regina was older, I was 15 or 16, she was 18, 19.  And that earlier I said, you know, my major reason for coming to the United States was to go to school.  That just 
knocked me out.  That knocked me out, you know.  All these notes.  Well, of course, I didn't know it then.  I understood that much later, but from }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 
 I learned all these wonderful things.  I learned about Marxism, I learned about, you know, different
 theories and ways of putting the world together.  I learned about sexuality.  I learned about Freud, I learned about masturbation, I learned everything.  I mean, it was wonderful. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab A liberal education.  The members were survivor children, for the most part, or did some of them have parents in France at the time?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah, it was everybody, you know.
\par NL,\tab A mixture.
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab And what was the impact of the }{\i\fs24 shlichim}{\fs24  who came, the emissaries from Palestine?  Was that a thrilling encounter for you to hear from someone who was actually on the land?  Or were these French Jews essentially?
\par SS:\tab No, I don't think they were, they--I don't know; some, I think, may have been }{\i\fs24 sabras}{\fs24  [native to then Palestine].  I don't remember.
\par NL:\tab Do you want to speak a little about your feelings about a }{\i\fs24 kibbutz}{\fs24 , whether that attracted you, theoretically?  Could you see yourself as part of it?
\par SS:\tab As I said, theoretically, it attracted me.  Emotionally, it knocked me out.  I mean, I loved it.  The whole idea, of all
 Jews, all people like myself, all my age, we had survived this nightmare.  Again, this looking forward to building.  And, I think, the first time, a sense of superiority.  And I remember wearing...
\par NL:\tab You felt this was a Jewish concept?  Is that what you mean?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.  I mean, it was just so elevating, so exhilarating, that wearing the }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 
 uniform which was basically, you know, those workers' blue shirts.  Maybe that's why I still like blue.  I love blue.  [laughter] I remember, I think in 
today's parlance one would call it "being on a high." And it was a high.  I remember doing dumb things like when I took the Metro in Paris, I remember an old lady }{\i\fs24 shlepping}{\fs24  some bags, or whatever, "Let me help you, }{\i\fs24 madame}{
\fs24 ." You know, taking her bags and helping and doing.  It was that kind of thing.
\par NL:\tab High ethical concepts.  And these people lived by them, it seems.
\par SS:\tab And it was great.  It was very, very exciting.
\par NL:\tab Did you meet with other units of }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24 ?  Did you have a sense that it was large movement behind you, or...
\par SS:\tab No, as you saw the different--I always say "No" when I mean "Yes."  It's okay.  You saw the photo of the }{\i\fs24 machane}{\fs24  [encampment] in Jura which brought together all }{\i\fs24 shomrim}{\fs24  from all over France.
\par NL:\tab Oh, it was not just the regional conference, it was...
\par SS:\tab How many kids do you think survived?
\par NL:\tab Well, we know that Youth Aliyah took many, many thousands of children from all over Europe to Palestine.
\par SS:\tab We are talking France.
\par NL:\tab France obviously had, of course, there were other youth movements.
\par SS:\tab That's right.
\par NL:\tab So, quantitatively, there were perhaps many more.
\par SS:\tab I'm sorry...
\par NL:\tab Did you have growing reservations about the ultimate decision to go to Palestine?  Or did it, did the decision not to stay with the group com
e rather suddenly, when the other kids had to make the decision to leave illegally?  Do you remember that process?
\par SS:\tab I was fearless, I think you got that. I was not recklessly endangering myself ever during the war or endangering anybody else.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab You know that's what we talked about earlier.  About not letting Peter or Paul know that I was Jewish or the others know.  I was in the Underground now.  I was never afraid, so going on }{\i\fs24 aliyah}{\fs24 
, you know, didn't bother me.  That wasn't the issue.
\par NL:\tab Excuse me.  Maybe I didn't phrase the question.  You ultimately decided to go to the United States, as you said.
\par SS:\tab For the stated reason.
\par NL:\tab For educational opportunity.
\par SS:\tab Purely, and I was sure that once I obtained my degree, I would go to Israel.
\par NL:\tab You would return, or you would go to Israel.
\par SS:\tab Sure.  Yes.  It was a temporary--in my mind very much...
\par NL:\tab This was a means to an end, going to America.
\par SS:\tab Exactly.  I felt very much that I would be vastly more useful to Israel if I had an education.
\par NL:\tab And did you discuss this intermediate plan with the other folks in the movement?
\par SS:\tab Only with one friend.  I think, probably Regina, maybe two or three friends.
\par NL:\tab And the other point in my question was: Did the group decide to leave for Palestine illegally suddenly, or was this a growing decision-making process?
\par SS:\tab It was a growing.  I think Fanny went to Israel a year later.  We corresponded.  I corresponded regularly with Fanny from, well, always in fact, because she had commuted, first between Lyon and Chamb\'e9
ry and then, when I lived in the suburb of Paris.  I saw her again 1954 in Israel.  It was an anguished reunion.  It was pretty horrible for me.  But up until then...
\par NL:\tab She hadn't forgiven you for not coming, is that...?
\par SS:\tab In part.  The tim
ing was atrocious.  She gave birth to her first child, which was a terrible time.  I went with my husband, who was a snotty American Jew.  They certainly didn't hit it off.  And I was an outsider.  I was American.  I was all the things that they disliked.

\par NL:\tab They had turned their backs on the diaspora.
\par SS:\tab Right, and up until then Fanny and I corresponded very, very regularly and shared our torment.  She was tormented about leaving France, going to Israel and, I think, that probably most people, most, I do
n't know what to call them, kids, we were kids.  It also meant that after having survived the war, it meant turning your back on your parents for them.  It was hard for the parents, it was hard for them, it was hard for everybody.  There were many doubts.
  It was agony.  But, to me, the agony was, of course, of a different order.  I was a traitor and, additionally, I...
\par NL:\tab Did they, in so many words, condemn you?
\par SS:\tab Oh, yeah, oh, yes.
\par NL:\tab Sonja?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab The whole group left as a group?
\par SS:\tab No. Fanny, for example, went to Gvulot [alternate spelling: Gevulot] which is in the Negev.  She married a man, a boy, then from Belgium.  They were in various camps, }{\i\fs24 kibbutzim}{\fs24 , you know.
\par NL:\tab But their departure from France...
\par SS:\tab Was not }{\i\fs24 en masse}{\fs24 .

\par 
\par NL:\tab Tape 5, Side 1, continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.  
\par NL:\tab So they left in the middle of 1947 and...
\par SS:\tab Uli was the first one that I knew who left.  He was a survivor.  He was the young man who played harmonica so beautifully, and by watching him I taught myself.
\par NL:\tab Really?
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  Uli made a wrong turn when he got off the boat in Haifa and the Arabs assassinated him.  I left France to come to America in April, '47.
\par NL:\tab Excuse me. Sonja.  Can we backtrack a little bit.  You were living all this time with Paula?
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab And going on weekend encampments and so on.
\par SS:\tab No, weekend to Paris mostly, to deal with the young kids, recruiting.
\par NL:\tab Recruiting.
\par SS:\tab And training them.
\par NL:\tab May I ask, was she in effect still supporting you then, or was she getting some help from a Jewish agency?
\par SS:\tab I don't know.
\par NL:\tab To support you.
\par SS:\tab I don't know.  I don't think so.  I really don't think so.  I don't know, Nora.  You know more about that than I, but, I didn't know anybody who got help from the Jewish agency.  Let me tell you, I want to finish about }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{
\fs24 .  I don't like all these loose threads.
\par NL:\tab Yes.
\par SS:\tab One of the things that happened when I came to Israel and talked to the }{\i\fs24 chaverim}{\fs24 
 [buddies, comrades] that was startling to me was--I must say that I went to Israel and France, after having been in the United States in 1953 because I wanted two things before I could go.  Number one, I wanted to have the American citizenship, and 
number two, I wanted to finish college.  So in 1952, I obtained my BA and my citizenship, and then I started working and saving money for the trip.  So I went in 1953.  Very orderly.  Then, I had thought and rethought this whole issue of Marxism.  And I w
as especially appalled by the arguments and by the reasoning and by the thinking and, you know, I had a BA in 1952.
\par NL:\tab This thinking of the }{\i\fs24 Hashomer Hatzair}{\fs24  people and their identification with the Soviet Union?
\par SS:\tab In part, but also the level of argument.
  Biology was not my major, but I knew a lot of biology.  In 1952 we still had an education when we graduated.  And they were, you know, arguing everything, biology, history, genetics, whatever, from the Marxist point of view, and I knew that that was una
cceptable.  I mean, it defied all empirical evidence, etc., etc.  So it was very difficult.  So, it wasn't just what I started about, having a sarcastic, snotty American Jewish boy for a husband but in addition...
\par NL:\tab Your own development.
\par SS:\tab My own development.  I had totally outgrown that kind of thinking.  And I saw what it lead.  For example, on one }{\i\fs24 kibbutz}{\fs24 , we stayed in Gvulot, in the Negev, and they were planting onions.  So I worked in the }{\i\fs24 kibbutz}{
\fs24  and it was the way, the attitude.  It was a fanatic way of planting onions.  People lined up in different rows racing with each other and on and on and...
\par NL:\tab Seemed regimented to you?  And doctrinaire?
\par SS:\tab And fallacious.  I had lived in farms for a good part of my youth and childhood and I knew--and I had 
done hard farm labor, that you develop a rhythm, like, when you work in a factory.  That's how I put myself through college in the United States, by working in factories.  And I was working on piecework, you know, making tools and steel drills and so on a
nd I was making good money, piecework, but you develop a rhythm.  There was no rhythm.  It was all running, competition, and so on and so, that what you said, that attitude permeated and...
\par NL:\tab It was against your grain?
\par SS:\tab Right.  It was a travesty of what I felt farm labor was about and it was harsh on my part, I suppose, to think that way, but...
\par NL:\tab Well, but you had undergone a considerable personal development and it was inevitable.  Also, I imagine their rationalization about what was happening in th
e Soviet Union may have troubled you, too.  They were very defensive about the Soviet Union.
\par SS:\tab It troubled me a lot.  Right.  Right.
\par NL:\tab For a very long time.
\par SS:\tab You see, it was interesting, 1954 was the height of McCarthyism.  When I went on that trip,
 I was looking for a place other than America.  I was turned off by the McCarthyism in the United States, and my husband and I were certain that if we found a place we would stay.
\par NL:\tab He was interested in the possibility of settling in Israel?
\par SS:\tab He was interested in the possibility of resettling anywhere.  And I found myself endlessly defending America.
\par NL:\tab In Israel?
\par SS:\tab In Israel, and I remember, I mean, that's when I first had this sense of democracy in the most profoundest of ways, and I remember endl
essly explaining to them that McCarthy was a senator who was elected in Wisconsin and that it wasn't all America, and that, yes, yes, people like that, if they get enough votes, they can express themselves and some of it, it was wrong, etc.  But I defende
d the principles, the system, and I found that as I traveled through Europe and Israel, increasingly defending America.  That's when I got a real sense of America.  I really love that country.  It was interesting. [machine off and then on]
\par NL:\tab So you were t
hen moving in the direction of coming to America, Sonja, and may I just ask this one other question about your relationship with Paula.  Was it getting harder and harder for you to be with her?  Was she resentful of having to care for you or being respons
ible?  Do you remember any of that?
\par SS:\tab Her husband, Leon, was always extremely decent towards me.  If it hadn't been for Leon, I would not have been able to go to Paris to }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 .  He gave me the money to go.  I mean, it was trainfare and nothing else.
\par NL:\tab Sure.
\par SS:\tab But, yes, Leon was a very decent man to me.  Paula retrieved her relatives.  She had an uncle, her mother's brother, who lived in Belgium, by the name of Kubovitz, and I think, his brother was one of the early Israeli ambassadors.
\par NL:\tab It's Kubovitzky.
\par SS:\tab You're right.
\par NL:\tab A very important Zionist.
\par SS:\tab Yeah.
\par NL:\tab Leon Kubovitzky.  I knew him.
\par SS:\tab Well, that was Paula's uncle.
\par NL:\tab Strange.
\par SS:\tab That's funny.  How you dig up these names out of nowhere!  I haven't thought about that in forty years. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab So she was feeling what, better disposed toward you then?
\par SS:\tab No, she had found her }{\i\fs24 mishpocha}{\fs24  and she would pack up "mine darling", her son, and go for prolonged extended visits and just commute between Belgium and France.
\par NL:\tab So you were taking care of yourself?
\par SS:\tab And Leon.  I mean, I remember, in Montgerou [11 mi. SSE of Paris], which was the name of that suburb, there was, of course, no hot water.  And there was no Kleenex, there were no disposable anything.  And I remember some 
of the horrors of living involved the day that you had to wash handkerchiefs and you had--and I have always had a very hypersensitive gag reflex,  and as I was half gagging and choking washing these handkerchiefs in a bucket with all--I get sick when I th
ink about it, with the mucus and all, and like that.  That reminds me: One of the worst things about living with }{\i\fs24 goyim}{\fs24 
.  This was, I was taking care of Leon myself.  With the handkerchiefs.  I don't know if I mentioned it; if I did, stop me, but living with }{\i\fs24 goyim}{\fs24  in Frazie's house, I remember there was no running water and we had to }{\i\fs24 shlep}{
\fs24  the water, every God blessed drop of it, from the--about half a kilometer uphill.  The source, the well, was way down at the bottom of the mountain.  You carried it one buc
ket in each hand and one strapped to your back, and I got by with that because I was a kid and I wasn't a native, but they, in addition, had one bucket on top of their head.  That's why they walked so straight.  I remember one day Lucie and I went down th
ere and did the laundry, washed the linen, out of this cold water from the well, and then }{\i\fs24 shlepping}{\fs24 
 back up, and I don't know what happened.  I must have said something funny and Lucie started laughing, and she tripped and she fell with the bucket with all 
the linens that had just been washed, and we were almost uphill, and we had to collect all the stuff, go back down and redo it.  Anyway, the...
\par NL:\tab So, you were helping to keep house for Leon then?
\par SS:\tab Yes.  I am going back to Frazie now.
\par NL:\tab I understand.
\par SS:\tab But I want to go back to Frazie because of the }{\i\fs24 goyim}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab Oh, excuse me, yes.
\par SS:\tab Okay.  One of the things that, no matter how things were and how horrible and how awful and so on, I could tolerate almost everything.  One thing that I really could not
 stomach, literally, was the fact that in those days, again, there were no disposables, but what did women do for menstrual hygiene?  You had a rag, which was used, and then when the rag was dirty, it was soaked in a bucket of water.  And the same }{
\i\fs24 tepel}{\fs24  [pot] that was used for cooking is where the menstrual rag would soak.  I mean, you would rinse it out a bit, and you know, coming from a kosher household, that was rough.
\par NL:\tab Oh, my!
\par SS:\tab The other thing that was rough was when it was cold in winter, how did you bathe?  Well, there was, you know, Americans who collect these porcelain, what do you call these things?  For washing bowls? [speaking in background]
\par NL:\tab Sink.  Tubs.
\par SS:\tab No, no they are portable.  Porcelain bowls that are portable, that you pour water in.
\par NL:\tab I don't know what the technical name is.
\par SS:\tab You see them in antique stores.
\par NL:\tab Right, basins.
\par SS:\tab Basins, yes.  Right.  Okay.  So water would be heated on the stove which was, of course, a wood-burning stove, and I see nothing romantic about wood-burning stove, it's a pain; it's a }{\i\fs24 shlep}{\fs24 
; it's a misery.  So the warm water would be poured in the basin and Frazie got first turn and she would wash, and then Lucie, her daughter, would w
ash from head to foot in the same water, the same basin and, of course, since I was the low man on the totem pole.  I would be third [laughter].  Remember, I was born and raised in bathtubs with running hot and cold water.  Those things were difficult, ve
ry, very difficult.
\par NL:\tab Aside from the hunger that you felt most of the time.
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab Never having enough to eat.
\par SS:\tab Right.  But that, you know, the French are unbelievably dirty and filthy, even when they have running water.  They are pigs. [laught
er] They invented nail polish to hide their dirty fingernails.  They invented perfume to cover the stench. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab That's unbelievable.  What you had to endure.  And, so, to come back to Paula.
\par SS:\tab To Paula.
\par NL:\tab You were taking care of Leon when she went on these expeditions to Belgium?  You were keeping house for him?
\par SS:\tab Sure.
\par NL:\tab Washing for him, cooking for him?
\par SS:\tab Sure.
\par NL:\tab So, they were indeed not maintaining you.  You were taking care of them in a large sense.
\par SS:\tab Did I ever tell you how I le
arned about--or did I mention that on tape, I don't know, about the British landing?  I'm sorry, the association is menstruation.  During the war, God knows why, you know, expressions come about, and when in America women will use expressions like "the cu
rse," "having the curse," the expression during the war for some dumb reason was "}{\i\fs24 Les Anglais ont debarqu\'e9s}{\fs24 ."  The British landed [laughter], I never forget the day I bumped into Leon in the village, and he said, "Sonnie, Sonnie }{
\i\fs24 les Anglais ont debarqu\'e9s}{\fs24 !" [much laughter].
\par NL:\tab That was hysterical.  Oh, my!  Yes, you want to say a few words about the Jewish...
\par SS:\tab Yes.  It wasn't until, once I made contact with the relatives in America that they sent and arranged for the paperwork for me to come.  I don't kno
w if I mentioned before, but I came on a special shindig for war orphans, on a special thing.  That's how I was able to come in April '47,  among the earliest post-war, I think.  Then the Jewish agencies, I imagine, maybe my relatives in America must have
 contacted them or something, then they became very interested in me.
\par NL:\tab Was this HIAS, do you know?  Well, it's not important.
\par SS:\tab I could look it up and see what I remember going to the office, the main office in Paris.  I remember that they were giving 
to--as I mentioned to you earlier today, 1947 we were still starving in France.  There was no food, none.  And they were also having rations and food that they received from America, and one day I said, "How come...?" Paula said, "Ask 'em, ask 'em for con
d
ensed milk," and stuff like that, and so foolishly I asked, and the woman looked at me and said, "You, you're too fat.  You don't need that."  If you look at the photos of myself, I was exceedingly overweight, but that was from eating garbage, absolute ju
nk.  And so they felt I, food on me was wasted.  That was one response.  The other response was that the only thing that they really did for me, but, again, that was through the relatives in America, was to arrange for me from Paris.  I took a train to G
\'f6te
borg in Sweden to come to the United States, so I was under their auspices with a group of other Jews, immigrants, for that train ride.  But then they wanted to give me socks and all kinds of things a week before I went to America. [laughter] So, by Ameri
ca I could tell them how good they were to me, and I refused it.  I came with one duffel bag, that's all.
\par NL:\tab This was the experience of most of the other children, too, you gather?
\par SS:\tab To the best of my knowledge, yes.
\par NL:\tab Non-existent help?
\par SS:\tab None.  In 
fact, part of it was--I don't know, I got very bitter.  You could see the director of the place and various people who worked there in an out of huge limousines, chauffeur-driven, etc., and it was that dealing with them was excruciatingly humiliating.  It
 
was a putdown.  What they were doing was so transparent.  Hell, I had survived.  You know, I had survived the French Underground and so on.  I could see what these people were doing.  The last week indoctrinating me about what to tell in America about the
 wonders they had done...
\par NL:\tab So, they should seem to be making a good impression.
\par SS:\tab Right.
\par NL:\tab You went on the "Gripsholm", I think.
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab From Sweden?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab Did you know anybody at all on the ship?
\par SS:\tab No.
\par NL:\tab Not a soul. It must have been a shattering trip for you.
\par SS:\tab It was an interesting trip. In G\'f6teborg a crew of merchant marines from Sweden boarded the boat to rejoin their merchant marine boat in New York.  So that was one set of passengers, aside from th
e handful of Jews.  The other set of passengers were American war brides.  And the two met on top of each other.  It was a floating whorehouse.
\par NL:\tab And you were witness to all of this?
\par SS:\tab Oh, God [laughter]
\par NL:\tab Did it upset you very much?
\par SS:\tab Yes, of course.
\par NL:\tab This was the first image you had of the New World, of America?
\par SS:\tab Of what was going to America.  And yes, here were all these war brides, you know, women from all over that American soldiers were going to marry.  They were rejoining their husbands, new husbands.
\par NL:\tab And committing adultery in the process?
\par SS:\tab Unbelievable.  I mean, it was grotesque.
\par NL:\tab Were there any other young people your age?
\par SS:\tab There were some.  There was one girl in particular, as I look on that photo.  It was, I think, I re
member two girls in particular.  It was really appalling because they were standing in line outside of the women's cabins.  I don't know if that what you call them, down below the deck, with the smell of coal.  I loathe boats.  And they were standing in l
ine, and you could see them staggering out red in the face, huffing and puffing, and it was awful.  So...
\par NL:\tab You landed in New York?
\par SS:\tab Excuse me.  See now.  There it was useful to feel part of }{\i\fs24 Hashomer}{\fs24 , part of Zionism, part of a purity, part of a, you know, a sense, "That's decadent, that's }{\i\fs24 goyim}{\fs24 , that's...
\par NL:\tab You mean, this delineation between the Jewish world and the non-Jewish world?
\par SS:\tab Sure.  Sure.
\par NL:\tab That's interesting.  And you were presumably going to meet with your relatives and live with them?  Was that your understanding?
\par SS:\tab Well...
\par NL:\tab Sonja?
\par SS:\tab Um'm--whatever...
\par NL:\tab In New York and Milwaukee?
\par SS:\tab No, in New York I was met by a cousin of Paula's.  She was a Kubovitzky daughter, Simone was her name, and her husband, Charles.  So Simone was from Belgium, but she and Charles had lived in New York since before the war.
\par NL:\tab I see.
\par SS:\tab They were lovely people.  I liked them a lot.
\par NL:\tab They met you?
\par SS:\tab Simone met me at the bo
at.  And you know, I wasn't the only one.  That was true of everybody almost, standing up high on the boat and there all these people on the pier.  I remember, by the way, I described the distance between the Old World and the New, and as the distance inc
reased, that's when, that was my coming to grips with the reality of the death of my parents.  Seeing the Statue of Liberty, it was quite something.  It was real, you could see it.  And I'm not sure what it meant.  
\par NL:\tab Did you have a feeling of resurgence of hope?  Of the future?
\par SS:\tab Yes.  Yes.
\par NL:\tab That you were glad you had come?
\par SS:\tab I wasn't sure about that.  It was exciting.  It was troubling.
\par NL:\tab Any sense of adventuresomeness perhaps?
\par SS:\tab I think I was scared.  I was scared.  I mean...
\par NL:\tab Going into the unknown.
\par SS:\tab Another language.
\par NL:\tab Another language.
\par NL:\tab You hadn't learned any English?
\par SS:\tab No. I knew "yes" and "no."
\par NL:\tab Oh, without a language.
\par SS:\tab And "please."
\par NL:\tab So did the Kubovitzkys then take you to their home?
\par SS:\tab No. This was Simone, the daughter.  Her last name was something else.
\par NL:\tab They greeted you and then, where did...
\par SS:\tab Simone met me at the boat, and I don't know, you know, by shouting up and back names, that's how we identified.  It took some six hours to disembark and it wasn't El
lis Island, but for all practical purposes, it might have been.  You know, I have seen photos of Ellis Island and these big hangars on the pier in New York.  And the processing was slow.  It took a whole day.  And, of course, as usual, first class first, 
e
tc.  I stayed with Simone and Charles and they had a little girl, Jackie.  She was about four years old, she was a lovely child.  She understood, she spoke French, they taught her French.  So she taught me English in the two days and two nights that I spe
nt there.  And they wanted very much to keep me for a week.  But it happened to fall shortly before }{\i\fs24 Pesach}{\fs24 , and there were the long distance phone calls to the relatives.  I absolutely had to be there for }{\i\fs24 Pesach}{\fs24 .
\par NL:\tab Chicago?
\par SS:\tab Chicago, Milwaukee, the world.  And they really wanted to keep me and I liked these people and I felt comfortable and I wanted to stay.  But, we talked and }{\i\fs24 Vern\'fcnftigkeit}{\fs24 
 [good sense, rationality] had the best of all of us.  "You better go," and I went.  Do you want to hear about the ride from New York to...?
\par NL:\tab If you aren't too tired?
\par SS:\tab I get on the train--there were no plane rides in those days.
\par NL:\tab Again, all alone?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, well that I had got used to.  But after hours and hours on the train, I 
remember when people said, "We're coming close to Chicago.  We're coming close to Chicago," and everybody is excited and I look out the window and I broke up and I wept.  I think, that's the first time ever that I cried publicly.  I looked around--I expec
t
ed, you know, I came from Paris, cosmopolitan city, I came from New York.  Well, like all American cities, the outskirts are awful.  I'd never seen anything like that.  And I imagined that that's Chicago [laughter].  So, then, the relatives picked me up a
n
d there were two or three sets of cousins, distant cousins, and we went to Manfred's apartment.  Manfred was a physician, M.D., Dr. Hoffman.  Now I'm saying it like the French.  You are supposed to say it like the German.  And Manfred had his practice in 
his apartment, which was above some store or other on Devon Avenue.
\par NL:\tab I don't know what that means.
\par SS:\tab She knows what is north? [questioning Barbara Lerner] Devon Avenue is a busy street, commercial street, and their living room was the reception room fo
r the patients, and the three of them, Manfred and his wife and their darling Howard, all shared one bedroom, and I slept in the examination room on one of those. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab Was he still a struggling doctor, or were they just very poor?
\par SS:\tab A stingy doctor.  He still, in 1947, had bags of sugar hidden under his bed [laughter].  And coffee.
\par NL:\tab Incredible.
\par SS:\tab Okay.

\fs24 
\par 
\par NL:\tab This is Tape 5, Side 2 continuing our interview with Dr. Sonja Samson.
\par SS:\tab So, he really meant it, which is absolutely awesome.
\par NL:\tab Meant it when?
\par SS:\tab When they asked me where did I choose to live, "by Milwaukee or by the doctor in Chicago." [laughter]  I was clear.  They lived like sardines.  Of course, I would have preferred li
ving in Chicago.  How can you choose to be four people in that little bedroom?  Anyway, I then also learned what the hurry was about my coming for }{\i\fs24 Pesach}{\fs24 .  Harry in Milwaukee, his brother Manfred in Chicago, had founded their own }{
\i\fs24 shul}{\fs24 , their own synagogue,
 like they did "by Aurich" in Germany, you know, German, Aurich-type services.  And the big shindig, of course, was for Dr. Hoffman to tell the congregation about what a wonderful man he was and how he had imported me and make a big production out of that
.
\par NL:\tab So you had to be produced.
\par SS:\tab In fact, four sets of relatives, Milwaukee, Chicago, in Chicago there was another cousin and her husband, and in Baton Rouge there was the fourth set, had split the fare to bring me over.  The doctor was well-to-do, yes,
 he was.  The cousin in Milwaukee, by now--they all started from scratch, true enough, or whatever they could bring over.  The cousin in Milwaukee had a shoe polish factory.  Doing quite well, thank you.  They all did quite well, thank you.  And they all 
started and made me feel indebted.  I often had the fantasy of giving them each a fourth, a fourth, a fourth of the ticket. [laughter] So, our beginning was not too good. [Tape is turned off and on.]
\par SS:\tab ...have trouble seeing at night?
\par NL:\tab Not really, but I want to get going before it gets dark.  So, Sonja, now would you be good enough to tell us a little about your adjustment to schools?  Which part of the family did you decide to live with?
\par SS:\tab Well, I decided, because it wasn't a decision.  I mean, the s
ituation was so idiotic, that I had to choose Milwaukee.  And you wanted to know about my education.  Okay.  As I indicated, when I came I did not know any English whatsoever.  Moreover, I didn't know any German any more.
\par NL:\tab Really?
\par SS:\tab 
Well, I hadn't spoken it in many, many years, number one.  And number two, for me to know German during the war was very dangerous.  In fact, there were a couple of encounters that I had in the Underground when I was carrying messages.  In one instance on
 
a bridge a German stopped me and looked at me and wanted to investigate my bike.  I was carrying a message, and they were debating in German what to do with me, and so I had to pretend like I didn't understand it, and if they had looked at me, you know, I
 was passing as a dumb peasant girl, and that was one of the more frightening experiences.
\par NL:\tab So you had to repress all of that?
\par SS:\tab Right, and I had to look, you know, like a dumb...
\par NL:\tab Peasant girl.
\par SS:\tab Right, and yet I understood every word and they were really seriously debating and considering what to do.  So it was very frightening.
\par BL:\tab Whether to kill you or not.
\par SS:\tab Yeah.  But besides that and all the things, anyway, besides that, the issue was, you know, there was no opportunity to speak German.  I was five when I had left Germany, remember?
\par NL:\tab That's right.
\par SS:\tab And now I'm 16.  So, I arrived in Milwaukee in a 180% pure German-speaking household.  There was Harry and his wife.  There was the old lady and the old man, her parents, good }{\i\fs24 Onkel}{\fs24  Solly and }{\i\fs24 Tante}{\fs24  Meta and }{
\i\fs24 es war alles Deutsch}{\fs24  [it was all German], and the child that they had produced between all of them. [laughter]  She spoke better German than English, to give you an idea.  She was born in Milwaukee.
\par NL:\tab But spoke better German than English?
\par SS:\tab 
Yes, so began a new war.  I thought of it as a war after the war.  If anything really killed my sense of humor, my optimism, my drive, it was Milwaukee.  I simply was not prepared to undertake a new war, and that's what it was.  They disapproved of
 everything about me.  First of all, there was the French accent.  I learned English of course, French was my language.  I was never literate in German.  So, forever, when I spoke English, they would correct my accent with a German accent.  That's why I h
a
ve a bastard accent, by the way.  I had to learn German all over again, because that was what was spoken at home, and every time I opened my mouth in English, it was being corrected by a German accent.  And they had come to America as adults, you know, in
 1938, '39, '38.  So, this is 1947, and they were not very linguistically inclined, so you can imagine.
\par NL:\tab What about your schooling?  Where did you go to school?
\par SS:\tab That's where I'm going.  So one of the things was, my idea was one thing: to go to school; their idea was to have a maid.  And...
\par NL:\tab To make you the maid?
\par SS:\tab Right, and so first thing, they sent to me a place for new Americans, which was an evening course with adults, where they taught English, and I didn't want any part of that.  None.  The
y were all sitting there with their dictionaries, translating in and out.  You know, all this nonsense.
\par NL:\tab What disturbed you about that?
\par SS:\tab That's not how you learn a language.  I mean, I had learned, you know, different languages before and I knew that that was not the way.  When you are in a country you speak the language with people, not with foreigners.
\par NL:\tab This was translation.
\par SS:\tab Yes, that's when--one of the things I did was, I went to the library and I got books, I knew the plot and in French like }{\i\fs24 Crime and Punishment}{\fs24 
 by Dostoevsky, one of my favorite books, and since I know the plot I got the book in English.  And I read it and I kept getting books where I knew the plot, so that wouldn't stop me, and I just kept reading in English.
\par NL:\tab And you used a dictionary?
\par SS:\tab Not at all.
\par NL:\tab Not at all?
\par SS:\tab No. Just read.
\par NL:\tab Just read?  And not understanding many of the words, but understanding the sense?
\par SS:\tab I knew the plot. I had read Dostoevsky in French.  I knew it.
\par NL:\tab Also, of course, there is a great similarity between French and English.
\par SS:\tab Right, anyway, so then came summer school.  And I asked...
\par NL:\tab But meanwhile, you had to do a lot of housework in the house?
\par SS:\tab Sure.  Yeah.  Summer school.  I found out there is
 summer school, and I told my cousins I wanted to go to summer school.  Would they be kind enough to accompany me and act as an interpreter for the principal?  So we went to the school.  The high school there was Riverside High in Milwaukee.  The principa
l was a man by the name of Mr. Schnecker.  Milwaukee is a German town, you know.  It was in those days.
\par NL:\tab Yeah.
\par SS:\tab And so, he asked me through my cousin what courses did I want to take.  And I said, two courses in Physics, no, one course in Physics and o
ne in Chemistry and one in English.  And they argued, you know, they talked between the two of them, and I could understand some of it, but it was preposterous.  You know, now I had to start with the first English.  I'll take any English that you want.  M
y idea...
\par NL:\tab Yes, I was going to ask why you chose Physics.
\par SS:\tab Because in Physics and Chemistry the key words are the same in English as in French.
\par NL:\tab Aha!  
\par SS:\tab Right?  And my idea was to be among English-speaking and to, as quickly as I could, accumulate credits so I could graduate and get a high school diploma.
\par NL:\tab Were you able to get any sort of transcript from France?
\par SS:\tab Didn't matter.
\par NL:\tab Or, how would you become eligible for college?  I mean, you didn't have any school records.
\par SS:\tab Well, I finagled.  I got an A in Physics and in Chemistry.
\par NL:\tab Aha.
\par SS:\tab I got a 90 out of a 100 in English.  So, I went back to Mr. Schnecker at the end of summer school when I now could speak a little.  The other thing is I immediately took a job.  I worked, I forget w
hat my first job was.  I think, I worked in a bakery or a grocery, some place.  Number one, I wanted money.  Do you know that at the end of a year-and-one-half when I left Milwaukee for Chicago, I had saved $500.  To give you an idea in those days, babysi
tting costs, you earned 25 cents for the whole night.
\par NL:\tab For the whole night?
\par SS:\tab Yes [laughter].
\par NL:\tab You must have worked many, many hours?
\par SS:\tab Oh, sure.  But anyway, when regular school started in fall, I went to see this nice principal and I said--and I
 took more advanced courses.  The way in which I did it, literally in a year-and-a-half, was, I kept arguing with him, "How could you pass Physics if you didn't...?" and I took a course in Trigonometry.  How could you pass Trigonometry, which I did with a
n A, without Algebra or Geometry, right?  He said, "You can't." I said, "Then you can give me credit for that, can't you?" and he said, "I guess I'll have to." [laugher] 
\par NL:\tab I see.  Had you studied some of these other subjects at that terrible school?
\par SS:\tab 
Well, look, I did.  I made a thing--during--I was born in 1931, arrived in Milwaukee 1947.  During the--okay, during those years, I was in four different countries, 18 different places, 12 different regions, and 9 different schools, when I was in school. 
 Most of the time I was not in school.  I  could read.
\par NL:\tab But Trigonometry is a fairly complex mathematics.
\par SS:\tab But you've got to read.  
\par NL:\tab Okay.  I just think your mastering of English must have been phenomenal?
\par SS:\tab No, I...
\par NL:\tab Of course, it was!  
\par SS:\tab I--I...
\par NL:\tab Well, you see mastery of English and a diploma and so on as a way of liberating yourself from this family, too, and becoming an autonomous person.
\par SS:\tab Remember, my goal was to go and get an education and graduate from a university.
\par NL:\tab So, you were highly motivated.
\par SS:\tab And I found out that people in America graduate school when they are 18.  When I was 18, I was going to graduate.  And I did the same with college.
\par NL:\tab Was there any person in your life during those years who gave you any sense of reinforcement or help? Or sustenance?
\par SS:\tab I had one friend in Milwaukee, George. George was exactly my age, and George had survived Auschwitz.  Except George was Hungarian.  His English was awful. [laughter] I don't believe that Hungarians are capable o
f learning any language in the world. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab He was struggling with English?
\par SS:\tab Yes.
\par NL:\tab So you were able to talk to each other about the war...?
\par SS:\tab Not really.  George talked very little about the war.  George was busy finagling.  George was goi
ng to make headway, and George was a very hedonistic man, and I always kidded him and I said to him, "George, you will either marry a blonde who looks like a movie star, or you'll marry a woman who's very rich." I saw him many years later in Chicago and G
e
orge indeed had gone through medical school and he had wanted--he always talked about wanting to be an obstetrician.  He liked the idea of giving birth after Auschwitz.  Instead, he became a psychiatrist and he kidded me.  He said, "Sonja, I didn't marry 
money.  I married a blonde." [laughter] And he became a psychiatrist who couldn't speak English. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab Well, it gave him a certain European quality which, I guess, has its advantages.  So you prevailed on this principle to give you the necessary credits.
\par SS:\tab He was a swell man.
\par NL:\tab He was a sensible man.
\par SS:\tab Right.  He realized that I was stubborn.  He always--he also appreciated...
\par NL:\tab Of course.
\par SS:\tab ...that I delivered what I promised.
\par NL:\tab Did you get any help, any special encouragement from any teacher?
\par SS:\tab Yes, there were two; one was a dumb teacher, Miss Dunway, who really was very nice, very sweet.  She taught French.  And she was very stupid.  I conned her into giving me credits for French.  And as a trade-off, I translated stuff for her and w
hatever.  There was another teacher whom I really liked.  Her name was Miss Zeman.  And she had an advanced course, her creative English course, and I got into that, and there were very few students in that course.  And she was nice.  I remember she invit
ed a few of the other kids and myself, you know, special group, Christmas Day at her house, and she had a car and sometimes she took me for rides.  Yes, she was very good, very supportive.
\par NL:\tab And so you got your diploma?  And then decided to go to Chicago?
\par SS:\tab 
Yes.  Then I went to the Jewish Vocational Service in Milwaukee.  And they had a psychologist.  I remember her name, Snitson [or Slipson?], she was nice.  She gave me a complete battery of tests.  That's where I had my first exposure to the Rorschach.
  She gave me a Rorschach.  And it's funny, after 20 some years of administering the Rorschach, that's what's so marvelous about that instrument, I can still--and, you know, having tested hundreds and hundreds of people--I can remember with great vividnes
s some of my responses.  It's a wonderful test.
\par NL:\tab Extraordinary.
\par SS:\tab Anyway, on the basis of that, they decided that I was highly motivated, I had a lot of good drive and so on, and that's the first time that anybody ever really helped me.  They awarded m
e a scholarship, tuition scholarship to any university of my choice.  I guess, I must have done pretty good on their tests.
\par NL:\tab You must have been exceptionally well.
\par SS:\tab They gave me a whole battery. 
\par NL:\tab Oh yes!
\par SS:\tab So my choice was the University of Chicago.
\par NL:\tab Aha.
\par SS:\tab And I went to the University of Chicago, and I applied and they interviewed me and everything, and they accepted me.  However, they said, under no circumstances, no way at all, would I be able to wor
k and go to school, to the college.  That it was much too demanding, and they wouldn't hear of it. So that was the end of that dream.  I couldn't go to the University of Chicago.
\par NL:\tab They couldn't give you any help, any subsidy.
\par SS:\tab That was before affirmative action and, and packages. [laughter].  You earned what you got.  
\par NL:\tab Oh my God...
\par SS:\tab So, that's how come I choose Roosevelt University in Chicago, which had a very good program.  It was an interesting school.  It was founded in 1946.  It was the fir
st university in the country that had, that eliminated all admission quotas.  It was the first university in the country that admitted people on the basis other than quotas.  It attracted professors from all over the country, because of that, and many of 
the professors...
\par NL:\tab You mean, quotas or formal credits?
\par SS:\tab No, no quotas.  
\par NL:\tab Quotas...
\par SS:\tab Remember, in those days they had Jewish quotas...
\par NL:\tab Oh yes.
\par SS:\tab ...black quotas, green quotas.  
\par NL:\tab [unclear]
\par SS:\tab Yes, yes, Roosevelt was founded on this concept.
\par NL:\tab A liberal arts school?
\par SS:\tab Yes.  Many of the professors were working on their Ph.D.'s at the University of Chicago.   Many came from all over the country to teach there out of ideology.  And most of the students were the GI's.  
\par NL:\tab Ah yes...
\par SS:\tab So it was an extremely exciting, good place.
\par NL:\tab And they let you work.
\par SS:\tab Of course, it was a semester system and, yeah, it was a great school.
\par NL:\tab So you got your BA there?
\par SS:\tab 
Got my BA there by working.  I worked at several factories.  I got fired from a few.  I got fired from several.  I worked for Eastman Kodak and I got fired because it was piecework and I exceeded--you know, they had a system of every week they posted how 
many pieces did everybody do, and I did more than the others [laughter] and the best of them.
\par NL:\tab You were a rate buster.
\par SS:\tab I was a rate buster!  I didn't know that.  I learned that.
\par NL:\tab You couldn't slow down?
\par SS:\tab I didn't know that.  You know, I mean, the idea was to do as fast as you can and get more money.
\par NL:\tab So management fired you or the union got you fired?
\par SS:\tab God no, there was no union.
\par NL:\tab Oh, that's right.
\par SS:\tab So, I went from one factory to another.  The last, you know, one was Republic Steel. 
 I was making steel drills, that is, the tip of the drill on an enormous grinding wheel, you know, where you measure the tip with a micro somebody.  And there I got very angry because I understood what was going on.  The men working right next to me, the 
s
ame huge grinding wheel, and it was very dangerous.  One guy slashed his leg and almost cut it off.  I mean, it was very dangerous.  The men were making 75 cents an hour and I was making 50 cents an hour to do the identical same thing.  Roosevelt Universi
t
y, then Roosevelt College, had started a Labor Education program.  And their director, the first, one of the first early programs in the country, 1949, 1950.  So one day, coming home from the factory in summer, in blue jeans full of dust and grease and al
l the rest of it, which wasn't done in those days--Roosevelt was located in downtown Chicago and women only wore skirts and blouses--in my }{\i\fs24 shlumpy}{\fs24 
 dirty jeans, I went up there and asked to speak to Frank McCallister who was the director of that program.  An
d I told him that I wanted to work with him in unionizing that place. [laughter] So, he listened to me and about, oh, I don't know, a few months later, he called me and he said, "I've got good news for you and bad news.  The bad news is, I don't think it 
will work to unionize that place.  The good news, I need an interpreter." He had just gotten the business under the Marshall Plan.  Trade union leaders from Europe were coming to the United States to study.
\par NL:\tab So you had to interpret for them?
\par SS:\tab He hired me as an interpreter.  Now I was making }{\i\fs24 beaucoup}{\fs24 
 money.  Wow, you  know, and I got to travel around the country and it got to be a joke between us, because he would call me and say, "Well, there's a group of three or four, you know, and it's going to be o
n these dates.  Can you make it or not?"  He knew not to ask me.  Of course, I would go any time.  And I'd study around it and so on.  Through that I met some rather marvelous people.  I met one man, Beaubien [she pronounces it "Beaubain."], who had a pos
ition in France comparable to the one that occupied by Walter Reuther, who at the time was the head of the automobile workers, and so Beaubien and I became very good friends because most of the idiots in interpretation and translation would always say, "}
{\i\fs24 Qu'est-ce qu'il dit, Madame, qu'est-ce qu'il dit, Madame}{\fs24 ?"  "What's he saying?  What's he saying?" always afraid of missing a word.
\par NL:\tab You let the conversation flow?
\par SS:\tab Whereas with Beaubien, you know, he would let me ask the questions for him.  He knew I w
ould hit what he wanted to know.  We worked out a very nice little thing there.  So I went with him and met Walter Reuther.  He was a friend of Victor Reuther, who was in Paris, and I met the Detroit crowd and so on.  So those were good years.
\par NL:\tab Yes, yes.  Those were the halcyon years of American trade union activity.
\par SS:\tab Well, they were good years for me, too.  
\par NL:\tab They were good years for you, too.
\par SS:\tab I was making a lot of money. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab Well, thank you for that.  Now, could we swing back, because I don't want to forget your interest in speaking about Grandmother?
\par SS:\tab Before we go to my grandmother, I just would like to add with a note of sadness, I had over the years several times written a letter to the people at the Jewish Vocational in Milwa
ukee, and I never mailed it, the letter.  But it was saying to them in the letter was, "Dear People, I think it's rather sad that you have never followed up on what I did with the scholarship..."
\par NL:\tab They never did...?
\par SS:\tab "...that you so generously awarded me."
\par NL:\tab Ah, why don't you write that letter, and mail it?  Wow!  Mail it.  Resolve that, find out what happened.
\par SS:\tab They are all dead.
\par NL:\tab Are they?
\par SS:\tab Sure.  Dr. Sheldon, the psychologist, was a lady then in her late 50's, 60's and all the people, I mean, they...
\par NL:\tab Did they continue awarding scholarships, as far as you know?
\par SS:\tab I have no idea.  Whether I was the only one or whether there were millions. [laughter] Until the day I got my BA, I sent them, you know, the tuition thing, or the University did, and they paid.
\par NL:\tab But no follow through?
\par SS:\tab Never.  I mean it's crazy. [laughter]
\par NL:\tab It's really ghostly.  Very strange. [pause] Do you want to step back to the story now about Grandmother, or can you think of other points in your experiences that you would like to comment on?
\par SS:\tab Okay.  Before we go on, I want to reflect on the fact that that is really how I learned English.  I learned English by mingl
ing with Americans.  I learned English by thinking English.  It's interesting.  I can think of words when I learned them.  I remember the first time that I heard the word "kids".  And I had no idea what it meant.  And then somebody thought of telling me "
c
hildren."   I knew "children" and not "kid" and so on.  I never translated ever.  The idea was to think in the language.  And what I would do if I didn't know a word in writing or reading that was important, I looked it up in an English-English dictionary
,
 looked up the word till I found the word, saw if there was a word that I understood.  If I didn't, I would take that word and look it up and kept going.  Sometimes it meant looking up five or six words until I found one that I really understood, and then
 go back.
\par NL:\tab So you never used a French-English dictionary?
\par SS:\tab I bought my first French-English dictionary after I graduated, after I got my BA.  That was my reward.
\par NL:\tab Interesting.  Did you listen to the radio, too?  Did you learn some English that way?
\par SS:\tab No, I only listened to classical music.
\par NL:\tab Music.
\par SS:\tab They didn't have TV in those days.
\par NL:\tab Of course not.
\par SS:\tab I guess TV would have helped.
\par NL:\tab I know some Russian newcomers, Russian Jewish newcomers, learn English through television.
\par SS:\tab I would imagine so.
\par NL:\tab It's a good device.  Now, Sonja, we can go back now a bit.  Which grandmother is it you want to speak of?  Is it mother's mother?
\par SS:\tab Yeah, my father's mother died before I was born.  I was named after her.  I think that the story about my g
randmother is too lengthy, the hour is late.  It's involved.  I would prefer to meet you again, or I'll make a tape and I'll mail it to you, okay?
\par NL:\tab All right, Sonja.  Now before we end, are there any thoughts you have about leaving some word for young p
eople who will be studying this history, the history of the Holocaust, in future years?  Any warnings or ideas that you would like to share with them?
\par SS:\tab That's a lot in two minutes!
\par NL:\tab No, not two minutes.  You can take a while or do you want to think about that and also...
\par SS:\tab I can start off the top of my head.
\par NL:\tab Okay.
\par SS:\tab That's a difficult question...
\par (The interview ended here.  It was hoped that Dr. Samson would mail another tape, but she became ill.  After numerous false starts, it was diagnosed 
as lung cancer of a fast ravaging kind.  She underwent heroic therapies at Sloan-Kettering, but succumbed August 16, 1986.  See letters dated April 25, 1986, and August 11, 1986.)
