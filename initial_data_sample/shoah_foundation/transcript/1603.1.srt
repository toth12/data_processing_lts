It was great.

high middle-class life,

you would say in America.

to the horses for horse
riding and things like that.

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,990
And every year, we

44
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,860

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,660
What was her, her occupation.

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,500
PF: My mother was a housewife.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,100
And she was a daughter
of a, a doctor.

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,360
My grandfather was a doctor, a
professor here in a hospital.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,500
He was an ear, nose,
throat specialist.

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,130
And so when my mother
married my father,

58
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,270
that she became a housewife.

59
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,630

INT: 'Us,' meaning you and--

61

PF: My sister.

62

I have a sister.

INT: What's her name and--

64
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,150
PF: Marika, Maria is her

65
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,500


66
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,145
INT: So in the--
during the weekends,

67
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,060
what were you doing
with your family?

68
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,580
What was your family life like?

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,800
Were you going to
a, to a synagogue?

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,130
Or were you religious?

71
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,805
PF: As far as religion
is concerned, no,

72
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,540
we were not religious.

73
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,770
My grandmother was religious.

74
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,230
So many times my father
would take us over

75
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,075
to my grandmother's
place, and my sister and I

76
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:13,630
would stay there on the
weekend or something.

77
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,110
Then we would go
through all the rituals,

78
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,530
and all the religious rituals.

79
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,440
But other than
that, in our home,

80
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,920
we weren't religious at all.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,200
We, we were not.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,560
We did not go to synagogues
on a weekly basis.

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,190
Once in a great while we would,
but not on a regular basis,

84
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,850
we would not.

85
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,120
INT: So what was your hobby?

86
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,545
I mean, what were
you doing as a child?

87
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:53,070
PF: As a child, one time
I watched my father--

88
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,170
we had a piano at home.

89
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,950
And my father liked
to play the piano.

90
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:05,320
And at eight, seven, I was,
I was watching my father play

91
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:13,550
that old 'Sonny Boy' tune that's
from a very old, I think 1930,

92
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,180
American-- the first sound
movie, I think, in America.

93
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,370
Al Jolson, Al Jolson
was singing that tune.

94
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,140
[SINGING]

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,600
And I was listening to that,
and I said to my father,

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,800
I said, jeez, I
like this very much.

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,352
Can I learn that?

98
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,310
And he said, certainly.

99
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,090
So I sat next to
him, and that's how

100
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,520
I started playing the piano.

101
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,750
And I copied him and
played that tune.

102
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,600
And then many times
when I was alone,

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,420
I would play for hours, the same
tune over and over and over.

104
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,640
And it didn't bother me.

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,480
It probably bothered
the neighbors,

106
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,070
but it didn't bother me.

107
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:09,230
And then I started
learning other songs.

108
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,290
And interestingly enough, if
I liked a tune or something,

109
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:21,810
I was able, by trial and error,
to play another tune by myself.

110
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,110
And so piano was one.

111
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,740
And, and another thing was
at my grandmother's place,

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,650
she had a chess board.

113
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,910
And she taught, she taught me
how to set up chess figures.

114
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,780
And so at a very early age,
I started playing chess.

115
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,560
INT: How old?

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,226
Do you remember?

117
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:44,620
PF: Oh, about seven.

118
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,580
And I, and I learned
how to move correctly.

119
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,930
And I played with people.

120
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,890
And it enter--
entertained me a lot.

121
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,380
So that's how I
think in my life I

122
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,460
learned enjoying challenges a
lot from very early childhood.

123
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,890
Playing complicated things,
doing complicated things,

124
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,250
but enjoying it a lot.

125
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,510
I had [PAUSES FOR 4 SECONDS]
a gentlemen

126
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,160
who was about 12 years
older-- my grandmother hired

127
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,540
him to be my home teacher and
to, to, to teach me things.

128
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:37,400
And, and, and, and his first

129
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,169
or so, he taught me
a poem in Hungarian.

[HUNGARIAN]

131
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,150
And that was about 50
years, 58 years ago.

132
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,790
And I still remember that.

133

That gentlemen now in Canada.

He's a literature professor
and teaches in college.

135
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,380
And I just wrote to him, isn't
it interesting that I have

136
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,878
learned my first poem from you.

PF: Certainly.

140
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,260
It says, the [NON-ENGLISH]

the animals, and he's
sitting on a donkey.

And he says, [HUNGARIAN].

143
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,090
And his legs are
touching the ground.

144
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,620
And that's what it means.

145
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,120
And it's about
this [NON-ENGLISH],

146
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,855
this keeper who
watches-- a cowboy.

147
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:40,760
[PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS]
That what this poem about.

148
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,660
I don't remember the whole
poem, but I remember that much.

149
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,110
And we had a lot
of active things.

150
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,440
My father exposed us
to a lot of things.

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,950
We traveled a lot
at an early age.

152
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,860
Every year-- every year
we went to Italy to--

153
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,800
to-- for summertime.

154
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,160
And so I loved the train.

155
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,380
I loved to train.

156
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,660
I loved it.

157
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,160
I loved that rhythm of the way
the tracks are put together.

158
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,810
And they don't fit perfectly,
and it gives a certain noise.

159
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,500
And I love it.

160
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,410
I love it.

161
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,650
And it has a rhythm.

162
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,150
And [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS]
so I, I, I--

163
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,390
just traveling on-- just sitting
in a train, I enjoyed it.

164
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:46,020
Probably being by myself or
not too many people around me

165
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,260
and then seeing the
scenery which changes,

166
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,300
watching the people
and the scenery

167
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,060
and thinking on who
these people could be

168
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,680
and what are they doing.

169
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,920
And it was very
entertaining for me.

170
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,170
And then-- so--

171
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,640
Then sometimes we would go to
Czechoslovakia, which is also

172
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:22,000
surrounding country of Hungary,
and see things and experience

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,500
things.

174
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,230


175
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,010
INT: Was it to visit family,
or just to sight-see?

176
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,590
PF: To see things.

177
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,950
To see things.

178
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,630
We had a very close
family in a sense.

179
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,070
My grandfather had a
huge, enormous huge home

180
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,930
in [INAUDIBLE] in Budapest.

181
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:51,540
And then every weekend the whole
family would meet there, once

182
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,200
a week almost.

183
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,500
And he had enormous,
big balcony he had.

184
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,740
And then the whole
family would sit there,

185
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,090
and we would have
breakfast there,

186
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,370
and we would talk
with each other.

187
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,580
And it was really
beautiful, you know.

188
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,751
That-- it was peaceful
and beautiful.

189
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:13,250
And--

190
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,210


191
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,264
INT: Which school did
you go to in, in--

192
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:24,850
PF: In Hungary, I went
to an elementary school.

193
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,340
It's a different system
like, like in America.

194
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,180
In Hungary, you go four years
to an elementary school.

195
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,250
And after, you
switch to a school

196
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,790
what here you would call maybe
a high school kind of thing.

197
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,820
But it's different because
over there, eight years-- now,

198
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,850
after the four years
you are finished,

199
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,610
you go eight years
into the same school.

200
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,050
And then you graduate there,
and then you go to college

201
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,690
if you want to and so on.

202
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:08,670
So I went to the [INAUDIBLE]
Jewish School in Hungary.

203
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,949
INT: So how-- were your comrades
in school and you had friends?

204
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:14,115
PF: Did I have friends in
school? [BACKGROUND NOISE]

205
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:15,250
INT: Yeah.

206
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,540
PF: I had some friends,
yes. [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS]

207
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,460
And some of them died.

208
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,335
And that was very sad,
after the war when

209
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,750
I discovered that they died.

210
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,810
But when I went to
school, I had a family--

211
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,210
we knew-- my father knew-- my
father knew that family called

212
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,280
the [? Landesmant ?] family.

213
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,730
And they had about
four or five members

214
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,880
of that family going
to that school.

215
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,330
And they were very
close friends of mine.

216
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,900
Because of family ties
through my parents,

217
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,770
they were friends, so we
were very close friends.

218
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,850
But basically I was
a very open kid,

219
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,940
and I was friendly
to almost everybody.

220
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,930
Almost everybody.

221
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,670
Sometimes cruel, very
cruel, but friendly.

222
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:26,620
Sometimes I made very cruel
practical jokes in school.

223
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,380
There was, in my days-- I don't
know, do you want to hear it?

224
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
INT: Yes, please.

225
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,430
PF: In my days, we had for
the ink what we were writing,

226
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,210
we had a little ink holder.

227
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,220
It looked like a top
hat turned around.

228
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,430
And that's where the ink was in.

229
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,880
And then we had a pen.

230
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,930
You had to immerse the pen
and then write with it.

231
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,890
And there was also plenty
of empty, these ink

232
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,170
holders, no ink in them.

233
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,120
And, and one of my friends
next to me, sitting next to me,

234
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,020
was clowning and picking
up these empty ink holders

235
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,570
and putting them on his head,
like he would be saluting

236
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,810
to people with these top hats.

237
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,555
And I switched one of
these empties with one

238
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:22,120
which was full with ink.

239
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,530
And then he picked it up
and put it on his head.

240
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,870
And he didn't realize
what's happening.

241
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,630
And he was just keep on going.

242
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,640
And the teacher didn't
see what's happening.

243
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,760
And then slowly the ink started
pouring out on his face.

244
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,740
He still didn't realize it.

245
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,830
And then the whole class
started laughing enormously.

246
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,250
And then naturally the teacher
stopped it and realized it.

247
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,830
And then he had to go
out and wash himself.

248
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,230
And he was a close and
very good-hearted friend.

249
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,610
But he was like the
son of Frankenstein,

250
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,370
a huge person, about four
times bigger than I was.

251
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:17,090
And after the class was
over, [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS]

252
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,540
he chased me.

253
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,920
And he caught up with
me, and he picked me up,

254
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,156
and he pushed me
against the wall.

255
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:28,310
And then he let me go,
and then I just fell down.

256
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:35,580
He really didn't hurt me, and--
[PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] but just

257
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,200
was very angry for
a very good reason.

258
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,260
So I went home and
everything and I was in bed

259
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,840
when-- and it was late, and
my mother said-- I was almost

260
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,700
getting ready to sleep.

261
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,140
And my mother said,
somebody's calling you.

262
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,950
And his name was Steiner.

263
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,940
And Steiner-- Robert
Steiner was his name.

264
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,450
And he was calling me and
[PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS]

265
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,410
he cried on the telephone.

266
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,849
And he said, I hope I
didn't hurt you when

267
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,210
I threw you against the wall.

268
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,480
And this is something
so beautiful

269
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,619
that I won't forget
as long as I live.

270
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:34,850
And more so because after the
war was over I met his mother.

271
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,010
And I said to her mother--
they lived very close

272
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,800
where we lived-- I asked
her mother, I said,

273
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,430
where is Robbie?

274
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,211
And she said, well,
didn't you know?

275
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:49,145
I said, no.

276
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,920
Know what?

277
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,390
And Robbie survived.

278
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,510
And after the war, after
the war for us in Budapest,

279
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:06,710
the war wasn't over, his mother
sent him out to get bread.

280
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,130
And he went out to get
bread, and a small bomb

281
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,520
hit him and tore him
into pieces, and he died.

282
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,282
And that's how I found
out that he died.

283
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,846
INT: Do you know which year?

284
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:31,770
PF: That was in
1945, early 1945.

285
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,000
Because we were liberated
in January 1945,

286
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,870
and so that was after
the liberation or so.

287
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:49,060
And so I never going to
forget Robbie, my friend.

288
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,120
And I hope he's listening to
me. [PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] And

289
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:05,870
[PAUSES FOR 5 SECONDS] many,
many people in the school I,

290
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,530
[PAUSES FOR 4 SECONDS]
I didn't know.

291
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,000
But it was an
interesting thing also,

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,010
an experience that-- because
there was not enough room.

293
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,640
We had to switch.

294
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,770
So there were girls separately
and boys going separately

295
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,040
in the same classes.

296
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,030
But let's say the boys would be
going from 8:00 in the morning

297
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,780
till noon, and the girls would
come at 12:30 and be till 4:00.

298
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:51,310
And one day-- one day, I left
my book in-- in-- in my place

299
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,230
where I was sitting.

300
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,600
And my name was written
in it, Peter Fischl.

301
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:09,150
And so the a girl who sat in the
same place knew who sits there.

302
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,990
And she carved in,
heaven knows why,

303
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:20,630
she carved in this wooden
[PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] chair

304
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,910
in the writing arrangement--
I don't know if you're

305
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,880
familiar with it, old European
school system where you sit

306
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,110
and then here is
where you write.

307
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,230
And everything is
made out of wood.

308
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,840
And she carved in that--
she carved in a heart

309
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,812
and she said-- she wrote in--
carved in, 'I love you, Peter.'

310
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:51,910
And, and till this day,
I'm thinking who Renee

311
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,410
could have been.

312
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:59,420
And many times,
I'm thinking was--

313
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,700
that I should have maybe made
a harder effort to search

314
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,720
for her, which I did not.

315
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,385
It's kind of the
mystery woman in my life

316
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:13,350
and the mystery
person in my life.

you at that time?

318
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,460
PF: Oh, probably 12 or 13.

319
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,550
And then [PAUSES FOR 5 SECONDS]
because maybe I'm

320
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,480
thinking of her a lot, maybe
because she was only person who

321
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,520
just sent love towards me.

322
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,630
And so that was something,
an interesting thing.

323
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,054
INT: What do you mean by the
only one sending you love?

324
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,740


325
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,970
PF: Well, because in
life-- because in life,

326
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,340
you meet people and
then you fall in love

327
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,050
and then later on
disappointments start coming

328
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,980
and-- because nobody's
perfect and so on.

329
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,930
So then relationships
weaken, marriages

330
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,800
are breaking up, like mine.

331
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,110
And with her, there
was nothing like that

332
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,070
because that's the only
experience we had is just

333
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,070
this one writing experience.

334
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,460

PF: I did not know
where she-- who she was.

336
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,280
No, never.

337
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,321
Never.

338
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:29,820
Never.

339
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:37,790
But it-- maybe it's not too
late to-- to do a search.

340
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,590
And naturally, I still see
her as a certain, you know,

341
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,900
girl in my mind, because
I cannot accept that--

342
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:52,870
my mind cannot accept
52 years which went by.

343
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:59,980
And the school was a very
good school, very interesting.

344
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,240
I learned a lot of things.

345
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,550
INT: Peter, can you tell me why
there were not any ink in the,

346
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,590
in the school?

347
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,220
You said there was
some that were empty.

348
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,550
Why, do you know?

349
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,330
PF: I think that was
just a matter of chance,

350
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,835
and heaven knows why those
little ink holders were empty

351
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,630
and they were there.

352
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,250
I have no idea.

353
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:33,250
Maybe-- it could been that
maybe not in every space people

354
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,120
were sitting.

355
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,620
And only maybe they filled
up the places with ink

356
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,160
where somebody was
sitting and writing.

357
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,730
So maybe it was
every three or four

358
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,820
places where nobody
was sitting, there

359
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,310
is no ink on those things.

360
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,920
And maybe somebody
pulled them out.

361
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,420
INT: OK.

362
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,220
There was no--

363
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,370
PF: Maybe Robbie
pulled it out himself.

364
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,610
I don't remember that detail.

365
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,530
But I just remember the fact
that he had these empties

366
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,780
around him and he was clowning.

367
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,000
That's when my mind
started working and doing

368
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,190
this thing towards him.

369
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,080
INT: What were you
doing with your sister?

370
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,470
How old was your sister at--

371
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,810
PF: My sister is about 2 and
1/2 years older than I am.

372
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:23,790
So basically I lived a very
lonely life as a child,

373
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,950
because my sister was a
very attractive young lady.

374
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,770
And so at age 12,
13, there was a lot

375
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,533
of boys who were interested in
her and came up to our house

376
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:41,310
and sat around there.

377
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,250
And sometimes there
was 10, 15 boys

378
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,500
sitting there just to be around
my sister and talk with her.

379
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,820
And nobody was really
interested in me.

380
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,530
And my father was a
very busy businessman

381
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,410
and under tremendous pressure.

382
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,110
I really don't recall
a lot of things,

383
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,600
a lot of times where he
really would have been

384
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,360
with me and with us really.

385
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,600
I, I, I just remember sometimes
dinners and breakfasts

386
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,030
and, and lunches.

387
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,390
But I really don't remember
that my father and I would have,

388
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,930
what they say here in America,
would have went fishing.

389
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,150
I never went fishing
with my father.

390
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,976
I could write a book about this.

391
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,720
INT: What was your
father doing exactly?

392
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,800


393
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,990
PF: Well, my grandmother
and my grandfather

394
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,640
came from a small town where
they worked themself up

395
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,320
into business.

396
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,065
And so my-- when my father was
a little boy, they-- his parents

397
00:25:57,065 --> 00:26:00,260
were very well doing already.

398
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,370
And so my grandmother made
it sure that my father

399
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,860
goes into a good school
and meets the right people.

400
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,420
And then he set my
father up in business.

401
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,000
Actually, my grandfather
had a business

402
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,890
called Leopold Fischl and Son.

403
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,560
And their business is something
which, to my knowledge,

404
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,530
is-- it's probably around
in America, too, or was,

405
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,770
but I never heard of it.

406
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:38,110
Is a person who works with
the large farmers and--

407
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,745
Let's say, here the
government helps

408
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:43,980
the farmers, the medium
farmers and large farmers.

409
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,120
In, in, in Hungary,
my father would

410
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,580
be like working with these
medium and large farming

411
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,550
people, and let's say
buying the livestock a year

412
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,290
or two years ahead of the
time before they really

413
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,120
want to sell it.

414
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,540
So actually they worked
with my father's money.

415
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,030
And then once the
livestock grew up,

416
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,960
then, then it
belonged to my father.

417
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,640
And they made their profit, and
then my father would resell it,

418
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,690
export it also.

419
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,920
My father exported
to Israel also.

420
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,860
And matter of fact,
matter of fact, my father

421
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:42,070
gave some livestock as gifts to
Israel to a kibbutz in Israel.

422
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,610
And I don't remember
now the name,

423
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:53,780
but I think it was a kibbutz
where Hannah Senesh wanted

424
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,720
to go, I think.

425
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,040
You heard of Hannah Senesh.

426
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,280
INT: At what time--
what time period?

427
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,050
PF: Well, that was before
she escaped from Hungary

428
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:10,160
and got captured.

429
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:19,940
That was done in probably
in 1938, 1938 or so.

430
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,600
At that time in Israel, they
had problems with the British.

431
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,850


432
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,830
And so this was part of
my father's business.

433
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,690
But my father was
[PAUSES FOR 4 SECONDS] doing

434
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,980
anything besides this, which--
he was what you would call,

435
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,480
like, an entrepreneur.
[PAUSES FOR 3 SECONDS] He made

436
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,620
a lot of money, but if somebody
would come in and would offer

437
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,020
him a apartment building, a
hundred-unit apartment building

438
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,531
for a good price,
then he would buy it.

439
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,030
INT: Great.

440
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,760
PF: And, ant that's how
I could describe him.

441
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,800
He was a very creative person.

442
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,040
And-- [PAUSES FOR 5 SECONDS]

443
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,845
But he also took
a lot of chances

444
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:18,880
in, in-- he never
lost his money,

445
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,910
but he took a lot of chances
in his business dealings.

446
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,075
So he was under
tremendous pressure,

447
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:33,080
[PAUSES FOR 4 SECONDS]
in-- I could see.

448
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,520
INT: Thank you.

449
00:29:35,520 --> 00:30:34,329
