easier for me to say

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.424 align:middle line:90%
Zhetel than Zdzieciol.

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
weren't going to town with
[INAUDIBLE] something.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, there was
also a Yiddish [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%

SANDY HAYDEN: And--
and your father--

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:22.519 align:middle line:84%
your father let you associate
with all the other Jewish boys,

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:90%

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:90%

children and study
with them [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.514 align:middle line:84%
while other children were
playing football or something

00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But we had to obli--
oblige to our parents and--

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.941 align:middle line:84%
and, uh, and do it for
them because, uh, we

00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:50.966 align:middle line:90%
always suspected our parents.

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:90%

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And so did he sell it-- did
he sell it in-- in the town,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or did he take it to
the bigger cities?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
He sold it in the
town to someone

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:90%
who used to buy from everybody.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Also, he used to deal with--

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.432 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:90%
what was it called?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Mushrooms.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Dried mushrooms like--
and all kinds of--

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of the-- the farmers
used to sell in the city.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So he used to deal
with all sorts of produce then?

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And your mother?

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.689 align:middle line:90%
Can you--

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Just a housewife.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.855 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you-- can you
describe your mother?

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:90%
What you remember.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Very educated and, uh,
like a Jewish mother,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:90%
used to just oblige--

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.042 align:middle line:84%
do the housework and, uh,
and raise the children.

00:07:50.042 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Like a real good Jewish mother.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Good
Jewish mother, yeah.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And did you have
quite a bit of family,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%
cousins, and aunts, and uncles?

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.152 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we had.

00:08:02.152 --> 00:08:09.212 align:middle line:84%
Um, not far from our house
my-- my mother's sister

00:08:09.212 --> 00:08:13.848 align:middle line:84%
and her family,
they all perished.

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And my father's family
was in another city.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It's called [INAUDIBLE]
oh, about 100 kilometers

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.900 align:middle line:90%
from us towards, uh, Pinsk.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.869 align:middle line:84%
And he had a brother, and
sisters, and a mother.

00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:36.728 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, it was only
once in my life in that town

00:08:36.728 --> 00:08:37.853 align:middle line:90%
where my father comes from.

00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.895 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I was only
eight, nine years old.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: So they did--

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I remember it
very vaguely about that town.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: So you much--

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:84%
really, you had
much more contact

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
with your mother's
side of the family.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.096 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.435 align:middle line:84%
you used to spend all
holidays and celebrations?

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.833 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we used
to get together on holidays.

00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.204 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes in the middle
of the week, we used to--

00:09:04.204 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to play with my
cousins like a normal--

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:90%
normal way of--

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Of growing up.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.801 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: A fun
way of growing up, yes.

00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- the--

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:84%
the other 40% of
people who lived

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:90%
in the town, who were they?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Were they Poles?

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: A lot
of them were farmers.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And some were the, uh--
the administration--

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the Polish administration
like policeman--

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:90%
there was a magistrate.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like a city hall here.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And the, uh, the
mayor was a Pole.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And the secretaries were Poles.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, there was--
there wasn't a very big

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:90%
administration in our town.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.965 align:middle line:84%
But, uh, and-- and
enough Poles to--

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:90%
to collect taxes and--

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.832 align:middle line:90%
and look after all the, uh--

00:10:10.832 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Administration.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Administration
of the city, yeah.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.131 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So that's really
all that they did there,

00:10:16.131 --> 00:10:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and the Jews were--

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.197 align:middle line:84%
the Jews were involved in all
sorts of other professions

00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:21.696 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yeah, the Jews
were all kinds of professions.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Shoe-- shoemakers, fixing shoes,
and tailors, a lot of tailors,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and, uh, storekeepers, like
groceries and selling fabric.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
That was also developed
a lot in our town,

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
selling leather, leather
soles and leather--

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%
the shoes were made by hand.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's shoes
were made by hand.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.962 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: But there
was only one store--

00:10:57.962 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
while I was going up, I
remember started butter shoes.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And one store of
butter shoes opened up,

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
but until then,
there was no stores,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.586 align:middle line:90%
no shoes where they made shoes.

00:11:13.586 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, yeah.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.728 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: All made by hand.

00:11:16.728 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And-- and-- um, I
suppose that there

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.762 align:middle line:84%
were no Jews who were farmers
or landowners around the town.

00:11:25.762 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
there were a few

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
also had some farms,
not big ones, small--

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:90%
small farms.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So they were
allowed to own the land, and--

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And they
were doing the same

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.361 align:middle line:84%
as other farmers,
but not too many.

00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.142 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: There were in
the villages around the town,

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
there were quite a few
Jews in the farming,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:90%
like in the other--

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
peasant, non-Jews,
peasants, they also

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.484 align:middle line:84%
owned a couple of hectares
of land and lived from that.

00:12:00.484 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: But in
the town, there was--

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Mostly the
Jews were like professionals,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.879 align:middle line:90%
like shoemakers, and tailors.

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And a lot of
Jews were just starting--

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.365 align:middle line:84%
sitting and starting
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And what does-- what
were the relationships

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:84%
like between the Jews and
the Poles in the town?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: As a matter fact,
the relationship was very good.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah?

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Especially with
the white Russians in our town.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
The white Russians
were very nice to us.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
The Poles themselves
were anti-Semitic.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: They were?

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.517 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
experienced that right from--

00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.474 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: An early age.

00:12:48.474 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Since Hitler
came to power in 1933, the, uh,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Poles became different.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.617 align:middle line:90%
They were already anti-Semitic.

00:12:57.617 --> 00:12:58.575 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you--

00:12:58.575 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
can you remember in what
way they became different?

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:06.345 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, in the
last years in 1937, '38,

00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I remember they used to come
from bigger cities, young Poles

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and carrying placards
saying, don't buy from Jews

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:90%
and, uh, buy from Poles only.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And the anti-Semitism
started already to grow.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.365 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember-- do you
remember talking about it

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
as a young boy or hearing
your father and mother

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.474 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:13:34.474 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Were they worried
about it at all?

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, we all--

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:84%
we knew already what
actually from the papers,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
from the Jewish papers we
used to guess from, uh,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE],, like it was,
uh, produced in, uh, Warsaw.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:90%
We used to get these papers.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And we heard what going
on in German, what

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:90%
the Germans did to the Jews.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So we were already scared.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.556 align:middle line:84%
You were worried that that could
start happening in Poland also.

00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we were
very worried and scared

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
in the last few years
before the war broke out.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And even though the Jews were
the majority in your town, you

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.931 align:middle line:84%
still, the Poles were
still openly anti-Semitic.

00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:90%
They weren't scared of--

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: --of [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.045 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they were--
they were very anti-Semitic

00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:25.887 align:middle line:84%
openly, but not actually not
the local Poles, always--

00:14:25.887 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, always
Poles that came by.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.636 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Came by.

00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And they also planted, uh,
anti-Semitism into the Poles

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:90%
in our town.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But with the white
Russians, neighbors,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:90%
we lived in very peaceful.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And they were very nice.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So when-- when
did all of that start to change?

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: The last couple
of years, uh, before the war

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.339 align:middle line:84%
That-- wars, and
wars, and wars always.

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And with--
with the- white Russians

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and the Poles in the town
also or still just the people

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:90%
who were passing through?

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.659 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: The Poles.

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And some-- not too
many white Russians

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:84%
became already a little bit
also with a cold shoulder

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.022 align:middle line:90%
toward the Jews.

00:15:16.022 --> 00:15:21.808 align:middle line:84%
They were already, uh, showing
anti-Semitic, uh, tendencies.

00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:24.682 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And, um, can you--

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
can you describe what
happened, um, in 1939 when--

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.365 align:middle line:90%
when--

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, well,
when the war broke out,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:84%
when the Germans attacked
Poland, the Poles, a lot

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
of Polish, uh, soldiers were
running through our town

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%
towards Russia.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
They were escaping
from the Germans.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, the war broke out on
the 1st of September, 1939.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was the 17th of
September the Russians came in

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
from-- from Minsk,
from the other side

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and occupied our town.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And we came under the Russian
government and the Russian, uh,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.734 align:middle line:90%
occupation.

00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And
did things start

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.752 align:middle line:84%
to change very
much at that time?

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Changed--
it changed very--

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:90%
very rapidly, yes.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.614 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: How old
were you, um, when the--

00:16:32.614 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: In 1939?

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.321 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: 1939.

00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:90%
You mind me asking you?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I
was only 15 years old.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.944 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: 15 years old.

00:16:38.944 --> 00:16:39.386 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:16:39.386 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.095 align:middle line:84%
So you were a young-- you
were a young boy then?

00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Very young boy.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.603 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Do
you remember-- do

00:16:45.603 --> 00:16:46.977 align:middle line:84%
you remember some
of the feelings

00:16:46.977 --> 00:16:49.242 align:middle line:84%
that you had when-- when--
when the Russians occupied

00:16:49.242 --> 00:16:49.742 align:middle line:90%
your town?

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, when the
Russians came, I mean, we--

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.805 align:middle line:90%
we accepted them with open arms.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:55.680 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You mean rather than
have the Germans--

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.355 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

00:16:58.355 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We knew what the
Germans did to the Jews.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
And they-- they were
actually, uh, liberators.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:09.566 align:middle line:84%
And they behaved very
nice except some of the--

00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
from the rich Jews
took away the--

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:90%
their stores.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who had a fabric
store, other kinds of stores,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.050 align:middle line:90%
they confiscated it.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.655 align:middle line:84%
But they let the
people work for them,

00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
and they found
jobs for everybody.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And life went on fine.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: But
you were hearing--

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
you were hearing reports of
what was going on in Germany.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me what some of
the things that you heard in--

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: They used to
hear only from the paper

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:90%
what the Germans behaved--

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.121 align:middle line:84%
did bad to the Germans
Jews, also to the, uh--

00:17:52.121 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
when we heard the trouble
before the Russians came in.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
We knew what's going more
or less on in the paper.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians concealed
from us everything.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.175 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what's going
on in the other half of Poland.

00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:10.925 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really,
once they occupied--

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Once
they occupied,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.975 align:middle line:90%
we didn't know anything, just--

00:18:14.975 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
they told us what they
wanted to tell us.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So did--
did you feel at any time

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that you and your family
would like to escape or to go

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:90%
to another part of Europe?

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Or did you feel
that you would just

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.237 align:middle line:90%
stay their for the meantime?

00:18:28.237 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Even if you felt--

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:90%
but we couldn't do anything--

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.635 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: You
didn't have a chance.

00:18:32.635 --> 00:18:36.295 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: --because
the Russian policy was you,

00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
uh, if you are not with
us, you are against us.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
want to go away, you are--

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.613 align:middle line:90%
you are our enemy.

00:18:44.613 --> 00:18:45.363 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:47.216 align:middle line:84%
So that was dangerous
for you too.

00:18:47.216 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: So
we couldn't even

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.150 align:middle line:84%
think of escaping or
going anywhere then.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the
money to go too.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.832 align:middle line:90%
There was no-- nowhere to go.

00:18:58.832 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: But
when the Russians

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
came to occupy
[INAUDIBLE],, you must

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.562 align:middle line:84%
have been at you-- at yeshiva
in the neighboring town?

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Or had you come back in town.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I came back
to our town, because the, uh,

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Russians, they didn't exactly--

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:84%
they didn't say you
can do it, but so--

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
all the religious issues
disappeared somehow.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: The,
uh, officially,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
they didn't say you
cannot go to synagogue,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
because the Jews went
to synagogue while, uh--

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:90%
while they were in occupation.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the Jews
alone were afraid to do it.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:90%
So-- so yeshivas closed down?

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: There was no--
no more yeshivas at all.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we-- we um, had
to go to Russian schools

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:90%
to learn Russian.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you did
when you went back home.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: That's
what I did, yes.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were at-- at a school

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:90%
with Russians and Poles.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.849 align:middle line:84%
And it was now a
mix-- a mixed school.

00:20:02.849 --> 00:20:05.015 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Mixed, but
we-- we taught the subjects

00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:90%
that are only Russian.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.457 align:middle line:84%
We started a new
language altogether.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how was-- how was it

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:84%
going to a school
like that, because it

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
seems to be very different
from what you were used to?

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, uh, but we--

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
we could learn,
because the language

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
itself was, uh, was a lot easier
to catch, because the white--

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
white Russian is
similar to Russian.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Polish is also a bit
similar in a way.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And the-- the writing
and reading was harder,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
but the speaking, we
caught on very fast.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.864 align:middle line:84%
And how was it to be
in the class with, um,

00:20:44.864 --> 00:20:47.632 align:middle line:84%
with other children, with the
Russian and Polish children?

00:20:47.632 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you get on with them,
or was there anti-Semitism?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
No, no, there was
no anti-Semitism,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.105 align:middle line:84%
because, uh, they--
they knew that uh,

00:20:58.105 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:84%
the Russians in the
Russian government,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
there was no
anti-Semitism at all.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is the same.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they used to, uh,
punish for anti-Semitic, uh,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:90%
the writing--

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:90%
saying.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.642 align:middle line:90%
They, uh, used to--

00:21:18.642 --> 00:21:20.295 align:middle line:84%
people are afraid
to be anti-Semitic.

00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.359 align:middle line:84%
And the Poles also then
were afraid in school

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:90%
to be anti-Semitic.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
actually, the Poles,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
the few Poles that
were in our town

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, the ones that were
in the administration before.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:40.615 align:middle line:84%
And the-- the Polish
farmers behaved like, uh,

00:21:40.615 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
like they have to behave
under the Russian occupation.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.485 align:middle line:84%
So how many years was--
were you under occupation

00:21:48.485 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:90%
by the Russian forces?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, from
1939, from September 1939

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
till the outbreak of the
war at the 22nd of June,

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
1941 when Hitler
attacked Russia.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.729 align:middle line:90%
So that was two years.

00:22:06.729 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Nearly two years.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.046 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Right,
nearly two years, yeah.

00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Two years, yes.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.218 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And in a way, it
sounds like your life didn't

00:22:12.218 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:90%
change too much in those tears.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
The everyday living
didn't change too much.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.925 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, it
did change in, uh, in uh,

00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
the way that, from one
government to the other,

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
which, uh, the Russians had
started to, uh, put in us--

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
teach-- teach us-- teach us
their ways that you cannot be

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:41.325 align:middle line:84%
in the, uh, dealings or any,
uh, you cannot own a store.

00:22:41.325 --> 00:22:44.294 align:middle line:84%
You can-- you can't,
uh, be for your own.

00:22:44.294 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything has to be
for the government.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Now what you have
to work for the government.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was more
Marxist or socialist.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.315 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:22:53.315 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:90%
They tried to teach us.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.886 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't so easy to
absorb in the beginning.

00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, so that
was a bit difficult for--

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:90%
for all of you.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right,
but it was at least safe.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And was your father
able to continue

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.872 align:middle line:90%
doing what he had been doing?

00:23:08.872 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.705 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: What-- what--

00:23:10.705 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
what did he-- what
happened to his work then?

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: He, uh, he
used to buy, well, not

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same way as to--

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
before used to buy direct
from the farmers and--

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and sell it.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And here he had to work
for the government.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
He used to buy also
from the farmers,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:84%
but, uh, like in a
cooperative sort of.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:84%
He used to write down
everything he buys

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and, uh, pay out the farmers.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
He worked for the
government, in other words.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.661 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how-- how was that?

00:23:45.661 --> 00:23:47.327 align:middle line:90%
Was that a big change for him?

00:23:47.327 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: He got
used to it first.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.413 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:23:50.413 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:90%
But it was-- it was all right.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.464 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Before
that change, yeah.

00:23:53.464 --> 00:23:54.381 align:middle line:90%
But we got used to it.

00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.255 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:23:55.255 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Did that mean that,
materially, that you

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
had less in your family
than you were used to?

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
uh, a little bit less,

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't too bad.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.062 align:middle line:90%
It was enough to get by.

00:24:07.062 --> 00:24:07.826 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:24:07.826 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So food, and
clothing, and shoes,

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and all that sort of thing
during the Russian occupation

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
wasn't-- was that-- was
not too much of a problem.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%
You never--

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, it was
a problem, because it never

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:90%
brought in anything.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:90%
They took away.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Anything
that was produced,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
they took away from our
town and sent into Russia.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But, uh, we never
brought anything.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
If they did bring
something, you had

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to stand in, uh, a queue
for-- for hours to get it.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't complain.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It was-- they let us live.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
That was-- that was
the main good thing

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:90%
about the Russian occupation.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So you were just hoping that
that would continue right

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.727 align:middle line:90%
until--

00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: But then in 1941--

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941, when Hitler
attacked, uh, Russia, our city

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
was taken by the
Germans officially

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:90%
until the 8th of June, 1941.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was eight days later.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the eight
days, the, uh, there

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:28.265 align:middle line:84%
were some battles close to our
town with the, uh, the, uh,

00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Russians who were running
away with the Germans who

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
were coming as parachutists.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
The-- actually
they didn't take--

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the Germans didn't occupy
our town as a full army.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But, uh, the, uh, they
parachuted behind the town

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and attacked all the, uh,
running away trucks and, uh,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:90%
and tanks from the Russian.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.389 align:middle line:90%
So there was--

00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Eight days.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, so there
was fighting around your town

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:90%
for-- for eight days.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.806 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah, so
fighting about eight days.

00:26:06.806 --> 00:26:07.681 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:26:07.681 --> 00:26:09.885 align:middle line:84%
And what was it like
during those eight days.

00:26:09.885 --> 00:26:11.664 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
it was very bad.

00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:14.738 align:middle line:84%
The, uh, the Jews,
uh, not only do

00:26:14.738 --> 00:26:17.196 align:middle line:84%
the whole population couldn't
get out of the houses, hiding

00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:18.873 align:middle line:90%
in the houses.

00:26:18.873 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And they did get out
the, uh, the planes

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
shooting over the head,
the German planes.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, uh,
most people were hiding.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:90%
And you must-- do you rem--

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you must have been
very frightened about it.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:37.362 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
frightened, yes.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:39.112 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you
remember the feeling?

00:26:39.112 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
yes, I remember.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.149 align:middle line:84%
I used to hide even
in the basement.

00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: With
your whole family?

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: The whole family
for days till-- till the, uh,

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:54.296 align:middle line:84%
shooting got a little
bit, uh, eased.

00:26:54.296 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.462 align:middle line:84%
And during those
eight days, do you--

00:26:57.462 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you
worried about what

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen now
that the Russians had left?

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
the uh, we knew

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
that it's not so good that
the Germans occupied the, uh,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:84%
living will be, uh,
bad [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.745 align:middle line:90%
We knew what to expect.

00:27:16.745 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: You did know?

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Was this--

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
how hard-- how-- how did
you know this information,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:90%
because you--

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we knew what they do--

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:84%
they did in Germany
or in Poland.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:90%
So we knew what to expect.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And so it happened.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you-- can you
tell us what happened

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.124 align:middle line:84%
from the time the
Germans occupied?

00:27:35.124 --> 00:27:36.456 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:27:36.456 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The German soldiers,
they came in the town.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
They-- they were very careful
walking by houses singularly.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
They, uh, first
came in without--

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
without, uh, cars, or tanks,
or just occupied the city.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.595 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, immediately,
they started,

00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:84%
um, they started to
ask the, uh, some

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:90%
of the, uh, Polish or white--

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
or the-- or the
non-Jewish population

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.260 align:middle line:90%
where are-- where the Jews are.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And they asked for food from
the Jews and asked for bicycles.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And you
gave it all to them?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.305 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Everything.

00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: They had to, yeah.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.575 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: They
had no choice.

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: And they had--

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
right away, the Germans
had some of the, uh,

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of the town's inhabitants.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.886 align:middle line:84%
Some of them where they
with them, helping them,

00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
uh, showing them the
Jewish, uh, houses.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And they went and robbed,
and beat, and uh, and--

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the three days
after the, uh, they

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.140 align:middle line:84%
had already with them
some, um, placards

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:84%
hanging out in, uh, three
languages-- in German,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
in Russian, and,
uh, and uh, Polish.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.878 align:middle line:90%
All de-- decrees against Jews.

00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:17.753 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:29:17.753 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: That the Jews,
uh, cannot walk on the sidewalk.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
They cannot, uh,
possess, uh, fur coats.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
He cannot-- they
cannot have any gold.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They have to give it
away to the Germans--

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and a long list of
decrees against Jews.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So we knew right away
the trouble started.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, slowly, the Jews
started to come out of the--

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:90%
of the hiding.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And-- and, uh, the, uh, Germans
gave every day new orders

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
to, uh, collect food and
collect clothes for them.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And then in the, uh, third
week was in July the 5th.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: At that
time, had they, um,

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:90%
had there been any brutality?

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Had there been-- had
they killed any Jews

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:90%
during those three weeks?

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Or had they just beaten them up?

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: They killed--

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
they made like, um,
6 o'clock was curfew.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.412 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:30:35.412 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And nobody
could go-- get out

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.940 align:middle line:84%
of the house at 6
o'clock in the evening.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't evening yet.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So in several cases, some
Jews walked to one house

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.156 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:30:51.156 --> 00:30:52.031 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: After six of
them got shot right way.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
non-Jews weren't shot.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But Jews are shot
for-- for that.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:84%
That was the-- several
Jews were shot that way.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But then on the 15th of
July, the, uh, the uh,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:90%
order to make Judenrat.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they picked
10 of the best Jews from town

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and ordered them
to have a Judenrat

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and have a Jewish police.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.402 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, then the, uh,
the next day, the--

00:31:32.402 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you know--
you knew some of the people who

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.225 align:middle line:90%
were elected to the Judenrat?

00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the best, uh, the
best, uh, people from the city.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:49.390 align:middle line:84%
One was a lawyer called Alter
Dvoretsky was a young man.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:90%
He was very capable.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.970 align:middle line:84%
He was at the head
of the Judenrat

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:59.987 align:middle line:84%
and, uh, several of
religious Jews [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:59.987 --> 00:32:02.070 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So they--
they were all good people.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: All-- a
better class of people.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
the rabbi for our town

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:90%
was also included in that.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And the men on the
15h of July, it

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
was only two weeks
after they occup--

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.920 align:middle line:84%
they came in, they,
uh, sent the police

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to tell all the Jews to
come on the marketplace,

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:37.110 align:middle line:84%
to get on the market place
from the age of 16 to 60.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they said
officially 16 to 60,

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
but whenever they
caught younger ones,

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.720 align:middle line:84%
they also pushed
to the marketplace.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:90%
And, uh, on that--

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.350 align:middle line:84%
on that, uh, marketplace,
the Gestapo came in.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.690 align:middle line:84%
They had a-- a table
and the market chairs.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
big list of people

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:84%
who they called and said,
anybody will be called out

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.852 align:middle line:90%
should go forward.

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And that way,
they took away 120 people.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.306 align:middle line:90%
What sort of people were they?

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:90%
All men or--

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: All men and
the better-- the better

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.122 align:middle line:84%
class of people from the
city, and the-- and the

00:33:23.122 --> 00:33:32.610 align:middle line:84%
uh, the richer and, uh, more
learned, and they packed them

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.415 align:middle line:90%
in talks.

00:33:34.415 --> 00:33:35.790 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: How
do you-- how do

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.998 align:middle line:90%
you think they got that list?

00:33:36.998 --> 00:33:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Who gave them the list?

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: The, uh, the
list was helped by the, uh,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.960 align:middle line:84%
local, by local
collaborators to the Germans.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Who knew the people in
the-- the Jewish people.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: They
knew everybody.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
in [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
in the Hebrew school,
there was a janitor,

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.673 align:middle line:84%
and he could speak Yiddish
just as good as any Jew.

00:34:03.673 --> 00:34:04.440 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And he was
right away with the Germans

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and gave out all the Jews
who were, uh, known in the--

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:90%
in the town .

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, they took--
they said they

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:28.500 align:middle line:84%
are going to take this, uh, 120
people to work in Nowogrodek.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Nowogrodek is a bigger city than
us about 38 kilometers away.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.484 align:middle line:84%
But we found out later that they
were shot in the Nowogrodek.

00:34:40.484 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And when
did you find that out?

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.279 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we found out from--

00:34:46.279 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:90%
from peasants, which saw it.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.730 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So that was
the first really bad atrocity

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That was only two weeks
after they entered our town.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, the kids saw all
kinds of, uh, every day they

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:84%
demanded from us something
else, the Germans.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:21.204 align:middle line:84%
The, uh, or-- we organized
work like there was, uh,

00:35:21.204 --> 00:35:25.380 align:middle line:84%
a highway the Russians
started and didn't finish.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So they, uh, took
men who could-- well,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.560 align:middle line:84%
they were a little stronger
to work on that highway.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.731 align:middle line:84%
And I was also, uh,
working on that highway.

00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Because
then you were a young man.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:90%
You were 16, 17.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
young and strong, and--

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And
I wanted to leave,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and they gave out
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING GERMAN] means
some kind of a document.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:55.460 align:middle line:84%
There was-- it went
by the column more

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
stronger hard workers had

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:00.730 align:middle line:90%
a red [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Some had green
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:90%
And, uh, the people--

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:84%
the Jews were very,
uh, wanted very

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.074 align:middle line:90%
much to get [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:36:12.074 --> 00:36:12.573 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:36:12.573 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.330 align:middle line:90%
So you had-- you had a red one?

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I have a good
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, yes.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.290 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: You
had a good one.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: How were you
chosen to-- to go and work?

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.807 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I,
uh, actually, they

00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:84%
were asking for volunteers,
and, uh, I wanted for this job,

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:90%
so I worked on the--

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:84%
on the, uh, building
that highway.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:90%
And your brothers?

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.170 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: My
brother wasn't with me.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:84%
He was, uh-- he
was already taken--

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
before the at-- the
Germans attacked,

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.005 align:middle line:84%
he was taken to
the Russian Army.

00:36:50.005 --> 00:36:51.630 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: How--
who-- who took him?

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.136 align:middle line:84%
Was he conscripted
to the Russian Army?

00:36:54.136 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: No, no.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
He was already of age.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.030 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh, oh, I see.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.400 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: He
was born in 19--

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: So he was in--

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.148 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: 20.

00:37:00.148 --> 00:37:04.430 align:middle line:84%
He was 18 years old,
and he was taken legally

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.382 align:middle line:90%
to the Russian Army.

00:37:05.382 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: To
the Russian Army.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:90%
So had you-- did you keep--

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
manage to keep correspondence
with him during that time?

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.480 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: It wasn't very--

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:90%
it was right before the war.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.700 align:middle line:84%
All we heard-- we had only one
letter from him that is going

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.210 align:middle line:90%
into--

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.640 align:middle line:90%
deep into Russia.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.065 align:middle line:84%
And then we were
apart for six years.

00:37:26.065 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.773 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't know what
had happened to you.

00:37:28.773 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: We
found him in 1946.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.902 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:37:32.902 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- that must have
been very hard for your mother

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:90%
and father.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.952 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:37.418 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: It
would be really--

00:37:37.418 --> 00:37:38.820 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And your sister?

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.179 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:43.950 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: The sister was
the whole time with me together.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.230 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And then your younger brother.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:47.850 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
my younger sister.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.558 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Your
younger sister, sorry.

00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I didn't
tell [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:59.170 align:middle line:84%
She perished in, uh, in 1942
in August together the parents.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: So your father--

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.320 align:middle line:84%
when the Germans
came, your father

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.257 align:middle line:90%
stopped, um, working, and--

00:38:06.257 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.485 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: You were the
only one that was really,

00:38:09.485 --> 00:38:12.447 align:middle line:90%
um, working on the highway.

00:38:12.447 --> 00:38:14.030 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
the only one, yes.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: So-- what-- what--

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:84%
what were you getting
paid in any way?

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Did they feed you?

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.296 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they
didn't pay us anything.

00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:21.298 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Uh, the--

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the, uh, in 1941 on
November, the Germans

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:84%
told us to leave our houses
and go into a ghetto.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.730 align:middle line:90%
They made a ghetto.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.110 align:middle line:84%
The Jews themselves had to
make a fence, a wired fence,

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.940 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, uh, we
could only take with us

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.937 align:middle line:90%
whatever we could--

00:38:52.937 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Carry.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.603 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Carry.

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:55.550 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And
it happened that we

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.810 align:middle line:84%
had a big-- a very
big garden and used

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to have enough
potatoes to put it

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:84%
in a big hole covered
with earth and hide it

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:90%
for the next spring.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:84%
That was done actually
normal times too.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Right.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:28.380 align:middle line:84%
all the potato that we got from,
uh, before the winter came,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:90%
we bur--

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:90%
we buried it in the garden.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And, um, so in Spring
of 1942 in the ghetto,

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:90%
I had that chance I--

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.783 align:middle line:90%
to open that hole and--

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:46.532 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:39:46.532 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: --put in the
potatoes in the ghetto so we

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:90%
could have--

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Some food?

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Some
food for a while.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:59.160 align:middle line:84%
The whole-- the whole, uh, all
the inhabitants of that house,

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.842 align:middle line:90%
we shared.

00:40:00.842 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:84%
We used to bring in
like, uh, hiding it in--

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
in a way that the Germans
shouldn't see that they

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.401 align:middle line:90%
carried potatoes in this--

00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: How did
you-- how did you do that?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, we
into the night, at night,

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and brought it in.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The houses that the
Germans confiscated was--

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:84%
in the front of the house
was some sort of, uh--

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
uh, a list that,
uh, but this house

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.640 align:middle line:90%
is confiscated by the Germans.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:84%
In the front, they couldn't
get in, but from the back--

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: You could?

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI:
--you could get in.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't do anything.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:44.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Jewish houses
were occupied by--

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:90%
by, uh, local, uh, non-Jews.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.940 align:middle line:90%
But some of them are still--

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:84%
our house was still
empty standing there.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:53.920 align:middle line:90%
So you could sneak in at night.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.330 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I used
to sneak in every night

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and bring a little
bit of potatoes

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:90%
that I could carry myself.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: And that's--

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that's how we could
live for a while.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm And what
were the living conditions

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:90%
like in the ghetto?

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.095 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Very bad.

00:41:09.095 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.201 align:middle line:84%
Can you-- can you
describe it a little bit?

00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they
packed in in the house,

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in a little house, about 800
square feet or 900 square feet.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:26.067 align:middle line:84%
They packed in about 60 people,
one on top of the other.

00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And that's how
you and your family lived--

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:28.940 align:middle line:90%
lived with another--

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, yes.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.740 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: --50 people or so.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.100 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: In the
basement and on top on the--

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:40.360 align:middle line:84%
under the roof, people,
one on top of the other,

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and the conditions in the
ghetto was very bad, dirty,

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.252 align:middle line:90%
and no food.

00:41:46.252 --> 00:41:47.002 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:41:47.002 --> 00:41:49.180 align:middle line:90%
And-- and lice also.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.421 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:41:51.421 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And what--
what did the people,

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.730 align:middle line:84%
the leaders of the
ghetto, of the Judenrat,

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:90%
were they fair in the way they--

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.495 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they were
very fair, but they were also--

00:42:00.495 --> 00:42:05.470 align:middle line:84%
they had the same,
uh, goals we did.

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:08.940 align:middle line:84%
They were also afraid
of-- the Germans used them

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:90%
just to get their way.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:12.460 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, this
out-- this Alter Dvoretsky

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.480 align:middle line:90%
is from the Judenrat.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.890 align:middle line:84%
He organized a partisan
group in the ghetto.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who
could be of help--

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
used everybody that
could be of help.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Only the young
people he mobilized.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And myself was working in the
highway, building the highway.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.056 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to bring into
the ghetto parts, uh, weapons.

00:42:46.056 --> 00:42:47.720 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:53.402 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: So we used to
tie it in bundles of wood.

00:42:53.402 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So
they wouldn't see.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.242 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: To carry it in.

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, I used to take
chances to bring in parts

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.484 align:middle line:90%
of rifles and ammunition.

00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And from time to time,
the Germans used to check

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:90%
everybody-- every bundle of--

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.171 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Wood?

00:43:13.171 --> 00:43:16.265 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Of wood,
or on the person.

00:43:16.265 --> 00:43:19.359 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that was found with
something was shot right away.

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:21.150 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were lucky you never--

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I was lucky.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:22.610 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.276 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
frightening each time.

00:43:24.276 --> 00:43:25.680 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, I mean--

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, it's a risk.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.686 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I risked
with my life all the time.

00:43:28.686 --> 00:43:29.892 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:29.892 --> 00:43:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So you joined the partisan
group in the ghetto.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:33.250 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:33.869 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:34.660 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: 194--

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.590 align:middle line:90%
1941?

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.714 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941.

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:37.588 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:43:37.588 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: We organized the--

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:44.975 align:middle line:84%
in the basement, we used
to put together the rifles.

00:43:44.975 --> 00:43:46.100 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.296 align:middle line:90%
did you use them?

00:43:47.296 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:90%
What-- what-- what--

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.936 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I didn't
have a chance to use,

00:43:50.936 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and practically, nobody
had a chance, only--

00:43:54.750 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:84%
only a few young
boys, uh, were, uh,

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.449 align:middle line:84%
fighting against
them in the second--

00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
not in the second time when
the Germans killed the Jews.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.346 align:middle line:84%
The Germans killed,
uh, about half

00:44:12.346 --> 00:44:13.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Jewish population
in the ghettos

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:84%
they killed in 1941
till the end of April.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, I-- can you--

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.750 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:21.685 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you tell
me a little bit about--

00:44:21.685 --> 00:44:23.268 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was a very bad day.

00:44:23.268 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Then my parents were--

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:90%
got killed killed and my sister.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Uh, it was the 30th of
April, 1941, and the Germans,

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:41.786 align:middle line:84%
with the help [INAUDIBLE]
of the Ukrainian police,

00:44:41.786 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
so there were a few white
Russian police also surrounded

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.560 align:middle line:90%
the ghetto.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.504 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, very early in the
morning, about 5 o'clock

00:44:54.504 --> 00:44:56.670 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, they started
to knock on the windows

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and scream [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.655 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, they told
us to gather in

00:45:04.655 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:90%
that, uh, it was an old cem--

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Jewish cemetery
near the, uh, the

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.620 align:middle line:84%
synagogues and told
us to gather there,

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:90%
all the Jews should together.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And I came there.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:27.230 align:middle line:84%
We, uh-- they told us to
stand in families, each family

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.540 align:middle line:90%
together, all the families.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So I had that red
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.810 align:middle line:84%
which was considered
to be a good sign.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend who also
had a good [SPEAKING GERMAN],,

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
so I told him to take
my sister, saying

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that this wife and I wanted
to rescue my family, my father

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.055 align:middle line:90%
and mother.

00:45:53.055 --> 00:46:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember they started to
select the, uh, I showed him

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:01.170 align:middle line:90%
the [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So he said, [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
to the right, which was good.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And right after, a couple
steps from this Gestapo man,

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.470 align:middle line:84%
stood other Gestapo
people, looked

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:22.460 align:middle line:84%
at the [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
and they let me go through

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.225 align:middle line:84%
and apparently chased
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,

00:46:26.225 --> 00:46:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in other words--

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: To--
to the bad line.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.705 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: To--
to get killed.

00:46:31.705 --> 00:46:37.490 align:middle line:84%
They said to resettle for
labor or something else,

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.761 align:middle line:84%
but they took them
behind the town.

00:46:39.761 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And there was
nothing that you could do.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI:
Nothing I could do.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And my sister went
with that, uh,

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.920 align:middle line:84%
my friend who had a good
[SPEAKING GERMAN] too,

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.902 align:middle line:90%
and she was, uh, rescued.

00:46:54.902 --> 00:46:55.860 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Is that--

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.068 align:middle line:84%
that day must be a very hard
day for you to remember.

00:46:58.068 --> 00:47:00.450 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: A
very bad day, yeah.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:84%
They killed half of the
Jewish population in one day,

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and then they
shortened the ghetto.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.750 align:middle line:90%
They cut it in half.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:18.784 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the, uh, all
the edges around the ghetto,

00:47:18.784 --> 00:47:21.520 align:middle line:90%
and they told the Jews--

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:28.356 align:middle line:84%
for the Jews to put an
electric fence closer inside.

00:47:28.356 --> 00:47:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And I continued to
work on that highway.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.770 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN:
And-- and the Jews,

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:84%
your family and the other
Jews, were they taken?

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.804 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
they were taken.

00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.220 align:middle line:84%
They were led
through the streets.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:48.910 align:middle line:84%
They were taken behind the
town, and forced to undress,

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and the, uh, the graves
were already dug.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It was already ready,
and they shot 50 people

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.055 align:middle line:90%
at a time right--

00:48:01.055 --> 00:48:05.095 align:middle line:90%
right on top of the cliff.

00:48:05.095 --> 00:48:06.602 align:middle line:90%
They were all killed.

00:48:06.602 --> 00:48:08.560 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: What went
through your mind then?

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel like you wanted
to avenge their deaths?

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.640 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that's the only thing

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.820 align:middle line:90%
was in my mind to avenge.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I never believed
I'll stay alive.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But at least I should be
able to avenge for the--

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.110 align:middle line:90%
for what they did.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.314 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:48:26.314 --> 00:48:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Something that-- has that
stayed-- the feeling of it

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.146 align:middle line:90%
stayed with you?

00:48:29.146 --> 00:48:30.550 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I still--

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:90%
the feeling never changed.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't feel exactly the
same as I felt then, but I, uh,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:90%
had that feeling all the time.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.410 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and so
what happened after that day?

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:52.594 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the, uh,
the ghetto was shortened.

00:48:52.594 --> 00:48:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The Judenrat actually
was also killed.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:90%
They told to the Judenrat.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, they kept us
alive till August--

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:17.700 align:middle line:84%
August 6th, 1942,
and, uh, August 6th ,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.690 align:middle line:90%
1942 happened the same thing.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:27.230 align:middle line:84%
The-- the Germans and
the Ukrainian police

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:31.820 align:middle line:84%
surrounded-- surrounded
the, uh, the ghetto

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and chased everybody
out in the marketplace.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.235 align:middle line:84%
But, uh, at that
time, I didn't--

00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't run anymore to the--

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:84%
on the marketplace
we were hiding.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.740 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Who-- who is we?

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:90%
You?

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.013 align:middle line:90%
You and your sister.

00:49:47.013 --> 00:49:51.030 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: I, and my
sister, and my cousin,

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.310 align:middle line:90%
two cousins of mine.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:56.675 align:middle line:90%
We were hiding in a--

00:49:56.675 --> 00:50:03.190 align:middle line:84%
we-- we actually dug a
hiding place under the floor.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:10.310 align:middle line:84%
But being so close to the, uh,
ghetto gate of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:84%
was the Germans where, the
other side of the ghetto, they

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:20.444 align:middle line:90%
had their, uh, the officers.

00:50:20.444 --> 00:50:23.350 align:middle line:90%
We were afraid that close--

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:24.840 align:middle line:84%
close-- being
close to the ghetto

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:29.305 align:middle line:84%
would be a lot worse if
they start digging with

00:50:29.305 --> 00:50:33.900 align:middle line:90%
or searching with, uh, dogs.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.590 align:middle line:90%
So we were running--

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.300 align:middle line:84%
we were running in a
place where my cousin

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.680 align:middle line:90%
was working as a carpenter.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And the-- the-- it
was inside the ghetto.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:84%
You could get in from inside
and from outside the ghetto.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The, uh-- in other words,
the, uh, there was--

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.010 align:middle line:84%
the back of the building
was inside the ghetto.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:04.170 align:middle line:84%
The front of the building
was out of the ghetto.

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So we were running there
and running-- and hiding

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:08.650 align:middle line:90%
in the basement.

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:13.140 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a
dark place to hide,

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but a plain, little basement
and a tiny, little window.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And we got into the basement
and about 15 people there.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Some came also running
at that the place.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.690 align:middle line:84%
We are hiding there a whole day,
and through the little window,

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:90%
you could see that--

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:40.150 align:middle line:84%
the way the Germans chased
the Jews to the marketplace

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and beating them.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:50.753 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, towards evening, at
night, we tried to get to--

00:51:50.753 --> 00:51:54.430 align:middle line:84%
we tried to get out of there,
because we knew we cannot stay

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:57.570 align:middle line:90%
there overnight.

00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:02.735 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, somehow everybody
wants to get out first

00:52:02.735 --> 00:52:07.962 align:middle line:84%
and started to commotion
inside when the,

00:52:07.962 --> 00:52:14.010 align:middle line:84%
uh, the Germans with the
Lithuanians and the Ukrainians

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:20.590 align:middle line:84%
were all helping the Germans,
uh, in the gathering the Jews.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.682 align:middle line:84%
They heard noise
in the building.

00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And they, uh, first opened
the door, and they caught us.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, my cousin
was a carpenter and I

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:90%
started to beg the Germans as--

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.036 align:middle line:90%
let us live.

00:52:38.036 --> 00:52:40.210 align:middle line:90%
I-- I could carpent--

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.310 align:middle line:90%
I can.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So the German
answered, yeah, yeah.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.412 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, we will take
you to the new house.

00:52:50.412 --> 00:52:53.405 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we knew that
they were going to shoot us.

00:52:53.405 --> 00:52:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And they pushed us in
back into the basement

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and put a heavy
table on top of it.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, outside they put
a post working, watching,

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:84%
watching the uh, the outside
in the little window.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But to our-- to
our luck, the posts

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:24.250 align:middle line:84%
sat down close to the
window and fell asleep.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And the, uh, the window
was too small for anybody

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.290 align:middle line:90%
to get-- to crawl through.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So we-- we stretched out all
the cement around the window

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and made a bigger hole, and
slowly, we took out the shoes,

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:42.950 align:middle line:90%
and slowly we--

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:44.270 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Escaped, yeah.

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: We, uh,
called out, and we, uh,

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.707 align:middle line:90%
said that we'll--

00:53:49.707 --> 00:53:53.780 align:middle line:90%
we'll meet right in, uh, that.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.470 align:middle line:84%
A little river was
running close by,

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and we said we shouldn't
walk with the streets.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:05.780 align:middle line:84%
We should, uh, go with the
river, which takes us out

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.930 align:middle line:84%
in the outskirts of
the-- of the town.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:10.492 align:middle line:90%
And that way, we--

00:54:10.492 --> 00:54:12.310 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: So
you all escaped.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:14.320 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Not all.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.760 align:middle line:90%
An older woman couldn't make it.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Two-- two people still, because
they found only two people

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:90%
there in the--

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.936 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.
in the morning.

00:54:23.936 --> 00:54:27.350 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: --in the
basement the next day.

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They escaped, and we wandered
around for, um, for, um,

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.680 align:middle line:90%
until--

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:41.040 align:middle line:90%
until it got, uh, light.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.695 align:middle line:84%
They escaped, my sister,
and I, and my two cousins

00:54:44.695 --> 00:54:51.340 align:middle line:84%
were running together, and
they came not very far.

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:84%
They ran away about 10
kilometers out of town.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And it was already light.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:03.590 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't walk any further,
so we were hiding a little--

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:06.408 align:middle line:90%
the little forest was very--

00:55:06.408 --> 00:55:09.880 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't-- it was a very
dangerous place to stay.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.630 align:middle line:90%
But we crawled into a bush.

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.860 align:middle line:90%
We were hiding there.

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And the shepherds could--

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.580 align:middle line:84%
uh, we could see the
shepherds in the morning.

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we are lucky
that nobody noticed us

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:28.770 align:middle line:90%
the whole day.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So the next evening,
we were trying

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:40.900 align:middle line:84%
to get food into the
forest, because the, uh,

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:46.205 align:middle line:84%
the forest around our
town was only about,

00:55:46.205 --> 00:55:50.029 align:middle line:90%
uh, 4 to 20 kilometers away.

00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Were you planning
then to join partisan groups?

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.480 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that was the main idea,

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.610 align:middle line:90%
to join the partisans.

00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, the next night, we
came towards the, uh, forest

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.150 align:middle line:90%
where the partisans were.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But talking to a peasant,
we knocked on the door,

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and eh opened the door
to us, and he said--

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:23.930 align:middle line:84%
he gave us bad news that
the Russian partisans are--

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:29.480 align:middle line:84%
they are anti-Semitic, and they
killed some Jewish partisans,

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.040 align:middle line:84%
which was the leader,
Alter Dvoretsky.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:41.950 align:middle line:84%
He was killed, and he suggested
we should go into, uh,

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:45.422 align:middle line:84%
there was a [SPEAKING GERMAN]
like a working--

00:56:45.422 --> 00:56:51.160 align:middle line:84%
uh, it was a camp, which
was about 30 kilometers

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.930 align:middle line:84%
from our town, and the town
was called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:55.930 --> 00:57:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, there the Germans
need these people, the Jews,

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to build for them an airport.

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was a chance to stay
alive as that farmer suggested.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And we took his advice, and
we went towards that, uh,

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:18.220 align:middle line:90%
camp, which was--

00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.850 align:middle line:84%
together was about 33
kilometers to make.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So to the next,
towards [INAUDIBLE],,

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:34.390 align:middle line:84%
we went around our town
towards that, uh, camp.

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:38.381 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
we came-- we came--

00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:40.210 align:middle line:90%
we finally came to that camp.

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.410 align:middle line:84%
We joined a group
of Jewish workers,

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:45.560 align:middle line:90%
and we got into that camp.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Our feet were swollen,
because we were always

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.710 align:middle line:90%
walking barefoot.

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.970 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: And hungry.

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.890 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: And hungry.

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But the conditions in that
camp was just terrible.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.780 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.880 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: It was summer.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:90%
People slept under the sky.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.870 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:08.970 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh,
there was very little food.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And people had to carry stones
from one place to the other

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:14.026 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:58:14.026 --> 00:58:18.775 align:middle line:90%
to, uh, build that airport.

00:58:18.775 --> 00:58:25.829 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, the, uh, we couldn't
work here, because we--

00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:26.620 align:middle line:90%
our feet were all--

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.578 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Was sore.

00:58:27.578 --> 00:58:29.620 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: --were
beaten and swollen.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.075 align:middle line:84%
So but they forced
us to go to work.

00:58:33.075 --> 00:58:36.280 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: Who-- were these
not Germans again or Russians?

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:40.630 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
the, uh, the people

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.950 align:middle line:84%
who watched us were
actually Ukrainians.

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And there were Jewish police.

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:52.660 align:middle line:84%
The Germans always had this
streak to-- the-- to have

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.410 align:middle line:90%
their--

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.545 align:middle line:84%
their own-- their
own people to--

00:58:56.545 --> 00:58:58.990 align:middle line:90%
to do the bad job.

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So the Jewish police would
chase down the Jews to work.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they had to.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.353 align:middle line:90%
They had no choice.

00:59:06.353 --> 00:59:07.103 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:59:07.103 --> 00:59:08.410 align:middle line:90%
So you-- you--

00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:11.820 align:middle line:84%
you are sympathetic to their
position, the Jewish police.

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.376 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel any--

00:59:14.376 --> 00:59:16.970 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they didn't
do anything that they could help

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:17.470 align:middle line:90%
it .

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
actually in the partisans,

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.580 align:middle line:84%
were running away to
the partisans together.

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.056 align:middle line:90%
But, uh, they had no choice.

00:59:26.056 --> 00:59:28.730 align:middle line:84%
They were appointed
by the Germans,

00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and they to do what the
Germans told them to do.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And, uh, finally by--

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.520 align:middle line:84%
by being there about
three weeks, we did--

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.310 align:middle line:90%
I, for example, had to--

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:49.160 align:middle line:84%
was chased out to go to work
on the carrying the stones.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for a way
to go back to the partisans

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.440 align:middle line:90%
till I--

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.330 align:middle line:90%
one day, I found--

00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:01.155 align:middle line:84%
I noticed someone who I
knew went to the forest

01:00:01.155 --> 01:00:06.260 align:middle line:84%
yet before the slaughter
of the Jews in our town.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I talked to
him, and we met up,

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.840 align:middle line:84%
they said that he
came to pick up Jews

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:20.590 align:middle line:90%
from this camp to the forest.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:23.995 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a
[INAUDIBLE],, a map how to--

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.120 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: To get there.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.630 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: Go around.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Not to go to villages or to, uh,
in other words, to be careful

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
not to fall into certain,
uh, certain peasants who

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.995 align:middle line:90%
helped the Germans.

01:00:42.995 --> 01:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, and, uh,
one-- one evening,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.000 align:middle line:90%
instead of going back to the--

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
the ghetto, there
was also a ghetto

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.246 align:middle line:84%
in that camp, sort of a
ghetto, I stayed behind a--

01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:02.770 align:middle line:90%
a hump of stones.

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And, uh, we left that camp.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: You, and
your sister, and cousins.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: My sister
and my two cousins.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.910 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: And
another two, six of us,

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and we made it during
the night to the forest.

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:22.540 align:middle line:90%
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we finished
the first half of the tape.

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:26.150 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.940 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: They are going
to rewind it and then--

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:28.620 align:middle line:90%
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.517 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: --we
can start from the--

01:01:30.517 --> 01:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, in
the [INAUDIBLE] forest.

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
SANDY HAYDEN: In a
few minutes, yeah.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.268 align:middle line:90%
