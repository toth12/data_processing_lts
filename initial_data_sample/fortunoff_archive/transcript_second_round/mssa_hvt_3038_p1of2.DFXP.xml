        So the next evening,<br/>
        we were trying

        to get food into the<br/>

        the forest around our<br/>

        SANDY HAYDEN: Were you planning<br/>

        RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br/>

      <p begin="00:55:54.48" end="00:55:56.61" style="1">

        And, uh, the next night, we<br/>

      <p begin="00:56:04.72" end="00:56:07.15" style="1">
        where the partisans were.

      <p begin="00:56:07.15" end="00:56:14.11" style="1">
        But talking to a peasant,<br/>
        we knocked on the door,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:56:14.11" end="00:56:17.23" style="1">
        and eh opened the door<br/>

      <p begin="00:56:17.23" end="00:56:23.93" style="1">
        he gave us bad news that<br/>

        they are anti-Semitic, and they<br/>

        He was killed, and he suggested<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:56:41.95" end="00:56:45.42" style="1">
        there was a [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.42" end="00:56:51.16" style="1">
        uh, it was a camp, which<br/>
        was about 30 kilometers

      <p begin="00:56:51.16" end="00:56:55.93" style="1">
        from our town, and the town<br/>

        And, uh, there the Germans<br/>
        need these people, the Jews,

      <p begin="00:57:01.15" end="00:57:04.33" style="1">

        And it was a chance to stay<br/>

      <p begin="00:57:10.72" end="00:57:14.26" style="1">
        And we took his advice, and<br/>
        we went towards that, uh,

      <p begin="00:57:14.26" end="00:57:18.22" style="1">
        camp, which was--

        together was about 33<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:57:21.85" end="00:57:27.49" style="1">
        So to the next,<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:57:27.49" end="00:57:34.39" style="1">
        we went around our town<br/>

      <p begin="00:57:38.38" end="00:57:40.21" style="1">
        we finally came to that camp.

      <p begin="00:57:40.21" end="00:57:42.41" style="1">
        We joined a group<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:57:42.41" end="00:57:45.56" style="1">
        and we got into that camp.

        Our feet were swollen,<br/>

        But the conditions in that<br/>

        People slept under the sky.

      <p begin="00:58:08.97" end="00:58:13.21" style="1">
        And people had to carry stones<br/>

        And, uh, the, uh, we couldn't<br/>

        by being there about<br/>
