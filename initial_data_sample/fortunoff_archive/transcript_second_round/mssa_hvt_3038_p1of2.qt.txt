[00:00:00.00]


[00:00:16.46]
SANDY HAYDEN: OK, Holocaust
documentation project,
[00:00:19.94]
June 15, 1983.

[00:00:22.01]
I'm Sandy Hayden interviewing
Mr. Rubin Pinski.
[00:00:26.67]
Um, Mr. Pinski, um, you were
born in a little town in P--
[00:00:32.91]
Poland.

[00:00:33.41]
Can you tell us what the
name of the town was?
[00:00:35.29]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, the
name of town is Zdzieciol.
[00:00:37.23]
SANDY HAYDEN: Zdzieciol.

[00:00:37.83]
RUBIN PINSKI: In Polish.

[00:00:38.61]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:00:39.48]
RUBIN PINSKI: In
Russian, it was Dyatlovo.
[00:00:41.96]
SANDY HAYDEN: Dyatlovo.

[00:00:43.04]
RUBIN PINSKI: And well-known
in the Yiddish name, Zhetel.
[00:00:46.99]
SANDY HAYDEN: Zhetel.

[00:00:48.60]
So how-- how do you--
how do you refer to it?
[00:00:51.02]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, among
friends and among, uh, people,
[00:00:55.03]
call it Zhetel <<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:00:56.29]
SANDY HAYDEN: OK, so can
we call it-- can we call it
[00:00:59.79]
Zhetel during the interview?

[00:01:00.96]
I think--

[00:01:01.65]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I think--

[00:01:02.11]
SANDY HAYDEN: A little
easier for me to say
[00:01:03.50]
Zhetel than Zdzieciol.

[00:01:04.42]
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, well,
it's a very well-known town.
[00:01:07.40]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, and
um, on the map here, it--
[00:01:10.82]
you explained that to me
a little earlier on that
[00:01:14.07]
it's, um, it has a
number of big cities--
[00:01:17.20]
RUBIN PINSKI: Big cities around
it, yes, which is <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:01:23.46]
And, uh, we are also west
of, uh, <<INAUDIBLE>>----
[00:01:28.04]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

[00:01:28.90]
RUBIN PINSKI: --about 150
kilometers between <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:01:33.13]
Uh, our town, Zhetel,
was, uh, city's leader.
[00:01:36.38]
It's also well-known city.

[00:01:39.31]
On the other side
towards Minsk was, uh,
[00:01:43.76]
city in the name of <<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:01:45.36]
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, and did-- did
[00:01:47.76]
you used to travel
often to these cities?
[00:01:50.40]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, not often.

[00:01:51.89]
I was very young.

[00:01:52.82]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:01:53.70]
RUBIN PINSKI: I was just,
uh, uh, school, uh, child.
[00:01:57.23]
So I didn't have a chance
to travel too much.
[00:02:00.25]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

[00:02:01.12]
And how big was-- how many
people were-- were in--
[00:02:03.62]
in Zhetel?

[00:02:04.56]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the
whole population was only
[00:02:07.68]
about, uh, 7,500 to 8,000.

[00:02:10.96]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

[00:02:11.93]
RUBIN PINSKI: And at least
60% of them are Jews.
[00:02:15.20]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

[00:02:16.07]
So you-- you felt that
it was more Jewish--
[00:02:19.67]
you felt the Jewish community
very strongly there.
[00:02:22.13]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:02:22.51]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:02:22.89]
And was sort of Jewish
community was it?
[00:02:25.01]
Was it orthodox or?

[00:02:26.62]
RUBIN PINSKI:
Well, of all kinds.
[00:02:28.26]
Um, the, uh, the youth were
very-- very Zionist-minded.
[00:02:34.49]
There was <<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>
in our town.
[00:02:38.09]
The extreme right,
<<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>..
[00:02:43.48]
There are also
<<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>,,
[00:02:45.65]
which is socialist.

[00:02:48.32]
Some very few communist
youth, all kinds
[00:02:52.76]
of, uh, organizations.

[00:02:55.03]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

[00:02:56.48]
And was your family attached
to any organization?
[00:02:59.22]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, my
father was religious.
[00:03:01.49]
SANDY HAYDEN: He
was religious, yeah.
[00:03:03.03]
SANDY HAYDEN: And
along <<INAUDIBLE>>
[00:03:05.42]
to <<INAUDIBLE>> Israel.

[00:03:06.98]
This is a religious
organization.
[00:03:10.44]
And I-- I finished
<<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>..
[00:03:14.88]
And, uh, also <<? learning ?>>
in <<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>,,
[00:03:20.06]
which it was called.

[00:03:21.46]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

[00:03:22.39]
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, then I--

[00:03:25.23]
when I was 13, I was
<<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>..
[00:03:30.02]
It was not far from
our town, another town
[00:03:33.17]
called <<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:03:35.20]
They had a <<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>
on the, uh,
[00:03:40.09]
it was called
<<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>> from
[00:03:42.33]
<<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>.

[00:03:44.51]
And I was there till--

[00:03:46.31]
till 1939.

[00:03:47.57]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

[00:03:48.77]
So you-- you had-- you had
really a religious upbringing
[00:03:51.79]
then?

[00:03:52.28]
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
religious, yes.
[00:03:53.70]
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and your
early schooling was just
[00:03:57.26]
at in the <<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>
with other young Jewish boys
[00:04:00.91]
like you?

[00:04:01.42]
RUBIN PINSKI:
<<INAUDIBLE>> once, yes.
[00:04:02.92]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:04:03.79]
And-- and you learned
all the subjects--
[00:04:05.52]
arithmetic and
reading and writing.
[00:04:07.31]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, this we
learned because the school was
[00:04:11.36]
subsidized by the government.

[00:04:13.27]
And we had to do
it to a half a day.
[00:04:16.97]
And all these other--

[00:04:18.39]
other subjects mainly
was <<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>..
[00:04:25.25]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

[00:04:26.12]
So that was-- half the day was--

[00:04:28.58]
was-- was, um, school.

[00:04:30.03]
And the half-- other half
of the day was religious.
[00:04:32.15]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:04:32.59]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:04:33.61]
And did you, as a young
boy, did you enjoy that?
[00:04:36.06]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

[00:04:36.49]
I--

[00:04:36.74]
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, he did.

[00:04:37.43]
You just never-- he never
thought, oh, I don't really
[00:04:39.65]
like going.

[00:04:40.46]
Or it wasn't too-- it-- it
wasn't-- you didn't see other
[00:04:44.42]
Jewish boys who maybe had half
the afternoon free because they
[00:04:48.02]
weren't going to town with
<<INAUDIBLE>> something.
[00:04:50.47]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, there was
also a Yiddish <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:04:54.44]
And <<INAUDIBLE>>,, as I
said, <<NON-ENGLISH SPEECH>>..
[00:04:57.48]
Hebrew only.

[00:04:59.51]
And, uh, the youth
used to get together,
[00:05:02.08]
and we had
discussions for hours,
[00:05:04.46]
had the discussions,
one with another.
[00:05:06.64]
<<INAUDIBLE>> religious
youth and the--
[00:05:09.42]
SANDY HAYDEN: Zionists, yeah.

[00:05:10.85]
RUBIN PINSKI: The-- the
other real nice gathering
[00:05:15.24]
<<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:05:16.19]
SANDY HAYDEN: And--
and your father--
[00:05:18.48]
your father let you associate
with all the other Jewish boys,
[00:05:22.52]
even if they weren't religious?

[00:05:23.81]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

[00:05:23.95]
SANDY HAYDEN: That wasn't--

[00:05:25.08]
RUBIN PINSKI: It was, uh,
a habit that Saturday.
[00:05:28.12]
My father used to
take, uh, the, uh,
[00:05:32.24]
children and study
with them <<INAUDIBLE>>
[00:05:35.57]
while other children were
playing football or something
[00:05:38.51]
like that.

[00:05:39.54]
But we had to obli--
oblige to our parents and--
[00:05:45.56]
and, uh, and do it for
them because, uh, we
[00:05:48.94]
always suspected our parents.

[00:05:50.97]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

[00:05:52.68]
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

[00:05:53.59]
Saturdays, we used to see people
study with our <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:05:56.16]
SANDY HAYDEN: With your father.

[00:05:57.45]
RUBIN PINSKI:
Father <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:05:59.20]
SANDY HAYDEN: And how many--
how many were in your family?
[00:06:02.39]
RUBIN PINSKI: Four.

[00:06:03.18]
SANDY HAYDEN: Four.

[00:06:04.11]
Can you tell-- were
you the oldest, or--
[00:06:06.99]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I
was the third one.
[00:06:08.65]
SANDY HAYDEN: The third one.

[00:06:09.98]
RUBIN PINSKI: My
sister was the oldest.
[00:06:11.84]
I had a brother and myself,
and I had a younger sister,
[00:06:15.42]
which perished in the--

[00:06:19.68]
in 1942.

[00:06:20.80]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:06:22.61]
And, um, what-- what did your
father do as a profession?
[00:06:26.81]
RUBIN PINSKI: He used to buy
grain from the farmers, grain
[00:06:31.62]
and, uh, other things and sell
it in, uh, a bigger wholesale.
[00:06:40.93]
He used-- in other words, he
used to buy it from the farmers
[00:06:43.57]
to sell it in the--

[00:06:45.63]
in the bigger-- in
the bigger wholesale.
[00:06:48.33]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:06:49.08]
And so did he sell it-- did
he sell it in-- in the town,
[00:06:51.68]
or did he take it to
the bigger cities?
[00:06:53.80]
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

[00:06:54.99]
He sold it in the
town to someone
[00:06:57.81]
who used to buy from everybody.

[00:07:00.71]
Also, he used to deal with--

[00:07:02.69]


[00:07:05.43]
what was it called?

[00:07:08.56]
Mushrooms.

[00:07:10.11]
Dried mushrooms like--
and all kinds of--
[00:07:14.84]
all sorts of the-- the farmers
used to sell in the city.
[00:07:20.34]
SANDY HAYDEN: So he used to deal
with all sorts of produce then?
[00:07:23.79]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:07:24.84]
SANDY HAYDEN: And your mother?

[00:07:26.09]
Can you--

[00:07:26.69]
RUBIN PINSKI: Just a housewife.

[00:07:27.98]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:07:28.86]
Can you-- can you
describe your mother?
[00:07:31.39]
What you remember.

[00:07:32.58]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:07:34.12]
Very educated and, uh,
like a Jewish mother,
[00:07:40.90]
used to just oblige--

[00:07:44.54]
do the housework and, uh,
and raise the children.
[00:07:50.04]


[00:07:52.95]
Like a real good Jewish mother.

[00:07:54.34]
SANDY HAYDEN: Good
Jewish mother, yeah.
[00:07:56.65]
And did you have
quite a bit of family,
[00:07:58.90]
cousins, and aunts, and uncles?

[00:08:00.43]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:08:01.18]
Yes, we had.

[00:08:02.15]
Um, not far from our house
my-- my mother's sister
[00:08:09.21]
and her family,
they all perished.
[00:08:13.85]
And my father's family
was in another city.
[00:08:17.22]
It's called <<INAUDIBLE>>
oh, about 100 kilometers
[00:08:22.15]
from us towards, uh, Pinsk.

[00:08:26.90]
And he had a brother, and
sisters, and a mother.
[00:08:31.87]
As a matter of fact, it was only
once in my life in that town
[00:08:36.73]
where my father comes from.

[00:08:37.85]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:08:38.82]
RUBIN PINSKI: I was only
eight, nine years old.
[00:08:40.90]
SANDY HAYDEN: So they did--

[00:08:42.02]
RUBIN PINSKI: I remember it
very vaguely about that town.
[00:08:45.65]
SANDY HAYDEN: So you much--

[00:08:46.84]
really, you had
much more contact
[00:08:48.22]
with your mother's
side of the family.
[00:08:50.11]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:08:51.10]
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

[00:08:52.22]
you used to spend all
holidays and celebrations?
[00:08:55.43]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we used
to get together on holidays.
[00:08:57.83]


[00:09:01.27]
And sometimes in the middle
of the week, we used to--
[00:09:04.20]
I used to play with my
cousins like a normal--
[00:09:10.86]
normal way of--

[00:09:12.74]
SANDY HAYDEN: Of growing up.

[00:09:14.03]
RUBIN PINSKI: A fun
way of growing up, yes.
[00:09:16.80]
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- the--

[00:09:18.22]
the other 40% of
people who lived
[00:09:21.30]
in the town, who were they?

[00:09:23.73]
Were they Poles?

[00:09:25.05]
RUBIN PINSKI: A lot
of them were farmers.
[00:09:29.20]
And some were the, uh--
the administration--
[00:09:34.00]
the Polish administration
like policeman--
[00:09:37.82]
there was a magistrate.

[00:09:39.16]
It's like a city hall here.

[00:09:42.20]
And the, uh, the
mayor was a Pole.
[00:09:47.53]
And the secretaries were Poles.

[00:09:51.41]
And, uh, there was--
there wasn't a very big
[00:09:55.39]
administration in our town.

[00:09:58.63]
But, uh, and-- and
enough Poles to--
[00:10:02.97]
to collect taxes and--

[00:10:07.09]
and look after all the, uh--

[00:10:10.83]
SANDY HAYDEN: Administration.

[00:10:12.04]
RUBIN PINSKI: Administration
of the city, yeah.
[00:10:13.84]
SANDY HAYDEN: So that's really
all that they did there,
[00:10:16.13]
and the Jews were--

[00:10:18.76]
the Jews were involved in all
sorts of other professions
[00:10:21.20]
<<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:10:21.70]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yeah, the Jews
were all kinds of professions.
[00:10:25.78]
Shoe-- shoemakers, fixing shoes,
and tailors, a lot of tailors,
[00:10:34.87]
and, uh, storekeepers, like
groceries and selling fabric.
[00:10:42.22]
That was also developed
a lot in our town,
[00:10:45.31]
selling leather, leather
soles and leather--
[00:10:49.69]
the shoes were made by hand.

[00:10:51.49]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:10:52.24]
Really?

[00:10:53.01]
Everybody's shoes
were made by hand.
[00:10:55.03]
RUBIN PINSKI: But there
was only one store--
[00:10:57.96]
while I was going up, I
remember started butter shoes.
[00:11:02.89]
And one store of
butter shoes opened up,
[00:11:08.59]
but until then,
there was no stores,
[00:11:11.74]
no shoes where they made shoes.

[00:11:13.59]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, yeah.

[00:11:14.71]
RUBIN PINSKI: All made by hand.

[00:11:16.73]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:11:18.36]
And-- and-- um, I
suppose that there
[00:11:21.64]
were no Jews who were farmers
or landowners around the town.
[00:11:25.76]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
there were a few
[00:11:27.22]
also had some farms,
not big ones, small--
[00:11:31.48]
small farms.

[00:11:32.12]
SANDY HAYDEN: So they were
allowed to own the land, and--
[00:11:34.88]
RUBIN PINSKI: And they
were doing the same
[00:11:36.63]
as other farmers,
but not too many.
[00:11:39.36]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:11:40.11]
RUBIN PINSKI: There were in
the villages around the town,
[00:11:44.14]
there were quite a few
Jews in the farming,
[00:11:49.22]
like in the other--

[00:11:51.53]
peasant, non-Jews,
peasants, they also
[00:11:54.48]
owned a couple of hectares
of land and lived from that.
[00:12:00.48]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:12:01.36]
RUBIN PINSKI: But in
the town, there was--
[00:12:03.52]
SANDY HAYDEN: <<INAUDIBLE>>

[00:12:04.96]
RUBIN PINSKI: Mostly the
Jews were like professionals,
[00:12:11.41]
like shoemakers, and tailors.

[00:12:14.88]
SANDY HAYDEN: <<INAUDIBLE>>

[00:12:15.92]
RUBIN PINSKI: And a lot of
Jews were just starting--
[00:12:19.27]
sitting and starting
<<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:12:21.37]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

[00:12:22.91]
And what does-- what
were the relationships
[00:12:25.21]
like between the Jews and
the Poles in the town?
[00:12:28.32]
RUBIN PINSKI: As a matter fact,
the relationship was very good.
[00:12:31.03]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah?

[00:12:32.33]
RUBIN PINSKI: Especially with
the white Russians in our town.
[00:12:36.67]
The white Russians
were very nice to us.
[00:12:40.37]
The Poles themselves
were anti-Semitic.
[00:12:42.99]
SANDY HAYDEN: They were?

[00:12:43.99]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:12:44.34]
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
experienced that right from--
[00:12:46.52]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:12:47.35]
SANDY HAYDEN: An early age.

[00:12:48.47]
RUBIN PINSKI: Since Hitler
came to power in 1933, the, uh,
[00:12:53.70]
Poles became different.

[00:12:56.29]
They were already anti-Semitic.

[00:12:57.62]
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you--

[00:12:58.58]
can you remember in what
way they became different?
[00:13:01.31]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, in the
last years in 1937, '38,
[00:13:06.35]
I remember they used to come
from bigger cities, young Poles
[00:13:13.66]
and carrying placards
saying, don't buy from Jews
[00:13:19.29]
and, uh, buy from Poles only.

[00:13:22.56]
And the anti-Semitism
started already to grow.
[00:13:25.97]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:13:27.37]
And do you remember-- do you
remember talking about it
[00:13:30.07]
as a young boy or hearing
your father and mother
[00:13:33.69]
talk about it.

[00:13:34.47]
Were they worried
about it at all?
[00:13:35.89]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, we all--

[00:13:37.33]
we knew already what
actually from the papers,
[00:13:41.52]
from the Jewish papers we
used to guess from, uh,
[00:13:44.91]
the <<INAUDIBLE>>,, like it was,
uh, produced in, uh, Warsaw.
[00:13:50.64]
We used to get these papers.

[00:13:52.33]
And we heard what going
on in German, what
[00:13:54.98]
the Germans did to the Jews.

[00:13:57.36]
So we were already scared.

[00:13:59.14]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:13:59.89]
You were worried that that could
start happening in Poland also.
[00:14:02.56]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we were
very worried and scared
[00:14:04.95]
in the last few years
before the war broke out.
[00:14:08.70]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:14:09.45]
And even though the Jews were
the majority in your town, you
[00:14:13.62]
still, the Poles were
still openly anti-Semitic.
[00:14:16.93]
They weren't scared of--

[00:14:17.93]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

[00:14:18.65]
SANDY HAYDEN: --of <<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:14:19.67]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they were--
they were very anti-Semitic
[00:14:22.05]
openly, but not actually not
the local Poles, always--
[00:14:25.89]
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, always
Poles that came by.
[00:14:27.72]
RUBIN PINSKI: Came by.

[00:14:28.64]
And they also planted, uh,
anti-Semitism into the Poles
[00:14:33.60]
in our town.

[00:14:36.01]
But with the white
Russians, neighbors,
[00:14:39.00]
we lived in very peaceful.

[00:14:42.30]
And they were very nice.

[00:14:46.16]
SANDY HAYDEN: So when-- when
did all of that start to change?
[00:14:50.10]
RUBIN PINSKI: The last couple
of years, uh, before the war
[00:14:53.16]
started.

[00:14:54.57]
That-- wars, and
wars, and wars always.
[00:14:58.34]
SANDY HAYDEN: And with--
with the- white Russians
[00:15:00.38]
and the Poles in the town
also or still just the people
[00:15:03.57]
who were passing through?

[00:15:04.66]
RUBIN PINSKI: The Poles.

[00:15:05.66]
And some-- not too
many white Russians
[00:15:08.64]
became already a little bit
also with a cold shoulder
[00:15:13.85]
toward the Jews.

[00:15:16.02]
They were already, uh, showing
anti-Semitic, uh, tendencies.
[00:15:21.81]


[00:15:24.68]
SANDY HAYDEN: And, um, can you--

[00:15:26.40]
can you describe what
happened, um, in 1939 when--
[00:15:30.72]
when--

[00:15:31.37]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, well,
when the war broke out,
[00:15:35.09]
when the Germans attacked
Poland, the Poles, a lot
[00:15:42.60]
of Polish, uh, soldiers were
running through our town
[00:15:47.22]
towards Russia.

[00:15:48.91]
They were escaping
from the Germans.
[00:15:52.61]
And, uh, the war broke out on
the 1st of September, 1939.
[00:16:01.09]
And I think it was the 17th of
September the Russians came in
[00:16:08.46]
from-- from Minsk,
from the other side
[00:16:11.12]
and occupied our town.

[00:16:14.09]
And we came under the Russian
government and the Russian, uh,
[00:16:21.78]
occupation.

[00:16:22.73]
SANDY HAYDEN: And
did things start
[00:16:24.15]
to change very
much at that time?
[00:16:25.75]
RUBIN PINSKI: Changed--
it changed very--
[00:16:27.46]
very rapidly, yes.

[00:16:29.08]
SANDY HAYDEN: How old
were you, um, when the--
[00:16:32.61]
RUBIN PINSKI: In 1939?

[00:16:33.53]
SANDY HAYDEN: 1939.

[00:16:34.32]
You mind me asking you?

[00:16:35.64]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I
was only 15 years old.
[00:16:37.46]
SANDY HAYDEN: 15 years old.

[00:16:38.94]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:16:39.39]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:16:40.27]
So you were a young-- you
were a young boy then?
[00:16:43.10]
RUBIN PINSKI: Very young boy.

[00:16:44.49]
SANDY HAYDEN: Do
you remember-- do
[00:16:45.60]
you remember some
of the feelings
[00:16:46.98]
that you had when-- when--
when the Russians occupied
[00:16:49.24]
your town?

[00:16:49.74]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, when the
Russians came, I mean, we--
[00:16:52.23]
we accepted them with open arms.

[00:16:54.81]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:16:55.68]
You mean rather than
have the Germans--
[00:16:57.23]
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

[00:16:58.36]
We knew what the
Germans did to the Jews.
[00:17:00.41]
And they-- they were
actually, uh, liberators.
[00:17:04.59]
And they behaved very
nice except some of the--
[00:17:09.57]
from the rich Jews
took away the--
[00:17:13.97]
their stores.

[00:17:14.91]
Anybody who had a fabric
store, other kinds of stores,
[00:17:19.34]
they confiscated it.

[00:17:22.05]
But they let the
people work for them,
[00:17:25.66]
and they found
jobs for everybody.
[00:17:28.09]
And life went on fine.

[00:17:32.22]
SANDY HAYDEN: But
you were hearing--
[00:17:33.72]
you were hearing reports of
what was going on in Germany.
[00:17:37.59]
Can you tell me what some of
the things that you heard in--
[00:17:40.39]
RUBIN PINSKI: They used to
hear only from the paper
[00:17:45.06]
what the Germans behaved--

[00:17:47.57]
did bad to the Germans
Jews, also to the, uh--
[00:17:52.12]
when we heard the trouble
before the Russians came in.
[00:17:58.68]
We knew what's going more
or less on in the paper.
[00:18:02.27]
But the Russians concealed
from us everything.
[00:18:04.98]
They didn't know what's going
on in the other half of Poland.
[00:18:09.18]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really,
once they occupied--
[00:18:10.93]
RUBIN PINSKI: Once
they occupied,
[00:18:12.30]
we didn't know anything, just--

[00:18:14.97]
they told us what they
wanted to tell us.
[00:18:17.55]
SANDY HAYDEN: So did--
did you feel at any time
[00:18:20.57]
that you and your family
would like to escape or to go
[00:18:23.16]
to another part of Europe?

[00:18:24.32]
Or did you feel
that you would just
[00:18:26.45]
stay their for the meantime?

[00:18:28.24]
RUBIN PINSKI: Even if you felt--

[00:18:29.57]
but we couldn't do anything--

[00:18:31.01]
SANDY HAYDEN: You
didn't have a chance.
[00:18:32.64]
RUBIN PINSKI: --because
the Russian policy was you,
[00:18:36.30]
uh, if you are not with
us, you are against us.
[00:18:39.18]
In other words, if you
want to go away, you are--
[00:18:42.99]
you are our enemy.

[00:18:44.61]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:18:45.36]
So that was dangerous
for you too.
[00:18:47.22]
RUBIN PINSKI: So
we couldn't even
[00:18:48.59]
think of escaping or
going anywhere then.
[00:18:53.15]
We didn't have the
money to go too.
[00:18:56.39]
There was no-- nowhere to go.

[00:18:58.83]
SANDY HAYDEN: But
when the Russians
[00:19:00.29]
came to occupy
<<INAUDIBLE>>,, you must
[00:19:03.27]
have been at you-- at yeshiva
in the neighboring town?
[00:19:06.56]
Or had you come back in town.

[00:19:07.77]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I came back
to our town, because the, uh,
[00:19:11.39]
Russians, they didn't exactly--

[00:19:15.24]
they didn't say you
can do it, but so--
[00:19:19.49]
all the religious issues
disappeared somehow.
[00:19:24.31]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:19:25.72]
RUBIN PINSKI: The,
uh, officially,
[00:19:28.35]
they didn't say you
cannot go to synagogue,
[00:19:31.97]
because the Jews went
to synagogue while, uh--
[00:19:35.21]
while they were in occupation.

[00:19:38.12]
But somehow, the Jews
alone were afraid to do it.
[00:19:42.88]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:19:43.84]
So-- so yeshivas closed down?

[00:19:46.48]
RUBIN PINSKI: There was no--
no more yeshivas at all.
[00:19:48.84]
And then we-- we um, had
to go to Russian schools
[00:19:53.27]
to learn Russian.

[00:19:54.18]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:19:54.93]
So that's what you did
when you went back home.
[00:19:56.33]
RUBIN PINSKI: That's
what I did, yes.
[00:19:57.28]
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were at-- at a school
[00:19:59.03]
with Russians and Poles.

[00:20:00.84]
And it was now a
mix-- a mixed school.
[00:20:02.85]
RUBIN PINSKI: Mixed, but
we-- we taught the subjects
[00:20:05.02]
that are only Russian.

[00:20:06.55]
We started a new
language altogether.
[00:20:08.46]
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how was-- how was it
[00:20:10.04]
going to a school
like that, because it
[00:20:12.08]
seems to be very different
from what you were used to?
[00:20:14.51]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, uh, but we--

[00:20:17.59]
we could learn,
because the language
[00:20:19.64]
itself was, uh, was a lot easier
to catch, because the white--
[00:20:26.63]
white Russian is
similar to Russian.
[00:20:28.61]
Polish is also a bit
similar in a way.
[00:20:33.52]
And the-- the writing
and reading was harder,
[00:20:38.32]
but the speaking, we
caught on very fast.
[00:20:41.27]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:20:42.02]
And how was it to be
in the class with, um,
[00:20:44.86]
with other children, with the
Russian and Polish children?
[00:20:47.63]
Did you get on with them,
or was there anti-Semitism?
[00:20:49.84]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:20:50.87]
No, no, there was
no anti-Semitism,
[00:20:52.88]
because, uh, they--
they knew that uh,
[00:20:58.11]
the Russians in the
Russian government,
[00:21:03.30]
there was no
anti-Semitism at all.
[00:21:04.90]
Everybody is the same.

[00:21:07.06]
And actually, they used to, uh,
punish for anti-Semitic, uh,
[00:21:14.00]
the writing--

[00:21:15.19]
saying.

[00:21:16.91]
They, uh, used to--

[00:21:18.64]
people are afraid
to be anti-Semitic.
[00:21:20.30]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

[00:21:21.17]
And the Poles also then
were afraid in school
[00:21:23.36]
to be anti-Semitic.

[00:21:24.15]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
actually, the Poles,
[00:21:26.66]
the few Poles that
were in our town
[00:21:28.52]
disappeared, the ones that were
in the administration before.
[00:21:34.04]
And the-- the Polish
farmers behaved like, uh,
[00:21:40.62]
like they have to behave
under the Russian occupation.
[00:21:44.39]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:21:45.47]
So how many years was--
were you under occupation
[00:21:48.48]
by the Russian forces?

[00:21:50.36]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, from
1939, from September 1939
[00:21:54.80]
till the outbreak of the
war at the 22nd of June,
[00:21:59.82]
1941 when Hitler
attacked Russia.
[00:22:03.56]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:22:04.31]
So that was two years.

[00:22:06.73]
RUBIN PINSKI: Nearly two years.

[00:22:08.02]
SANDY HAYDEN: Right,
nearly two years, yeah.
[00:22:09.05]
RUBIN PINSKI: Two years, yes.

[00:22:09.76]
SANDY HAYDEN: And in a way, it
sounds like your life didn't
[00:22:12.22]
change too much in those tears.

[00:22:13.86]
The everyday living
didn't change too much.
[00:22:17.49]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, it
did change in, uh, in uh,
[00:22:20.93]
the way that, from one
government to the other,
[00:22:24.93]
which, uh, the Russians had
started to, uh, put in us--
[00:22:31.92]
teach-- teach us-- teach us
their ways that you cannot be
[00:22:35.45]
in the, uh, dealings or any,
uh, you cannot own a store.
[00:22:41.33]
You can-- you can't,
uh, be for your own.
[00:22:44.29]
Everything has to be
for the government.
[00:22:45.96]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:22:46.60]
RUBIN PINSKI: Now what you have
to work for the government.
[00:22:48.91]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:22:49.66]
So it was more
Marxist or socialist.
[00:22:52.37]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:22:53.32]
They tried to teach us.

[00:22:55.13]
But it wasn't so easy to
absorb in the beginning.
[00:22:58.89]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, so that
was a bit difficult for--
[00:23:01.34]
for all of you.

[00:23:02.64]
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right,
but it was at least safe.
[00:23:05.16]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:23:05.91]
And was your father
able to continue
[00:23:07.61]
doing what he had been doing?

[00:23:08.87]
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

[00:23:09.58]
SANDY HAYDEN: What-- what--

[00:23:10.71]
what did he-- what
happened to his work then?
[00:23:13.94]
RUBIN PINSKI: He, uh, he
used to buy, well, not
[00:23:17.48]
exactly the same way as to--

[00:23:20.45]
before used to buy direct
from the farmers and--
[00:23:23.83]
and sell it.

[00:23:24.78]
And here he had to work
for the government.
[00:23:28.00]
He used to buy also
from the farmers,
[00:23:31.25]
but, uh, like in a
cooperative sort of.
[00:23:34.57]
He used to write down
everything he buys
[00:23:38.52]
and, uh, pay out the farmers.

[00:23:42.15]
He worked for the
government, in other words.
[00:23:44.12]
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how-- how was that?
[00:23:45.66]
Was that a big change for him?

[00:23:47.33]
RUBIN PINSKI: He got
used to it first.
[00:23:48.91]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:23:50.41]
But it was-- it was all right.

[00:23:51.84]
RUBIN PINSKI: Before
that change, yeah.
[00:23:53.46]
But we got used to it.

[00:23:54.38]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:23:55.26]
Did that mean that,
materially, that you
[00:23:57.08]
had less in your family
than you were used to?
[00:24:00.33]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
uh, a little bit less,
[00:24:03.17]
but it wasn't too bad.

[00:24:04.88]
It was enough to get by.

[00:24:07.06]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:24:07.83]
So food, and
clothing, and shoes,
[00:24:10.58]
and all that sort of thing
during the Russian occupation
[00:24:13.05]
wasn't-- was that-- was
not too much of a problem.
[00:24:15.19]
You never--

[00:24:16.93]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, it was
a problem, because it never
[00:24:20.67]
brought in anything.

[00:24:22.17]
They took away.

[00:24:22.99]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:24:23.94]
RUBIN PINSKI: Anything
that was produced,
[00:24:26.01]
they took away from our
town and sent into Russia.
[00:24:29.10]
But, uh, we never
brought anything.
[00:24:32.77]
If they did bring
something, you had
[00:24:35.66]
to stand in, uh, a queue
for-- for hours to get it.
[00:24:41.12]
But we didn't complain.

[00:24:42.86]
It was-- they let us live.

[00:24:45.35]
That was-- that was
the main good thing
[00:24:48.44]
about the Russian occupation.

[00:24:49.87]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:24:50.62]
So you were just hoping that
that would continue right
[00:24:54.11]
until--

[00:24:54.73]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:24:55.56]
SANDY HAYDEN: But then in 1941--

[00:24:58.19]
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941, when Hitler
attacked, uh, Russia, our city
[00:25:05.06]
was taken by the
Germans officially
[00:25:08.97]
until the 8th of June, 1941.

[00:25:12.15]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:25:12.90]
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was eight days later.
[00:25:16.08]
And in the eight
days, the, uh, there
[00:25:20.36]
were some battles close to our
town with the, uh, the, uh,
[00:25:28.27]
Russians who were running
away with the Germans who
[00:25:31.59]
were coming as parachutists.

[00:25:38.71]
The-- actually
they didn't take--
[00:25:40.57]
the Germans didn't occupy
our town as a full army.
[00:25:45.13]
But, uh, the, uh, they
parachuted behind the town
[00:25:51.47]
and attacked all the, uh,
running away trucks and, uh,
[00:25:56.83]
and tanks from the Russian.

[00:25:58.63]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:25:59.38]
So there was--

[00:26:00.39]
RUBIN PINSKI: Eight days.

[00:26:01.43]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, so there
was fighting around your town
[00:26:03.93]
for-- for eight days.

[00:26:04.89]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah, so
fighting about eight days.
[00:26:06.81]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:26:07.68]
And what was it like
during those eight days.
[00:26:09.89]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
it was very bad.
[00:26:11.66]
The, uh, the Jews,
uh, not only do
[00:26:14.74]
the whole population couldn't
get out of the houses, hiding
[00:26:17.20]
in the houses.

[00:26:18.87]
And they did get out
the, uh, the planes
[00:26:24.40]
shooting over the head,
the German planes.
[00:26:28.25]
In other words, uh,
most people were hiding.
[00:26:31.52]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:26:32.27]
And you must-- do you rem--

[00:26:34.09]
I mean, you must have been
very frightened about it.
[00:26:36.57]
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
frightened, yes.
[00:26:37.36]
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you
remember the feeling?
[00:26:39.11]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
yes, I remember.
[00:26:40.66]
I used to hide even
in the basement.
[00:26:43.15]
SANDY HAYDEN: With
your whole family?
[00:26:44.69]
RUBIN PINSKI: The whole family
for days till-- till the, uh,
[00:26:50.29]
shooting got a little
bit, uh, eased.
[00:26:54.30]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:26:55.18]
And during those
eight days, do you--
[00:26:57.46]
I mean, were you
worried about what
[00:26:58.92]
was going to happen now
that the Russians had left?
[00:27:01.47]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
the uh, we knew
[00:27:03.89]
that it's not so good that
the Germans occupied the, uh,
[00:27:11.36]
living will be, uh,
bad <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:27:15.55]
We knew what to expect.

[00:27:16.75]
SANDY HAYDEN: You did know?

[00:27:17.87]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:27:18.45]
SANDY HAYDEN: Was this--

[00:27:19.45]
how hard-- how-- how did
you know this information,
[00:27:22.28]
because you--

[00:27:23.24]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we knew what they do--
[00:27:25.19]
they did in Germany
or in Poland.
[00:27:27.95]
So we knew what to expect.

[00:27:31.09]
And so it happened.

[00:27:32.41]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:27:33.16]
Can you-- can you
tell us what happened
[00:27:34.68]
from the time the
Germans occupied?
[00:27:35.12]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:27:36.46]
The German soldiers,
they came in the town.
[00:27:40.09]
They-- they were very careful
walking by houses singularly.
[00:27:46.14]
They, uh, first
came in without--
[00:27:50.36]
without, uh, cars, or tanks,
or just occupied the city.
[00:27:56.91]
And, uh, immediately,
they started,
[00:28:00.60]
um, they started to
ask the, uh, some
[00:28:07.53]
of the, uh, Polish or white--

[00:28:11.01]
or the-- or the
non-Jewish population
[00:28:14.52]
where are-- where the Jews are.

[00:28:17.26]
And they asked for food from
the Jews and asked for bicycles.
[00:28:22.25]
SANDY HAYDEN: And you
gave it all to them?
[00:28:24.00]
RUBIN PINSKI: Everything.

[00:28:24.31]
SANDY HAYDEN: They had to, yeah.

[00:28:25.20]
RUBIN PINSKI: They
had no choice.
[00:28:26.58]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:28:27.39]
RUBIN PINSKI: And they had--

[00:28:29.92]
right away, the Germans
had some of the, uh,
[00:28:34.69]
of the town's inhabitants.

[00:28:37.20]
Some of them where they
with them, helping them,
[00:28:42.89]
uh, showing them the
Jewish, uh, houses.
[00:28:47.13]
And they went and robbed,
and beat, and uh, and--
[00:28:53.46]
the three days
after the, uh, they
[00:28:59.40]
had already with them
some, um, placards
[00:29:04.14]
hanging out in, uh, three
languages-- in German,
[00:29:08.84]
in Russian, and,
uh, and uh, Polish.
[00:29:13.98]
All de-- decrees against Jews.

[00:29:16.88]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

[00:29:17.75]
Yeah.

[00:29:18.70]
RUBIN PINSKI: That the Jews,
uh, cannot walk on the sidewalk.
[00:29:23.26]
They cannot, uh,
possess, uh, fur coats.
[00:29:28.57]
He cannot-- they
cannot have any gold.
[00:29:33.62]
They have to give it
away to the Germans--
[00:29:36.35]
and a long list of
decrees against Jews.
[00:29:41.34]
So we knew right away
the trouble started.
[00:29:44.69]


[00:29:47.40]
And, uh, slowly, the Jews
started to come out of the--
[00:29:54.17]
of the hiding.

[00:29:55.45]
And-- and, uh, the, uh, Germans
gave every day new orders
[00:30:06.72]
to, uh, collect food and
collect clothes for them.
[00:30:11.80]
And then in the, uh, third
week was in July the 5th.
[00:30:18.08]
SANDY HAYDEN: At that
time, had they, um,
[00:30:19.92]
had there been any brutality?

[00:30:22.13]
Had there been-- had
they killed any Jews
[00:30:24.32]
during those three weeks?

[00:30:25.51]
Or had they just beaten them up?

[00:30:27.70]
RUBIN PINSKI: They killed--

[00:30:29.63]
they made like, um,
6 o'clock was curfew.
[00:30:34.50]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:30:35.41]
RUBIN PINSKI: And nobody
could go-- get out
[00:30:37.65]
of the house at 6
o'clock in the evening.
[00:30:41.94]
It wasn't evening yet.

[00:30:43.96]
So in several cases, some
Jews walked to one house
[00:30:50.55]
to the other.

[00:30:51.16]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

[00:30:52.03]
RUBIN PINSKI: After six of
them got shot right way.
[00:30:54.32]
In other words,
non-Jews weren't shot.
[00:30:57.06]
But Jews are shot
for-- for that.
[00:30:59.95]
That was the-- several
Jews were shot that way.
[00:31:05.01]
But then on the 15th of
July, the, uh, the uh,
[00:31:11.64]
order to make Judenrat.

[00:31:13.92]
In other words, they picked
10 of the best Jews from town
[00:31:18.92]
and--

[00:31:20.01]
and ordered them
to have a Judenrat
[00:31:22.31]
and have a Jewish police.

[00:31:26.40]
And, uh, then the, uh,
the next day, the--
[00:31:32.40]
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you know--
you knew some of the people who
[00:31:34.86]
were elected to the Judenrat?

[00:31:37.23]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:31:38.32]
Actually, the best, uh, the
best, uh, people from the city.
[00:31:44.61]
One was a lawyer called Alter
Dvoretsky was a young man.
[00:31:49.39]
He was very capable.

[00:31:50.85]
He was at the head
of the Judenrat
[00:31:53.97]
and, uh, several of
religious Jews <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:31:59.99]
SANDY HAYDEN: So they--
they were all good people.
[00:32:02.07]
RUBIN PINSKI: All-- a
better class of people.
[00:32:06.17]
As a matter of fact,
the rabbi for our town
[00:32:08.34]
was also included in that.

[00:32:11.22]
And the men on the
15h of July, it
[00:32:16.39]
was only two weeks
after they occup--
[00:32:19.73]
they came in, they,
uh, sent the police
[00:32:23.92]
to tell all the Jews to
come on the marketplace,
[00:32:29.37]
to get on the market place
from the age of 16 to 60.
[00:32:37.11]
Actually, they said
officially 16 to 60,
[00:32:41.97]
but whenever they
caught younger ones,
[00:32:44.22]
they also pushed
to the marketplace.
[00:32:47.72]
And, uh, on that--

[00:32:50.88]
on that, uh, marketplace,
the Gestapo came in.
[00:32:56.35]
They had a-- a table
and the market chairs.
[00:32:59.69]
And they had a
big list of people
[00:33:03.08]
who they called and said,
anybody will be called out
[00:33:06.55]
should go forward.

[00:33:07.85]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:33:09.00]
RUBIN PINSKI: And that way,
they took away 120 people.
[00:33:13.16]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:33:13.92]
What sort of people were they?

[00:33:15.31]
All men or--

[00:33:16.10]
RUBIN PINSKI: All men and
the better-- the better
[00:33:20.01]
class of people from the
city, and the-- and the
[00:33:23.12]
uh, the richer and, uh, more
learned, and they packed them
[00:33:32.61]
in talks.

[00:33:34.42]
SANDY HAYDEN: How
do you-- how do
[00:33:35.79]
you think they got that list?

[00:33:37.00]
Who gave them the list?

[00:33:37.98]
RUBIN PINSKI: The, uh, the
list was helped by the, uh,
[00:33:42.90]
local, by local
collaborators to the Germans.
[00:33:46.96]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:33:47.88]
Who knew the people in
the-- the Jewish people.
[00:33:49.96]
RUBIN PINSKI: They
knew everybody.
[00:33:52.03]
As a matter of fact,
in <<INAUDIBLE>>,,
[00:33:55.56]
in the Hebrew school,
there was a janitor,
[00:33:59.49]
and he could speak Yiddish
just as good as any Jew.
[00:34:03.67]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:34:04.44]
RUBIN PINSKI: And he was
right away with the Germans
[00:34:07.49]
and gave out all the Jews
who were, uh, known in the--
[00:34:15.11]
in the town .

[00:34:15.71]


[00:34:18.77]
And, uh, they took--
they said they
[00:34:21.86]
are going to take this, uh, 120
people to work in Nowogrodek.
[00:34:28.50]
Nowogrodek is a bigger city than
us about 38 kilometers away.
[00:34:35.84]
But we found out later that they
were shot in the Nowogrodek.
[00:34:40.48]
SANDY HAYDEN: And when
did you find that out?
[00:34:43.54]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we found out from--
[00:34:46.28]
from peasants, which saw it.

[00:34:50.46]
SANDY HAYDEN: So that was
the first really bad atrocity
[00:34:53.73]
that--

[00:34:54.23]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:34:55.19]
That was only two weeks
after they entered our town.
[00:35:00.14]
And, uh, the kids saw all
kinds of, uh, every day they
[00:35:07.09]
demanded from us something
else, the Germans.
[00:35:12.28]
The, uh, or-- we organized
work like there was, uh,
[00:35:21.20]
a highway the Russians
started and didn't finish.
[00:35:25.38]
So they, uh, took
men who could-- well,
[00:35:31.46]
they were a little stronger
to work on that highway.
[00:35:34.56]
And I was also, uh,
working on that highway.
[00:35:38.73]
SANDY HAYDEN: Because
then you were a young man.
[00:35:40.73]
You were 16, 17.

[00:35:41.01]
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
young and strong, and--
[00:35:42.96]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

[00:35:43.31]
RUBIN PINSKI: And
I wanted to leave,
[00:35:44.81]
and they gave out
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>>..
[00:35:46.96]
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>> means
some kind of a document.
[00:35:49.70]
There was-- it went
by the column more
[00:35:55.46]
the people who were
stronger hard workers had
[00:35:59.73]
a red <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>.

[00:36:00.73]
Some had green
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>>..
[00:36:04.25]
And, uh, the people--

[00:36:06.61]
the Jews were very,
uh, wanted very
[00:36:10.05]
much to get <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>.

[00:36:12.07]
So--

[00:36:12.57]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:36:13.36]
So you had-- you had a red one?

[00:36:15.33]
RUBIN PINSKI: I have a good
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>>,, yes.
[00:36:16.56]
SANDY HAYDEN: You
had a good one.
[00:36:17.29]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:36:18.35]
SANDY HAYDEN: How were you
chosen to-- to go and work?
[00:36:21.44]
RUBIN PINSKI: I,
uh, actually, they
[00:36:24.81]
were asking for volunteers,
and, uh, I wanted for this job,
[00:36:32.67]
so I worked on the--

[00:36:34.07]
on the, uh, building
that highway.
[00:36:36.00]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:36:36.75]
And your brothers?

[00:36:38.34]
RUBIN PINSKI: My
brother wasn't with me.
[00:36:40.17]
He was, uh-- he
was already taken--
[00:36:43.86]
before the at-- the
Germans attacked,
[00:36:48.11]
he was taken to
the Russian Army.
[00:36:50.01]
SANDY HAYDEN: How--
who-- who took him?
[00:36:51.63]
Was he conscripted
to the Russian Army?
[00:36:54.14]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, no.

[00:36:55.01]
He was already of age.

[00:36:56.40]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh, oh, I see.

[00:36:57.03]
RUBIN PINSKI: He
was born in 19--
[00:36:58.40]
SANDY HAYDEN: So he was in--

[00:36:59.44]
RUBIN PINSKI: 20.

[00:37:00.15]
He was 18 years old,
and he was taken legally
[00:37:04.43]
to the Russian Army.

[00:37:05.38]
SANDY HAYDEN: To
the Russian Army.
[00:37:05.86]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:06.52]
So had you-- did you keep--

[00:37:09.11]
manage to keep correspondence
with him during that time?
[00:37:11.52]
RUBIN PINSKI: It wasn't very--

[00:37:13.48]
it was right before the war.

[00:37:15.07]
All we heard-- we had only one
letter from him that is going
[00:37:19.70]
into--

[00:37:20.21]
deep into Russia.

[00:37:22.64]
And then we were
apart for six years.
[00:37:26.07]
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

[00:37:26.94]
So you didn't know what
had happened to you.
[00:37:28.77]
RUBIN PINSKI: We
found him in 1946.
[00:37:30.86]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:37:32.90]
So that was-- that must have
been very hard for your mother
[00:37:35.36]
and father.

[00:37:36.02]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

[00:37:36.95]
SANDY HAYDEN: It
would be really--
[00:37:37.42]
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

[00:37:38.82]
SANDY HAYDEN: And your sister?

[00:37:39.68]
And--

[00:37:40.18]
RUBIN PINSKI: The sister was
the whole time with me together.
[00:37:43.95]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:37:45.23]
And then your younger brother.

[00:37:46.57]
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
my younger sister.
[00:37:47.85]
SANDY HAYDEN: Your
younger sister, sorry.
[00:37:49.56]
RUBIN PINSKI: I didn't
tell <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:37:51.59]
She perished in, uh, in 1942
in August together the parents.
[00:37:59.17]
SANDY HAYDEN: So your father--

[00:38:00.86]
when the Germans
came, your father
[00:38:02.32]
stopped, um, working, and--

[00:38:06.26]
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

[00:38:07.09]
SANDY HAYDEN: You were the
only one that was really,
[00:38:09.49]
um, working on the highway.

[00:38:12.45]
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
the only one, yes.
[00:38:14.03]
SANDY HAYDEN: So-- what-- what--

[00:38:15.54]
what were you getting
paid in any way?
[00:38:17.27]
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

[00:38:17.63]
No.

[00:38:17.99]
SANDY HAYDEN: Did they feed you?

[00:38:18.38]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they
didn't pay us anything.
[00:38:20.30]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:38:21.30]
RUBIN PINSKI: Uh, the--

[00:38:24.02]
the, uh, in 1941 on
November, the Germans
[00:38:33.83]
told us to leave our houses
and go into a ghetto.
[00:38:38.36]
They made a ghetto.

[00:38:40.73]
The Jews themselves had to
make a fence, a wired fence,
[00:38:44.11]
around it.

[00:38:46.94]
And at that time, uh, we
could only take with us
[00:38:51.59]
whatever we could--

[00:38:52.94]
SANDY HAYDEN: Carry.

[00:38:53.77]
RUBIN PINSKI: Carry.

[00:38:54.60]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:38:55.55]
RUBIN PINSKI: And
it happened that we
[00:38:58.62]
had a big-- a very
big garden and used
[00:39:02.81]
to have enough
potatoes to put it
[00:39:07.15]
in a big hole covered
with earth and hide it
[00:39:12.47]
for the next spring.

[00:39:14.12]
That was done actually
normal times too.
[00:39:17.30]
SANDY HAYDEN: Right.

[00:39:18.62]
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

[00:39:20.60]
all the potato that we got from,
uh, before the winter came,
[00:39:28.38]
we bur--

[00:39:30.16]
we buried it in the garden.

[00:39:33.75]
And, um, so in Spring
of 1942 in the ghetto,
[00:39:42.11]
I had that chance I--

[00:39:44.20]
to open that hole and--

[00:39:45.78]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:39:46.53]
RUBIN PINSKI: --put in the
potatoes in the ghetto so we
[00:39:49.43]
could have--

[00:39:50.15]
SANDY HAYDEN: Some food?

[00:39:51.58]
RUBIN PINSKI: Some
food for a while.
[00:39:54.05]
The whole-- the whole, uh, all
the inhabitants of that house,
[00:39:59.16]
we shared.

[00:40:00.84]
We used to bring in
like, uh, hiding it in--
[00:40:08.20]
in a way that the Germans
shouldn't see that they
[00:40:11.28]
carried potatoes in this--

[00:40:12.40]
SANDY HAYDEN: How did
you-- how did you do that?
[00:40:14.40]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, we
into the night, at night,
[00:40:17.41]
and brought it in.

[00:40:19.12]
The houses that the
Germans confiscated was--
[00:40:22.82]
in the front of the house
was some sort of, uh--
[00:40:27.54]
uh, a list that,
uh, but this house
[00:40:33.13]
is confiscated by the Germans.

[00:40:34.64]
In the front, they couldn't
get in, but from the back--
[00:40:36.96]
SANDY HAYDEN: You could?

[00:40:37.96]
RUBIN PINSKI:
--you could get in.
[00:40:39.69]
But it didn't do anything.

[00:40:40.97]
A lot of Jewish houses
were occupied by--
[00:40:44.02]
by, uh, local, uh, non-Jews.

[00:40:48.53]
But some of them are still--

[00:40:49.94]
our house was still
empty standing there.
[00:40:51.72]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:40:52.47]
So you could sneak in at night.

[00:40:53.92]
RUBIN PINSKI: I used
to sneak in every night
[00:40:56.33]
and bring a little
bit of potatoes
[00:40:58.45]
that I could carry myself.

[00:41:00.08]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:41:00.98]
RUBIN PINSKI: And that's--

[00:41:02.08]
that's how we could
live for a while.
[00:41:04.81]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm And what
were the living conditions
[00:41:07.07]
like in the ghetto?

[00:41:07.99]
RUBIN PINSKI: Very bad.

[00:41:09.09]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:41:09.41]
Can you-- can you
describe it a little bit?
[00:41:11.20]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they
packed in in the house,
[00:41:15.34]
in a little house, about 800
square feet or 900 square feet.
[00:41:20.56]
They packed in about 60 people,
one on top of the other.
[00:41:26.07]
SANDY HAYDEN: And that's how
you and your family lived--
[00:41:28.40]
lived with another--

[00:41:28.94]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, yes.

[00:41:30.08]
SANDY HAYDEN: --50 people or so.

[00:41:31.74]
RUBIN PINSKI: In the
basement and on top on the--
[00:41:35.10]
under the roof, people,
one on top of the other,
[00:41:40.36]
and the conditions in the
ghetto was very bad, dirty,
[00:41:44.49]
and no food.

[00:41:46.25]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:41:47.00]
And-- and lice also.

[00:41:49.18]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:41:51.42]
SANDY HAYDEN: And what--
what did the people,
[00:41:53.30]
the leaders of the
ghetto, of the Judenrat,
[00:41:55.73]
were they fair in the way they--

[00:41:57.65]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they were
very fair, but they were also--
[00:42:00.50]
they had the same,
uh, goals we did.
[00:42:05.47]
They were also afraid
of-- the Germans used them
[00:42:08.94]
just to get their way.

[00:42:11.37]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:42:12.46]
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, this
out-- this Alter Dvoretsky
[00:42:17.31]
is from the Judenrat.

[00:42:20.48]
He organized a partisan
group in the ghetto.
[00:42:25.89]
And anybody who
could be of help--
[00:42:29.20]
used everybody that
could be of help.
[00:42:31.06]
Only the young
people he mobilized.
[00:42:35.21]
And myself was working in the
highway, building the highway.
[00:42:40.96]
I had a chance to bring into
the ghetto parts, uh, weapons.
[00:42:46.06]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:42:47.72]
RUBIN PINSKI: So we used to
tie it in bundles of wood.
[00:42:53.40]
SANDY HAYDEN: So
they wouldn't see.
[00:42:54.86]
RUBIN PINSKI: To carry it in.

[00:42:58.24]
And, uh, I used to take
chances to bring in parts
[00:43:01.94]
of rifles and ammunition.

[00:43:06.48]
And from time to time,
the Germans used to check
[00:43:11.14]
everybody-- every bundle of--

[00:43:12.38]
SANDY HAYDEN: Wood?

[00:43:13.17]
RUBIN PINSKI: Of wood,
or on the person.
[00:43:16.27]
Anybody that was found with
something was shot right away.
[00:43:19.36]
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were lucky you never--
[00:43:21.15]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I was lucky.

[00:43:21.87]
SANDY HAYDEN: <<INAUDIBLE>>.

[00:43:22.61]
It must have been
frightening each time.
[00:43:24.28]
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, I mean--

[00:43:25.68]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, it's a risk.

[00:43:26.44]
RUBIN PINSKI: I risked
with my life all the time.
[00:43:28.69]
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

[00:43:29.89]
So you joined the partisan
group in the ghetto.
[00:43:31.85]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

[00:43:33.25]
<<INAUDIBLE>>

[00:43:33.87]
SANDY HAYDEN: 194--

[00:43:34.66]
1941?

[00:43:35.59]
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941.

[00:43:36.71]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[00:43:37.59]
RUBIN PINSKI: We organized the--

[00:43:40.42]
in the basement, we used
to put together the rifles.
[00:43:44.98]
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

[00:43:46.10]
did you use them?

[00:43:47.30]
What-- what-- what--

[00:43:48.23]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I didn't
have a chance to use,
[00:43:50.94]
and practically, nobody
had a chance, only--
[00:43:54.75]
only a few young
boys, uh, were, uh,
[00:44:00.17]
fighting against
them in the second--
[00:44:03.45]
not in the second time when
the Germans killed the Jews.
[00:44:07.91]
The Germans killed,
uh, about half
[00:44:12.35]
of the Jewish population
in the ghettos
[00:44:13.97]
they killed in 1941
till the end of April.
[00:44:18.60]
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, I-- can you--
[00:44:20.00]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

[00:44:20.75]
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you tell
me a little bit about--
[00:44:21.69]
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was a very bad day.
[00:44:23.27]
Then my parents were--

[00:44:26.06]
got killed killed and my sister.

[00:44:29.77]
Uh, it was the 30th of
April, 1941, and the Germans,
[00:44:36.38]
with the help <<INAUDIBLE>>
of the Ukrainian police,
[00:44:41.79]
so there were a few white
Russian police also surrounded
[00:44:49.10]
the ghetto.

[00:44:50.56]
And, uh, very early in the
morning, about 5 o'clock
[00:44:54.50]
in the morning, they started
to knock on the windows
[00:44:56.67]
and scream <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>.

[00:45:01.31]
And, uh, they told
us to gather in
[00:45:04.66]
that, uh, it was an old cem--

[00:45:08.46]
Jewish cemetery
near the, uh, the
[00:45:11.51]
synagogues and told
us to gather there,
[00:45:15.62]
all the Jews should together.

[00:45:17.57]
And I came there.

[00:45:20.90]
We, uh-- they told us to
stand in families, each family
[00:45:27.23]
together, all the families.

[00:45:29.54]
So I had that red
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>>,,
[00:45:32.72]
which was considered
to be a good sign.
[00:45:36.81]
And I had a friend who also
had a good <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>,,
[00:45:41.75]
so I told him to take
my sister, saying
[00:45:46.01]
that this wife and I wanted
to rescue my family, my father
[00:45:49.92]
and mother.

[00:45:53.06]
I remember they started to
select the, uh, I showed him
[00:46:00.15]
the <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>.

[00:46:01.17]
So he said, <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>,,
to the right, which was good.
[00:46:07.09]
And right after, a couple
steps from this Gestapo man,
[00:46:14.12]
stood other Gestapo
people, looked
[00:46:18.47]
at the <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>,,
and they let me go through
[00:46:22.46]
and apparently chased
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>>,,
[00:46:26.23]
in other words--

[00:46:27.83]
SANDY HAYDEN: To--
to the bad line.
[00:46:29.45]
RUBIN PINSKI: To--
to get killed.
[00:46:31.71]
They said to resettle for
labor or something else,
[00:46:37.49]
but they took them
behind the town.
[00:46:39.76]
SANDY HAYDEN: And there was
nothing that you could do.
[00:46:42.01]
RUBIN PINSKI:
Nothing I could do.
[00:46:43.63]
And my sister went
with that, uh,
[00:46:47.26]
my friend who had a good
<<SPEAKING GERMAN>> too,
[00:46:50.92]
and she was, uh, rescued.

[00:46:54.90]
SANDY HAYDEN: Is that--

[00:46:55.86]
that day must be a very hard
day for you to remember.
[00:46:58.07]
RUBIN PINSKI: A
very bad day, yeah.
[00:47:00.45]
They killed half of the
Jewish population in one day,
[00:47:05.53]
and then they
shortened the ghetto.
[00:47:08.99]
They cut it in half.

[00:47:12.75]
In other words, the, uh, all
the edges around the ghetto,
[00:47:18.78]
and they told the Jews--

[00:47:21.52]
for the Jews to put an
electric fence closer inside.
[00:47:28.36]
And I continued to
work on that highway.
[00:47:31.76]
SANDY HAYDEN:
And-- and the Jews,
[00:47:33.77]
your family and the other
Jews, were they taken?
[00:47:37.18]
What happened to them?

[00:47:38.34]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
they were taken.
[00:47:39.80]
They were led
through the streets.
[00:47:41.22]
They were taken behind the
town, and forced to undress,
[00:47:48.91]
and the, uh, the graves
were already dug.
[00:47:54.15]
It was already ready,
and they shot 50 people
[00:47:58.57]
at a time right--

[00:48:01.06]
right on top of the cliff.

[00:48:05.10]
They were all killed.

[00:48:06.60]
SANDY HAYDEN: What went
through your mind then?
[00:48:08.56]
Did you feel like you wanted
to avenge their deaths?
[00:48:10.91]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that's the only thing
[00:48:12.64]
was in my mind to avenge.

[00:48:15.82]
Well, I never believed
I'll stay alive.
[00:48:18.80]
But at least I should be
able to avenge for the--
[00:48:22.95]
for what they did.

[00:48:25.11]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:48:26.31]
Something that-- has that
stayed-- the feeling of it
[00:48:28.48]
stayed with you?

[00:48:29.15]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I still--

[00:48:30.55]
the feeling never changed.

[00:48:34.55]
Well, I can't feel exactly the
same as I felt then, but I, uh,
[00:48:41.42]
had that feeling all the time.

[00:48:44.22]
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and so
what happened after that day?
[00:48:48.41]
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the, uh,
the ghetto was shortened.
[00:48:52.59]
The Judenrat actually
was also killed.
[00:48:57.13]
They told to the Judenrat.

[00:49:00.49]


[00:49:03.35]
And, uh, they kept us
alive till August--
[00:49:10.65]
August 6th, 1942,
and, uh, August 6th ,
[00:49:17.70]
1942 happened the same thing.

[00:49:21.69]
The-- the Germans and
the Ukrainian police
[00:49:27.23]
surrounded-- surrounded
the, uh, the ghetto
[00:49:31.82]
and chased everybody
out in the marketplace.
[00:49:35.18]
But, uh, at that
time, I didn't--
[00:49:38.24]
I didn't run anymore to the--

[00:49:40.80]
on the marketplace
we were hiding.
[00:49:43.99]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:49:44.74]
Who-- who is we?

[00:49:45.68]
You?

[00:49:46.18]
You and your sister.

[00:49:47.01]
RUBIN PINSKI: I, and my
sister, and my cousin,
[00:49:51.03]
two cousins of mine.

[00:49:53.31]
We were hiding in a--

[00:49:56.68]
we-- we actually dug a
hiding place under the floor.
[00:50:03.19]
But being so close to the, uh,
ghetto gate of the <<INAUDIBLE>>
[00:50:10.31]
was the Germans where, the
other side of the ghetto, they
[00:50:14.71]
had their, uh, the officers.

[00:50:20.44]
We were afraid that close--

[00:50:23.35]
close-- being
close to the ghetto
[00:50:24.84]
would be a lot worse if
they start digging with
[00:50:29.31]
or searching with, uh, dogs.

[00:50:33.90]
So we were running--

[00:50:36.59]
we were running in a
place where my cousin
[00:50:39.30]
was working as a carpenter.

[00:50:43.68]
And the-- the-- it
was inside the ghetto.
[00:50:49.95]
You could get in from inside
and from outside the ghetto.
[00:50:53.27]
The, uh-- in other words,
the, uh, there was--
[00:50:58.72]
the back of the building
was inside the ghetto.
[00:51:01.01]
The front of the building
was out of the ghetto.
[00:51:04.17]
So we were running there
and running-- and hiding
[00:51:07.95]
in the basement.

[00:51:08.65]
There wasn't a
dark place to hide,
[00:51:13.14]
but a plain, little basement
and a tiny, little window.
[00:51:18.51]
And we got into the basement
and about 15 people there.
[00:51:24.24]
Some came also running
at that the place.
[00:51:27.92]
We are hiding there a whole day,
and through the little window,
[00:51:32.69]
you could see that--

[00:51:34.35]
the way the Germans chased
the Jews to the marketplace
[00:51:40.15]
and beating them.

[00:51:43.26]
And, uh, towards evening, at
night, we tried to get to--
[00:51:50.75]
we tried to get out of there,
because we knew we cannot stay
[00:51:54.43]
there overnight.

[00:51:57.57]
And, uh, somehow everybody
wants to get out first
[00:52:02.74]
and started to commotion
inside when the,
[00:52:07.96]
uh, the Germans with the
Lithuanians and the Ukrainians
[00:52:14.01]
were all helping the Germans,
uh, in the gathering the Jews.
[00:52:20.59]
They heard noise
in the building.
[00:52:23.68]
And they, uh, first opened
the door, and they caught us.
[00:52:29.39]
And, uh, my cousin
was a carpenter and I
[00:52:32.63]
started to beg the Germans as--

[00:52:36.82]
let us live.

[00:52:38.04]
I-- I could carpent--

[00:52:40.21]
I can.

[00:52:42.31]
So the German
answered, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:46.24]
Tomorrow, we will take
you to the new house.
[00:52:50.41]
In other words, we knew that
they were going to shoot us.
[00:52:53.41]
And they pushed us in
back into the basement
[00:52:57.80]
and put a heavy
table on top of it.
[00:53:01.27]
And, uh, outside they put
a post working, watching,
[00:53:09.83]
watching the uh, the outside
in the little window.
[00:53:15.80]
But to our-- to
our luck, the posts
[00:53:19.58]
sat down close to the
window and fell asleep.
[00:53:24.25]
And the, uh, the window
was too small for anybody
[00:53:27.65]
to get-- to crawl through.

[00:53:30.29]
So we-- we stretched out all
the cement around the window
[00:53:34.98]
and made a bigger hole, and
slowly, we took out the shoes,
[00:53:41.85]
and slowly we--

[00:53:42.95]
SANDY HAYDEN: Escaped, yeah.

[00:53:44.27]
RUBIN PINSKI: We, uh,
called out, and we, uh,
[00:53:48.53]
said that we'll--

[00:53:49.71]
we'll meet right in, uh, that.

[00:53:53.78]
A little river was
running close by,
[00:53:57.47]
and we said we shouldn't
walk with the streets.
[00:54:02.31]
We should, uh, go with the
river, which takes us out
[00:54:05.78]
in the outskirts of
the-- of the town.
[00:54:08.93]
And that way, we--

[00:54:10.49]
SANDY HAYDEN: So
you all escaped.
[00:54:12.31]
RUBIN PINSKI: Not all.

[00:54:14.32]
An older woman couldn't make it.

[00:54:17.76]
Two-- two people still, because
they found only two people
[00:54:21.92]
there in the--

[00:54:22.52]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.
in the morning.
[00:54:23.94]
RUBIN PINSKI: --in the
basement the next day.
[00:54:27.35]
They escaped, and we wandered
around for, um, for, um,
[00:54:35.74]
until--

[00:54:36.68]
until it got, uh, light.

[00:54:41.04]
They escaped, my sister,
and I, and my two cousins
[00:54:44.70]
were running together, and
they came not very far.
[00:54:51.34]
They ran away about 10
kilometers out of town.
[00:54:55.40]
And it was already light.

[00:54:58.36]
We couldn't walk any further,
so we were hiding a little--
[00:55:03.59]
the little forest was very--

[00:55:06.41]
it wasn't-- it was a very
dangerous place to stay.
[00:55:09.88]
But we crawled into a bush.

[00:55:12.63]
We were hiding there.

[00:55:14.86]
And the shepherds could--

[00:55:17.08]
uh, we could see the
shepherds in the morning.
[00:55:21.58]
And somehow, we are lucky
that nobody noticed us
[00:55:26.29]
the whole day.

[00:55:28.77]
So the next evening,
we were trying
[00:55:34.54]
to get food into the
forest, because the, uh,
[00:55:40.90]
the forest around our
town was only about,
[00:55:46.21]
uh, 4 to 20 kilometers away.

[00:55:50.03]
SANDY HAYDEN: Were you planning
then to join partisan groups?
[00:55:52.57]
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that was the main idea,
[00:55:54.48]
to join the partisans.

[00:55:56.61]
And, uh, the next night, we
came towards the, uh, forest
[00:56:04.72]
where the partisans were.

[00:56:07.15]
But talking to a peasant,
we knocked on the door,
[00:56:14.11]
and eh opened the door
to us, and he said--
[00:56:17.23]
he gave us bad news that
the Russian partisans are--
[00:56:23.93]
they are anti-Semitic, and they
killed some Jewish partisans,
[00:56:29.48]
which was the leader,
Alter Dvoretsky.
[00:56:33.04]
He was killed, and he suggested
we should go into, uh,
[00:56:41.95]
there was a <<SPEAKING GERMAN>>
like a working--
[00:56:45.42]
uh, it was a camp, which
was about 30 kilometers
[00:56:51.16]
from our town, and the town
was called <<INAUDIBLE>>..
[00:56:55.93]
And, uh, there the Germans
need these people, the Jews,
[00:57:01.15]
to build for them an airport.

[00:57:04.33]
And it was a chance to stay
alive as that farmer suggested.
[00:57:10.72]
And we took his advice, and
we went towards that, uh,
[00:57:14.26]
camp, which was--

[00:57:18.22]
together was about 33
kilometers to make.
[00:57:21.85]
So to the next,
towards <<INAUDIBLE>>,,
[00:57:27.49]
we went around our town
towards that, uh, camp.
[00:57:34.39]
And the next morning,
we came-- we came--
[00:57:38.38]
we finally came to that camp.

[00:57:40.21]
We joined a group
of Jewish workers,
[00:57:42.41]
and we got into that camp.

[00:57:45.56]
Our feet were swollen,
because we were always
[00:57:48.64]
walking barefoot.

[00:57:50.71]
SANDY HAYDEN: And hungry.

[00:57:51.97]
RUBIN PINSKI: And hungry.

[00:57:53.89]
But the conditions in that
camp was just terrible.
[00:57:57.31]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:57:58.78]
RUBIN PINSKI: It was summer.

[00:58:00.88]
People slept under the sky.

[00:58:03.10]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:58:04.87]
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh,
there was very little food.
[00:58:08.97]
And people had to carry stones
from one place to the other
[00:58:13.21]
to--

[00:58:14.03]
to, uh, build that airport.

[00:58:18.78]
And, uh, the, uh, we couldn't
work here, because we--
[00:58:25.83]
our feet were all--

[00:58:26.62]
SANDY HAYDEN: Was sore.

[00:58:27.58]
RUBIN PINSKI: --were
beaten and swollen.
[00:58:29.62]
So but they forced
us to go to work.
[00:58:33.08]
SANDY HAYDEN: Who-- were these
not Germans again or Russians?
[00:58:36.28]
Who?

[00:58:37.10]
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
the, uh, the people
[00:58:40.63]
who watched us were
actually Ukrainians.
[00:58:43.95]
And there were Jewish police.

[00:58:46.51]
The Germans always had this
streak to-- the-- to have
[00:58:52.66]
their--

[00:58:53.41]
their own-- their
own people to--
[00:58:56.55]
to do the bad job.

[00:58:58.99]
So the Jewish police would
chase down the Jews to work.
[00:59:04.16]
Actually, they had to.

[00:59:05.44]
They had no choice.

[00:59:06.35]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[00:59:07.10]
So you-- you--

[00:59:08.41]
you are sympathetic to their
position, the Jewish police.
[00:59:11.82]
You don't feel any--

[00:59:14.38]
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they didn't
do anything that they could help
[00:59:16.97]
it .

[00:59:17.47]
A lot of them were
actually in the partisans,
[00:59:19.52]
were running away to
the partisans together.
[00:59:21.58]
But, uh, they had no choice.

[00:59:26.06]
They were appointed
by the Germans,
[00:59:28.73]
and they to do what the
Germans told them to do.
[00:59:33.22]
And, uh, finally by--

[00:59:38.24]
by being there about
three weeks, we did--
[00:59:41.52]
I, for example, had to--

[00:59:43.31]
was chased out to go to work
on the carrying the stones.
[00:59:49.16]
And I was looking for a way
to go back to the partisans
[00:59:53.38]
till I--

[00:59:54.44]
one day, I found--

[00:59:56.33]
I noticed someone who I
knew went to the forest
[01:00:01.16]
yet before the slaughter
of the Jews in our town.
[01:00:06.26]
And when I talked to
him, and we met up,
[01:00:11.87]
they said that he
came to pick up Jews
[01:00:14.84]
from this camp to the forest.

[01:00:20.59]
And he gave me a
<<INAUDIBLE>>,, a map how to--
[01:00:24.00]
SANDY HAYDEN: To get there.

[01:00:25.12]
RUBIN PINSKI: Go around.

[01:00:26.63]
Not to go to villages or to, uh,
in other words, to be careful
[01:00:34.57]
not to fall into certain,
uh, certain peasants who
[01:00:40.42]
helped the Germans.

[01:00:43.00]
And, uh, and, uh,
one-- one evening,
[01:00:49.56]
instead of going back to the--

[01:00:52.00]
the ghetto, there
was also a ghetto
[01:00:53.92]
in that camp, sort of a
ghetto, I stayed behind a--
[01:00:59.25]
a hump of stones.

[01:01:02.77]
And, uh, we left that camp.

[01:01:07.94]
SANDY HAYDEN: You, and
your sister, and cousins.
[01:01:09.94]
RUBIN PINSKI: My sister
and my two cousins.
[01:01:11.86]
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

[01:01:12.91]
RUBIN PINSKI: And
another two, six of us,
[01:01:17.27]
and we made it during
the night to the forest.
[01:01:21.39]
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

[01:01:22.54]
Well, I think we finished
the first half of the tape.
[01:01:25.65]
So--

[01:01:26.15]
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

[01:01:26.94]
SANDY HAYDEN: They are going
to rewind it and then--
[01:01:27.91]
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

[01:01:28.62]
SANDY HAYDEN: --we
can start from the--
[01:01:30.52]
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, in
the <<INAUDIBLE>> forest.
[01:01:32.35]
SANDY HAYDEN: In a
few minutes, yeah.
[01:01:34.50]


[01:01:39.27]
