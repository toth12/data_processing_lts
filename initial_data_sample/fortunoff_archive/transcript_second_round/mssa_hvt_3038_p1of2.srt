00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,460

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,940
SANDY HAYDEN: OK, Holocaust
documentation project,

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,010
June 15, 1983.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,672
I'm Sandy Hayden interviewing
Mr. Rubin Pinski.

5
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:32,910
Um, Mr. Pinski, um, you were
born in a little town in P--

6
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,410
Poland.

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,290
Can you tell us what the
name of the town was?

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,225
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, the
name of town is Zdzieciol.

9
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:37,830
SANDY HAYDEN: Zdzieciol.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,610
RUBIN PINSKI: In Polish.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,484
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

12
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:41,955
RUBIN PINSKI: In
Russian, it was Dyatlovo.

13
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,040
SANDY HAYDEN: Dyatlovo.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,992
RUBIN PINSKI: And well-known
in the Yiddish name, Zhetel.

15
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:48,600
SANDY HAYDEN: Zhetel.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,020
So how-- how do you--
how do you refer to it?

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,030
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, among
friends and among, uh, people,

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,290
call it Zhetel [INAUDIBLE].

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,794
SANDY HAYDEN: OK, so can
we call it-- can we call it

20
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:00,960
Zhetel during the interview?

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,652
I think--

22
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:02,114
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I think--

23
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:03,500
SANDY HAYDEN: A little
easier for me to say

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,424
Zhetel than Zdzieciol.

25
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:07,400
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, well,
it's a very well-known town.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,820
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, and
um, on the map here, it--

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,070
you explained that to me
a little earlier on that

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,203
it's, um, it has a
number of big cities--

29
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:23,461
RUBIN PINSKI: Big cities around
it, yes, which is [INAUDIBLE]..

30
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:28,040
And, uh, we are also west
of, uh, [INAUDIBLE]----

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,900
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,130
RUBIN PINSKI: --about 150
kilometers between [INAUDIBLE]..

33
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,380
Uh, our town, Zhetel,
was, uh, city's leader.

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,311
It's also well-known city.

35
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:43,760
On the other side
towards Minsk was, uh,

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,356
city in the name of [INAUDIBLE].

37
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,760
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, and did-- did

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,395
you used to travel
often to these cities?

39
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:51,890
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, not often.

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,820
I was very young.

41
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,695
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

42
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:57,230
RUBIN PINSKI: I was just,
uh, uh, school, uh, child.

43
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,245
So I didn't have a chance
to travel too much.

44
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,120
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,620
And how big was-- how many
people were-- were in--

46
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,563
in Zhetel?

47
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:07,680
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the
whole population was only

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,960
about, uh, 7,500 to 8,000.

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,925
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:15,195
RUBIN PINSKI: And at least
60% of them are Jews.

51
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,070
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,670
So you-- you felt that
it was more Jewish--

53
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,130
you felt the Jewish community
very strongly there.

54
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,510
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

55
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:22,890
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

56
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,010
And was sort of Jewish
community was it?

57
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,615
Was it orthodox or?

58
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,260
RUBIN PINSKI:
Well, of all kinds.

59
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,490
Um, the, uh, the youth were
very-- very Zionist-minded.

60
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,090
There was [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
in our town.

61
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,480
The extreme right,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,650
There are also
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

63
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,320
which is socialist.

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,760
Some very few communist
youth, all kinds

65
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,030
of, uh, organizations.

66
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,476
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

67
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,216
And was your family attached
to any organization?

68
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:01,485
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, my
father was religious.

69
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:03,026
SANDY HAYDEN: He
was religious, yeah.

70
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:05,420
SANDY HAYDEN: And
along [INAUDIBLE]

71
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,980
to [INAUDIBLE] Israel.

72
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,440
This is a religious
organization.

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,882
And I-- I finished
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

74
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:20,060
And, uh, also [? learning ?]
in [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,460
which it was called.

76
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,388
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:25,230
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, then I--

78
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,020
when I was 13, I was
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

79
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,170
It was not far from
our town, another town

80
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,198
called [INAUDIBLE].

81
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:40,092
They had a [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
on the, uh,

82
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:42,330
it was called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] from

83
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,510
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

84
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,310
And I was there till--

85
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,570
till 1939.

86
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,770
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

87
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,785
So you-- you had-- you had
really a religious upbringing

88
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:52,284
then?

89
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,700
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
religious, yes.

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,260
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and your
early schooling was just

91
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,910
at in the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
with other young Jewish boys

92
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,420
like you?

93
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,920
RUBIN PINSKI:
[INAUDIBLE] once, yes.

94
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,794
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

95
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:05,520
And-- and you learned
all the subjects--

96
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,310
arithmetic and
reading and writing.

97
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,360
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, this we
learned because the school was

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,270
subsidized by the government.

99
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,970
And we had to do
it to a half a day.

100
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,390
And all these other--

101
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:25,245
other subjects mainly
was [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

102
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,120
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,580
So that was-- half the day was--

104
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,026
was-- was, um, school.

105
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,150
And the half-- other half
of the day was religious.

106
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,590
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

107
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,610
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

108
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,060
And did you, as a young
boy, did you enjoy that?

109
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,490
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

110
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,740
I--

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,430
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, he did.

112
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,650
You just never-- he never
thought, oh, I don't really

113
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,460
like going.

114
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,420
Or it wasn't too-- it-- it
wasn't-- you didn't see other

115
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,020
Jewish boys who maybe had half
the afternoon free because they

116
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,470
weren't going to town with
[INAUDIBLE] something.

117
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,440
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, there was
also a Yiddish [INAUDIBLE]..

118
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,480
And [INAUDIBLE],, as I
said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

119
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,512
Hebrew only.

120
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,075
And, uh, the youth
used to get together,

121
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,456
and we had
discussions for hours,

122
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:06,640
had the discussions,
one with another.

123
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,417
[INAUDIBLE] religious
youth and the--

124
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,848
SANDY HAYDEN: Zionists, yeah.

125
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:15,240
RUBIN PINSKI: The-- the
other real nice gathering

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,194
[INAUDIBLE].

127
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,475
SANDY HAYDEN: And--
and your father--

128
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:22,519
your father let you associate
with all the other Jewish boys,

129
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,810
even if they weren't religious?

130
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:23,950
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

131
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,075
SANDY HAYDEN: That wasn't--

132
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,115
RUBIN PINSKI: It was, uh,
a habit that Saturday.

133
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:32,240
My father used to
take, uh, the, uh,

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,570
children and study
with them [INAUDIBLE]

135
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,514
while other children were
playing football or something

136
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:39,540
like that.

137
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,560
But we had to obli--
oblige to our parents and--

138
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,941
and, uh, and do it for
them because, uh, we

139
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,966
always suspected our parents.

140
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,680
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

141
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,592
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

142
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,159
Saturdays, we used to see people
study with our [INAUDIBLE]..

143
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,450
SANDY HAYDEN: With your father.

144
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,200
RUBIN PINSKI:
Father [INAUDIBLE]..

145
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,393
SANDY HAYDEN: And how many--
how many were in your family?

146
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:03,184
RUBIN PINSKI: Four.

147
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,105
SANDY HAYDEN: Four.

148
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:06,990
Can you tell-- were
you the oldest, or--

149
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,653
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I
was the third one.

150
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:09,980
SANDY HAYDEN: The third one.

151
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,840
RUBIN PINSKI: My
sister was the oldest.

152
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,422
I had a brother and myself,
and I had a younger sister,

153
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:19,680
which perished in the--

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,802
in 1942.

155
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:22,610
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

156
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,810
And, um, what-- what did your
father do as a profession?

157
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,620
RUBIN PINSKI: He used to buy
grain from the farmers, grain

158
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:40,930
and, uh, other things and sell
it in, uh, a bigger wholesale.

159
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,570
He used-- in other words, he
used to buy it from the farmers

160
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,634
to sell it in the--

161
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,330
in the bigger-- in
the bigger wholesale.

162
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,080
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

163
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,680
And so did he sell it-- did
he sell it in-- in the town,

164
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,800
or did he take it to
the bigger cities?

165
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,990
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

166
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,810
He sold it in the
town to someone

167
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,710
who used to buy from everybody.

168
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,690
Also, he used to deal with--

169
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,432


170
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,560
what was it called?

171
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,110
Mushrooms.

172
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,840
Dried mushrooms like--
and all kinds of--

173
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,340
all sorts of the-- the farmers
used to sell in the city.

174
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,790
SANDY HAYDEN: So he used to deal
with all sorts of produce then?

175
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,840
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

176
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,090
SANDY HAYDEN: And your mother?

177
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,689
Can you--

178
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:27,980
RUBIN PINSKI: Just a housewife.

179
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,855
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

180
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:31,390
Can you-- can you
describe your mother?

181
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,580
What you remember.

182
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,120
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,900
Very educated and, uh,
like a Jewish mother,

184
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,540
used to just oblige--

185
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,042
do the housework and, uh,
and raise the children.

186
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,950


187
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,340
Like a real good Jewish mother.

188
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,650
SANDY HAYDEN: Good
Jewish mother, yeah.

189
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,900
And did you have
quite a bit of family,

190
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,430
cousins, and aunts, and uncles?

191
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,180
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

192
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,152
Yes, we had.

193
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:09,212
Um, not far from our house
my-- my mother's sister

194
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:13,848
and her family,
they all perished.

195
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:17,220
And my father's family
was in another city.

196
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,150
It's called [INAUDIBLE]
oh, about 100 kilometers

197
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,900
from us towards, uh, Pinsk.

198
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,869
And he had a brother, and
sisters, and a mother.

199
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:36,728
As a matter of fact, it was only
once in my life in that town

200
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:37,853
where my father comes from.

201
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:38,820
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

202
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,895
RUBIN PINSKI: I was only
eight, nine years old.

203
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,020
SANDY HAYDEN: So they did--

204
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,650
RUBIN PINSKI: I remember it
very vaguely about that town.

205
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,840
SANDY HAYDEN: So you much--

206
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,220
really, you had
much more contact

207
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,110
with your mother's
side of the family.

208
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,096
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

209
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,220
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

210
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,435
you used to spend all
holidays and celebrations?

211
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,833
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we used
to get together on holidays.

212
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,270


213
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,204
And sometimes in the middle
of the week, we used to--

214
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:10,860
I used to play with my
cousins like a normal--

215
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,740
normal way of--

216
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,030
SANDY HAYDEN: Of growing up.

217
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,801
RUBIN PINSKI: A fun
way of growing up, yes.

218
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,220
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- the--

219
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,300
the other 40% of
people who lived

220
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,730
in the town, who were they?

221
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,050
Were they Poles?

222
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,200
RUBIN PINSKI: A lot
of them were farmers.

223
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,000
And some were the, uh--
the administration--

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,820
the Polish administration
like policeman--

225
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,160
there was a magistrate.

226
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,200
It's like a city hall here.

227
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,530
And the, uh, the
mayor was a Pole.

228
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,410
And the secretaries were Poles.

229
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,390
And, uh, there was--
there wasn't a very big

230
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,630
administration in our town.

231
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,965
But, uh, and-- and
enough Poles to--

232
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:07,090
to collect taxes and--

233
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,832
and look after all the, uh--

234
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:12,040
SANDY HAYDEN: Administration.

235
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,840
RUBIN PINSKI: Administration
of the city, yeah.

236
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,131
SANDY HAYDEN: So that's really
all that they did there,

237
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,760
and the Jews were--

238
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,197
the Jews were involved in all
sorts of other professions

239
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:21,696
[INAUDIBLE].

240
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:25,780
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yeah, the Jews
were all kinds of professions.

241
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:34,870
Shoe-- shoemakers, fixing shoes,
and tailors, a lot of tailors,

242
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:42,220
and, uh, storekeepers, like
groceries and selling fabric.

243
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,310
That was also developed
a lot in our town,

244
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,690
selling leather, leather
soles and leather--

245
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,490
the shoes were made by hand.

246
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,240
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

247
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,010
Really?

248
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,030
Everybody's shoes
were made by hand.

249
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,962
RUBIN PINSKI: But there
was only one store--

250
00:10:57,962 --> 00:11:02,890
while I was going up, I
remember started butter shoes.

251
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,590
And one store of
butter shoes opened up,

252
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,740
but until then,
there was no stores,

253
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,586
no shoes where they made shoes.

254
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,710
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, yeah.

255
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,728
RUBIN PINSKI: All made by hand.

256
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,360
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

257
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,640
And-- and-- um, I
suppose that there

258
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,762
were no Jews who were farmers
or landowners around the town.

259
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:27,220
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
there were a few

260
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,480
also had some farms,
not big ones, small--

261
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,120
small farms.

262
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,880
SANDY HAYDEN: So they were
allowed to own the land, and--

263
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,630
RUBIN PINSKI: And they
were doing the same

264
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,361
as other farmers,
but not too many.

265
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,110
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

266
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,142
RUBIN PINSKI: There were in
the villages around the town,

267
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:49,220
there were quite a few
Jews in the farming,

268
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,530
like in the other--

269
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,480
peasant, non-Jews,
peasants, they also

270
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,484
owned a couple of hectares
of land and lived from that.

271
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:01,360
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

272
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,520
RUBIN PINSKI: But in
the town, there was--

273
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,960
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]

274
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,410
RUBIN PINSKI: Mostly the
Jews were like professionals,

275
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,879
like shoemakers, and tailors.

276
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,920
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]

277
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,270
RUBIN PINSKI: And a lot of
Jews were just starting--

278
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,365
sitting and starting
[INAUDIBLE]..

279
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,910
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

280
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,210
And what does-- what
were the relationships

281
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,320
like between the Jews and
the Poles in the town?

282
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,030
RUBIN PINSKI: As a matter fact,
the relationship was very good.

283
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,330
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah?

284
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,670
RUBIN PINSKI: Especially with
the white Russians in our town.

285
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,370
The white Russians
were very nice to us.

286
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,990
The Poles themselves
were anti-Semitic.

287
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,990
SANDY HAYDEN: They were?

288
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,340
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

289
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,517
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
experienced that right from--

290
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,350
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

291
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,474
SANDY HAYDEN: An early age.

292
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:53,700
RUBIN PINSKI: Since Hitler
came to power in 1933, the, uh,

293
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,290
Poles became different.

294
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,617
They were already anti-Semitic.

295
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:58,575
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you--

296
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:01,310
can you remember in what
way they became different?

297
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,345
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, in the
last years in 1937, '38,

298
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:13,660
I remember they used to come
from bigger cities, young Poles

299
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,290
and carrying placards
saying, don't buy from Jews

300
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,560
and, uh, buy from Poles only.

301
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,970
And the anti-Semitism
started already to grow.

302
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,365
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

303
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:30,070
And do you remember-- do you
remember talking about it

304
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,690
as a young boy or hearing
your father and mother

305
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,474
talk about it.

306
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:35,890
Were they worried
about it at all?

307
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,330
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, we all--

308
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,520
we knew already what
actually from the papers,

309
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,910
from the Jewish papers we
used to guess from, uh,

310
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,640
the [INAUDIBLE],, like it was,
uh, produced in, uh, Warsaw.

311
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,330
We used to get these papers.

312
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,980
And we heard what going
on in German, what

313
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,360
the Germans did to the Jews.

314
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,140
So we were already scared.

315
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,890
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

316
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,556
You were worried that that could
start happening in Poland also.

317
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,950
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we were
very worried and scared

318
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,700
in the last few years
before the war broke out.

319
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,450
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

320
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,620
And even though the Jews were
the majority in your town, you

321
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,931
still, the Poles were
still openly anti-Semitic.

322
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:17,930
They weren't scared of--

323
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,650
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

324
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,670
SANDY HAYDEN: --of [INAUDIBLE].

325
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,045
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they were--
they were very anti-Semitic

326
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:25,887
openly, but not actually not
the local Poles, always--

327
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:27,720
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, always
Poles that came by.

328
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,636
RUBIN PINSKI: Came by.

329
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:33,600
And they also planted, uh,
anti-Semitism into the Poles

330
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,010
in our town.

331
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,000
But with the white
Russians, neighbors,

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,300
we lived in very peaceful.

333
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,160
And they were very nice.

334
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,100
SANDY HAYDEN: So when-- when
did all of that start to change?

335
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,160
RUBIN PINSKI: The last couple
of years, uh, before the war

336
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,570
started.

337
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,339
That-- wars, and
wars, and wars always.

338
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,380
SANDY HAYDEN: And with--
with the- white Russians

339
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,570
and the Poles in the town
also or still just the people

340
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,660
who were passing through?

341
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,659
RUBIN PINSKI: The Poles.

342
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,640
And some-- not too
many white Russians

343
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,850
became already a little bit
also with a cold shoulder

344
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,022
toward the Jews.

345
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:21,808
They were already, uh, showing
anti-Semitic, uh, tendencies.

346
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,682


347
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,400
SANDY HAYDEN: And, um, can you--

348
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,720
can you describe what
happened, um, in 1939 when--

349
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,365
when--

350
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:35,090
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, well,
when the war broke out,

351
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:42,600
when the Germans attacked
Poland, the Poles, a lot

352
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,220
of Polish, uh, soldiers were
running through our town

353
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,910
towards Russia.

354
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,610
They were escaping
from the Germans.

355
00:15:52,610 --> 00:16:01,090
And, uh, the war broke out on
the 1st of September, 1939.

356
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:08,460
And I think it was the 17th of
September the Russians came in

357
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,120
from-- from Minsk,
from the other side

358
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,090
and occupied our town.

359
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:21,780
And we came under the Russian
government and the Russian, uh,

360
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,734
occupation.

361
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,150
SANDY HAYDEN: And
did things start

362
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,752
to change very
much at that time?

363
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,460
RUBIN PINSKI: Changed--
it changed very--

364
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,080
very rapidly, yes.

365
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,614
SANDY HAYDEN: How old
were you, um, when the--

366
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:33,530
RUBIN PINSKI: In 1939?

367
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,321
SANDY HAYDEN: 1939.

368
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,640
You mind me asking you?

369
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,460
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I
was only 15 years old.

370
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,944
SANDY HAYDEN: 15 years old.

371
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:39,386
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

372
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:40,270
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

373
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,095
So you were a young-- you
were a young boy then?

374
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:44,490
RUBIN PINSKI: Very young boy.

375
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,603
SANDY HAYDEN: Do
you remember-- do

376
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:46,977
you remember some
of the feelings

377
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:49,242
that you had when-- when--
when the Russians occupied

378
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:49,742
your town?

379
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,230
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, when the
Russians came, I mean, we--

380
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,805
we accepted them with open arms.

381
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,680
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

382
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,230
You mean rather than
have the Germans--

383
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,355
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

384
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,410
We knew what the
Germans did to the Jews.

385
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,589
And they-- they were
actually, uh, liberators.

386
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,566
And they behaved very
nice except some of the--

387
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:13,970
from the rich Jews
took away the--

388
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,910
their stores.

389
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,339
Anybody who had a fabric
store, other kinds of stores,

390
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,050
they confiscated it.

391
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,655
But they let the
people work for them,

392
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:28,089
and they found
jobs for everybody.

393
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,220
And life went on fine.

394
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,720
SANDY HAYDEN: But
you were hearing--

395
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,590
you were hearing reports of
what was going on in Germany.

396
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,390
Can you tell me what some of
the things that you heard in--

397
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,060
RUBIN PINSKI: They used to
hear only from the paper

398
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,570
what the Germans behaved--

399
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,121
did bad to the Germans
Jews, also to the, uh--

400
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:58,680
when we heard the trouble
before the Russians came in.

401
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,270
We knew what's going more
or less on in the paper.

402
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,980
But the Russians concealed
from us everything.

403
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,175
They didn't know what's going
on in the other half of Poland.

404
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,925
SANDY HAYDEN: Really,
once they occupied--

405
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,300
RUBIN PINSKI: Once
they occupied,

406
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,975
we didn't know anything, just--

407
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:17,550
they told us what they
wanted to tell us.

408
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,570
SANDY HAYDEN: So did--
did you feel at any time

409
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,160
that you and your family
would like to escape or to go

410
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,320
to another part of Europe?

411
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,450
Or did you feel
that you would just

412
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,237
stay their for the meantime?

413
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,570
RUBIN PINSKI: Even if you felt--

414
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,010
but we couldn't do anything--

415
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,635
SANDY HAYDEN: You
didn't have a chance.

416
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:36,295
RUBIN PINSKI: --because
the Russian policy was you,

417
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:39,180
uh, if you are not with
us, you are against us.

418
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,990
In other words, if you
want to go away, you are--

419
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,613
you are our enemy.

420
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:45,363
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

421
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,216
So that was dangerous
for you too.

422
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:48,590
RUBIN PINSKI: So
we couldn't even

423
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,150
think of escaping or
going anywhere then.

424
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,390
We didn't have the
money to go too.

425
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,832
There was no-- nowhere to go.

426
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,290
SANDY HAYDEN: But
when the Russians

427
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,270
came to occupy
[INAUDIBLE],, you must

428
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,562
have been at you-- at yeshiva
in the neighboring town?

429
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,770
Or had you come back in town.

430
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,390
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I came back
to our town, because the, uh,

431
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,240
Russians, they didn't exactly--

432
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,490
they didn't say you
can do it, but so--

433
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,310
all the religious issues
disappeared somehow.

434
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,720
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

435
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,350
RUBIN PINSKI: The,
uh, officially,

436
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,970
they didn't say you
cannot go to synagogue,

437
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,210
because the Jews went
to synagogue while, uh--

438
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,120
while they were in occupation.

439
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,880
But somehow, the Jews
alone were afraid to do it.

440
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,840
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

441
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,480
So-- so yeshivas closed down?

442
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,840
RUBIN PINSKI: There was no--
no more yeshivas at all.

443
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,270
And then we-- we um, had
to go to Russian schools

444
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,180
to learn Russian.

445
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,930
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

446
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,330
So that's what you did
when you went back home.

447
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,280
RUBIN PINSKI: That's
what I did, yes.

448
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,030
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were at-- at a school

449
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,840
with Russians and Poles.

450
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,849
And it was now a
mix-- a mixed school.

451
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:05,015
RUBIN PINSKI: Mixed, but
we-- we taught the subjects

452
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:06,550
that are only Russian.

453
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,457
We started a new
language altogether.

454
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,040
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how was-- how was it

455
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,080
going to a school
like that, because it

456
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,510
seems to be very different
from what you were used to?

457
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,590
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, uh, but we--

458
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,640
we could learn,
because the language

459
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:26,630
itself was, uh, was a lot easier
to catch, because the white--

460
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,610
white Russian is
similar to Russian.

461
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,520
Polish is also a bit
similar in a way.

462
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,320
And the-- the writing
and reading was harder,

463
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,270
but the speaking, we
caught on very fast.

464
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,020
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

465
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,864
And how was it to be
in the class with, um,

466
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:47,632
with other children, with the
Russian and Polish children?

467
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:49,840
Did you get on with them,
or was there anti-Semitism?

468
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,870
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

469
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,880
No, no, there was
no anti-Semitism,

470
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,105
because, uh, they--
they knew that uh,

471
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:03,300
the Russians in the
Russian government,

472
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,900
there was no
anti-Semitism at all.

473
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,060
Everybody is the same.

474
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:14,000
And actually, they used to, uh,
punish for anti-Semitic, uh,

475
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,190
the writing--

476
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,910
saying.

477
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,642
They, uh, used to--

478
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,295
people are afraid
to be anti-Semitic.

479
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,170
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

480
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,359
And the Poles also then
were afraid in school

481
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,150
to be anti-Semitic.

482
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,660
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
actually, the Poles,

483
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,520
the few Poles that
were in our town

484
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,040
disappeared, the ones that were
in the administration before.

485
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,615
And the-- the Polish
farmers behaved like, uh,

486
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:44,390
like they have to behave
under the Russian occupation.

487
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,470
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

488
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,485
So how many years was--
were you under occupation

489
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,360
by the Russian forces?

490
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,800
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, from
1939, from September 1939

491
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,820
till the outbreak of the
war at the 22nd of June,

492
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,560
1941 when Hitler
attacked Russia.

493
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,310
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

494
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,729
So that was two years.

495
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:08,020
RUBIN PINSKI: Nearly two years.

496
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,046
SANDY HAYDEN: Right,
nearly two years, yeah.

497
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:09,760
RUBIN PINSKI: Two years, yes.

498
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,218
SANDY HAYDEN: And in a way, it
sounds like your life didn't

499
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:13,860
change too much in those tears.

500
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,490
The everyday living
didn't change too much.

501
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,925
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, it
did change in, uh, in uh,

502
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:24,930
the way that, from one
government to the other,

503
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:31,920
which, uh, the Russians had
started to, uh, put in us--

504
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,450
teach-- teach us-- teach us
their ways that you cannot be

505
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,325
in the, uh, dealings or any,
uh, you cannot own a store.

506
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:44,294
You can-- you can't,
uh, be for your own.

507
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:45,960
Everything has to be
for the government.

508
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,600
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

509
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,910
RUBIN PINSKI: Now what you have
to work for the government.

510
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,660
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

511
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,370
So it was more
Marxist or socialist.

512
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,315
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

513
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:55,130
They tried to teach us.

514
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,886
But it wasn't so easy to
absorb in the beginning.

515
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:01,340
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, so that
was a bit difficult for--

516
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,640
for all of you.

517
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,160
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right,
but it was at least safe.

518
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,910
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

519
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,610
And was your father
able to continue

520
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,872
doing what he had been doing?

521
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:09,580
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

522
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,705
SANDY HAYDEN: What-- what--

523
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:13,940
what did he-- what
happened to his work then?

524
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,480
RUBIN PINSKI: He, uh, he
used to buy, well, not

525
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,450
exactly the same way as to--

526
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,830
before used to buy direct
from the farmers and--

527
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,780
and sell it.

528
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,000
And here he had to work
for the government.

529
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,250
He used to buy also
from the farmers,

530
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,570
but, uh, like in a
cooperative sort of.

531
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,520
He used to write down
everything he buys

532
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,150
and, uh, pay out the farmers.

533
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,120
He worked for the
government, in other words.

534
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,661
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how-- how was that?

535
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,327
Was that a big change for him?

536
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:48,910
RUBIN PINSKI: He got
used to it first.

537
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,413
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

538
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,840
But it was-- it was all right.

539
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,464
RUBIN PINSKI: Before
that change, yeah.

540
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:54,381
But we got used to it.

541
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,255
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

542
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:57,080
Did that mean that,
materially, that you

543
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,330
had less in your family
than you were used to?

544
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,170
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
uh, a little bit less,

545
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,880
but it wasn't too bad.

546
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,062
It was enough to get by.

547
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:07,826
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

548
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:10,580
So food, and
clothing, and shoes,

549
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,050
and all that sort of thing
during the Russian occupation

550
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,190
wasn't-- was that-- was
not too much of a problem.

551
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,930
You never--

552
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,670
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, it was
a problem, because it never

553
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,170
brought in anything.

554
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:22,990
They took away.

555
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,940
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

556
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,010
RUBIN PINSKI: Anything
that was produced,

557
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,100
they took away from our
town and sent into Russia.

558
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,770
But, uh, we never
brought anything.

559
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,660
If they did bring
something, you had

560
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,120
to stand in, uh, a queue
for-- for hours to get it.

561
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,860
But we didn't complain.

562
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,350
It was-- they let us live.

563
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,440
That was-- that was
the main good thing

564
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,870
about the Russian occupation.

565
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,620
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

566
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,110
So you were just hoping that
that would continue right

567
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,727
until--

568
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,560
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

569
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,190
SANDY HAYDEN: But then in 1941--

570
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:05,060
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941, when Hitler
attacked, uh, Russia, our city

571
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,970
was taken by the
Germans officially

572
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,150
until the 8th of June, 1941.

573
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,900
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

574
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,080
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was eight days later.

575
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,360
And in the eight
days, the, uh, there

576
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:28,265
were some battles close to our
town with the, uh, the, uh,

577
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:31,590
Russians who were running
away with the Germans who

578
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:38,710
were coming as parachutists.

579
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,570
The-- actually
they didn't take--

580
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,130
the Germans didn't occupy
our town as a full army.

581
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:51,470
But, uh, the, uh, they
parachuted behind the town

582
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,830
and attacked all the, uh,
running away trucks and, uh,

583
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,630
and tanks from the Russian.

584
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,380
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

585
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,389
So there was--

586
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:01,430
RUBIN PINSKI: Eight days.

587
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,930
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, so there
was fighting around your town

588
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,890
for-- for eight days.

589
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,806
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah, so
fighting about eight days.

590
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:07,681
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

591
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,885
And what was it like
during those eight days.

592
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,664
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
it was very bad.

593
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,738
The, uh, the Jews,
uh, not only do

594
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:17,196
the whole population couldn't
get out of the houses, hiding

595
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:18,873
in the houses.

596
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:24,400
And they did get out
the, uh, the planes

597
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,250
shooting over the head,
the German planes.

598
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,520
In other words, uh,
most people were hiding.

599
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,270
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

600
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,090
And you must-- do you rem--

601
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,570
I mean, you must have been
very frightened about it.

602
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,362
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
frightened, yes.

603
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,112
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you
remember the feeling?

604
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:40,660
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
yes, I remember.

605
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,149
I used to hide even
in the basement.

606
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:44,690
SANDY HAYDEN: With
your whole family?

607
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,290
RUBIN PINSKI: The whole family
for days till-- till the, uh,

608
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,296
shooting got a little
bit, uh, eased.

609
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:55,180
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

610
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,462
And during those
eight days, do you--

611
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,920
I mean, were you
worried about what

612
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,470
was going to happen now
that the Russians had left?

613
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,890
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
the uh, we knew

614
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:11,360
that it's not so good that
the Germans occupied the, uh,

615
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,550
living will be, uh,
bad [INAUDIBLE]..

616
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,745
We knew what to expect.

617
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:17,870
SANDY HAYDEN: You did know?

618
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,450
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

619
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,450
SANDY HAYDEN: Was this--

620
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,280
how hard-- how-- how did
you know this information,

621
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
because you--

622
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,190
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we knew what they do--

623
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,950
they did in Germany
or in Poland.

624
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,090
So we knew what to expect.

625
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,410
And so it happened.

626
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,160
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

627
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,680
Can you-- can you
tell us what happened

628
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,124
from the time the
Germans occupied?

629
00:27:35,124 --> 00:27:36,456
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

630
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:40,090
The German soldiers,
they came in the town.

631
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:46,140
They-- they were very careful
walking by houses singularly.

632
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,360
They, uh, first
came in without--

633
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,910
without, uh, cars, or tanks,
or just occupied the city.

634
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,595
And, uh, immediately,
they started,

635
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:07,530
um, they started to
ask the, uh, some

636
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,010
of the, uh, Polish or white--

637
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,520
or the-- or the
non-Jewish population

638
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,260
where are-- where the Jews are.

639
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,250
And they asked for food from
the Jews and asked for bicycles.

640
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,000
SANDY HAYDEN: And you
gave it all to them?

641
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,305
RUBIN PINSKI: Everything.

642
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:25,200
SANDY HAYDEN: They had to, yeah.

643
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,575
RUBIN PINSKI: They
had no choice.

644
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:27,390
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

645
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,920
RUBIN PINSKI: And they had--

646
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,690
right away, the Germans
had some of the, uh,

647
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,200
of the town's inhabitants.

648
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,886
Some of them where they
with them, helping them,

649
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:47,130
uh, showing them the
Jewish, uh, houses.

650
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,460
And they went and robbed,
and beat, and uh, and--

651
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,400
the three days
after the, uh, they

652
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,140
had already with them
some, um, placards

653
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,840
hanging out in, uh, three
languages-- in German,

654
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,980
in Russian, and,
uh, and uh, Polish.

655
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,878
All de-- decrees against Jews.

656
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:17,753
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

657
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:18,700
Yeah.

658
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,260
RUBIN PINSKI: That the Jews,
uh, cannot walk on the sidewalk.

659
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,570
They cannot, uh,
possess, uh, fur coats.

660
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,620
He cannot-- they
cannot have any gold.

661
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,350
They have to give it
away to the Germans--

662
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:41,340
and a long list of
decrees against Jews.

663
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,690
So we knew right away
the trouble started.

664
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,400


665
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:54,170
And, uh, slowly, the Jews
started to come out of the--

666
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,450
of the hiding.

667
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:06,720
And-- and, uh, the, uh, Germans
gave every day new orders

668
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,800
to, uh, collect food and
collect clothes for them.

669
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,080
And then in the, uh, third
week was in July the 5th.

670
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,920
SANDY HAYDEN: At that
time, had they, um,

671
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,130
had there been any brutality?

672
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,320
Had there been-- had
they killed any Jews

673
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,510
during those three weeks?

674
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,700
Or had they just beaten them up?

675
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,630
RUBIN PINSKI: They killed--

676
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:34,500
they made like, um,
6 o'clock was curfew.

677
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,412
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

678
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:37,650
RUBIN PINSKI: And nobody
could go-- get out

679
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,940
of the house at 6
o'clock in the evening.

680
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,960
It wasn't evening yet.

681
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,550
So in several cases, some
Jews walked to one house

682
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,156
to the other.

683
00:30:51,156 --> 00:30:52,031
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

684
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:54,320
RUBIN PINSKI: After six of
them got shot right way.

685
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,060
In other words,
non-Jews weren't shot.

686
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,950
But Jews are shot
for-- for that.

687
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,010
That was the-- several
Jews were shot that way.

688
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:11,640
But then on the 15th of
July, the, uh, the uh,

689
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,920
order to make Judenrat.

690
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,920
In other words, they picked
10 of the best Jews from town

691
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,010
and--

692
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,310
and ordered them
to have a Judenrat

693
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,400
and have a Jewish police.

694
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,402
And, uh, then the, uh,
the next day, the--

695
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:34,860
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you know--
you knew some of the people who

696
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,225
were elected to the Judenrat?

697
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:38,320
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

698
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,610
Actually, the best, uh, the
best, uh, people from the city.

699
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:49,390
One was a lawyer called Alter
Dvoretsky was a young man.

700
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,850
He was very capable.

701
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,970
He was at the head
of the Judenrat

702
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:59,987
and, uh, several of
religious Jews [INAUDIBLE]..

703
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,070
SANDY HAYDEN: So they--
they were all good people.

704
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,170
RUBIN PINSKI: All-- a
better class of people.

705
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,340
As a matter of fact,
the rabbi for our town

706
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,220
was also included in that.

707
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,390
And the men on the
15h of July, it

708
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,730
was only two weeks
after they occup--

709
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,920
they came in, they,
uh, sent the police

710
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,370
to tell all the Jews to
come on the marketplace,

711
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:37,110
to get on the market place
from the age of 16 to 60.

712
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,970
Actually, they said
officially 16 to 60,

713
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,220
but whenever they
caught younger ones,

714
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,720
they also pushed
to the marketplace.

715
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,880
And, uh, on that--

716
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,350
on that, uh, marketplace,
the Gestapo came in.

717
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,690
They had a-- a table
and the market chairs.

718
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,080
And they had a
big list of people

719
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,550
who they called and said,
anybody will be called out

720
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,852
should go forward.

721
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,000
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

722
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,160
RUBIN PINSKI: And that way,
they took away 120 people.

723
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,920
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

724
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,306
What sort of people were they?

725
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:16,100
All men or--

726
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,010
RUBIN PINSKI: All men and
the better-- the better

727
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,122
class of people from the
city, and the-- and the

728
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:32,610
uh, the richer and, uh, more
learned, and they packed them

729
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,415
in talks.

730
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:35,790
SANDY HAYDEN: How
do you-- how do

731
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,998
you think they got that list?

732
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:37,980
Who gave them the list?

733
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,900
RUBIN PINSKI: The, uh, the
list was helped by the, uh,

734
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,960
local, by local
collaborators to the Germans.

735
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,880
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

736
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,960
Who knew the people in
the-- the Jewish people.

737
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,030
RUBIN PINSKI: They
knew everybody.

738
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,560
As a matter of fact,
in [INAUDIBLE],,

739
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,490
in the Hebrew school,
there was a janitor,

740
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,673
and he could speak Yiddish
just as good as any Jew.

741
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:04,440
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

742
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,490
RUBIN PINSKI: And he was
right away with the Germans

743
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:15,110
and gave out all the Jews
who were, uh, known in the--

744
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,710
in the town .

745
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,770


746
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,860
And, uh, they took--
they said they

747
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,500
are going to take this, uh, 120
people to work in Nowogrodek.

748
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,840
Nowogrodek is a bigger city than
us about 38 kilometers away.

749
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,484
But we found out later that they
were shot in the Nowogrodek.

750
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:43,540
SANDY HAYDEN: And when
did you find that out?

751
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,279
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we found out from--

752
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:50,460
from peasants, which saw it.

753
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,730
SANDY HAYDEN: So that was
the first really bad atrocity

754
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,230
that--

755
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,190
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

756
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,140
That was only two weeks
after they entered our town.

757
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:07,090
And, uh, the kids saw all
kinds of, uh, every day they

758
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:12,280
demanded from us something
else, the Germans.

759
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:21,204
The, uh, or-- we organized
work like there was, uh,

760
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:25,380
a highway the Russians
started and didn't finish.

761
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,460
So they, uh, took
men who could-- well,

762
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,560
they were a little stronger
to work on that highway.

763
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,731
And I was also, uh,
working on that highway.

764
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,730
SANDY HAYDEN: Because
then you were a young man.

765
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,010
You were 16, 17.

766
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,960
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
young and strong, and--

767
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,310
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

768
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,810
RUBIN PINSKI: And
I wanted to leave,

769
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,960
and they gave out
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

770
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,700
[SPEAKING GERMAN] means
some kind of a document.

771
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,460
There was-- it went
by the column more

772
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,730
the people who were
stronger hard workers had

773
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,730
a red [SPEAKING GERMAN].

774
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,250
Some had green
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

775
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,610
And, uh, the people--

776
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,050
the Jews were very,
uh, wanted very

777
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,074
much to get [SPEAKING GERMAN].

778
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:12,573
So--

779
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,360
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

780
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,330
So you had-- you had a red one?

781
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,560
RUBIN PINSKI: I have a good
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, yes.

782
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,290
SANDY HAYDEN: You
had a good one.

783
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,350
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

784
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,440
SANDY HAYDEN: How were you
chosen to-- to go and work?

785
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,807
RUBIN PINSKI: I,
uh, actually, they

786
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:32,670
were asking for volunteers,
and, uh, I wanted for this job,

787
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,070
so I worked on the--

788
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,000
on the, uh, building
that highway.

789
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,750
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

790
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,340
And your brothers?

791
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,170
RUBIN PINSKI: My
brother wasn't with me.

792
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,860
He was, uh-- he
was already taken--

793
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,110
before the at-- the
Germans attacked,

794
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,005
he was taken to
the Russian Army.

795
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,630
SANDY HAYDEN: How--
who-- who took him?

796
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,136
Was he conscripted
to the Russian Army?

797
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:55,010
RUBIN PINSKI: No, no.

798
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,400
He was already of age.

799
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,030
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh, oh, I see.

800
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,400
RUBIN PINSKI: He
was born in 19--

801
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
SANDY HAYDEN: So he was in--

802
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,148
RUBIN PINSKI: 20.

803
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:04,430
He was 18 years old,
and he was taken legally

804
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,382
to the Russian Army.

805
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:05,860
SANDY HAYDEN: To
the Russian Army.

806
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,520
Uh-huh.

807
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,110
So had you-- did you keep--

808
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,520
manage to keep correspondence
with him during that time?

809
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,480
RUBIN PINSKI: It wasn't very--

810
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,070
it was right before the war.

811
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,700
All we heard-- we had only one
letter from him that is going

812
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,210
into--

813
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,640
deep into Russia.

814
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,065
And then we were
apart for six years.

815
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:26,940
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

816
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,773
So you didn't know what
had happened to you.

817
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,860
RUBIN PINSKI: We
found him in 1946.

818
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,902
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

819
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:35,360
So that was-- that must have
been very hard for your mother

820
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,020
and father.

821
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,952
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

822
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:37,418
SANDY HAYDEN: It
would be really--

823
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:38,820
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

824
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,680
SANDY HAYDEN: And your sister?

825
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,179
And--

826
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:43,950
RUBIN PINSKI: The sister was
the whole time with me together.

827
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,230
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

828
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,570
And then your younger brother.

829
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,850
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
my younger sister.

830
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,558
SANDY HAYDEN: Your
younger sister, sorry.

831
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,590
RUBIN PINSKI: I didn't
tell [INAUDIBLE]..

832
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:59,170
She perished in, uh, in 1942
in August together the parents.

833
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,860
SANDY HAYDEN: So your father--

834
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,320
when the Germans
came, your father

835
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,257
stopped, um, working, and--

836
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:07,090
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

837
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,485
SANDY HAYDEN: You were the
only one that was really,

838
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:12,447
um, working on the highway.

839
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,030
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
the only one, yes.

840
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,540
SANDY HAYDEN: So-- what-- what--

841
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,270
what were you getting
paid in any way?

842
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,630
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

843
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:17,990
No.

844
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,380
SANDY HAYDEN: Did they feed you?

845
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,296
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they
didn't pay us anything.

846
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:21,298
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

847
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:24,020
RUBIN PINSKI: Uh, the--

848
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:33,830
the, uh, in 1941 on
November, the Germans

849
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,360
told us to leave our houses
and go into a ghetto.

850
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,730
They made a ghetto.

851
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,110
The Jews themselves had to
make a fence, a wired fence,

852
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,940
around it.

853
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,590
And at that time, uh, we
could only take with us

854
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,937
whatever we could--

855
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:53,770
SANDY HAYDEN: Carry.

856
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,603
RUBIN PINSKI: Carry.

857
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:55,550
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

858
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,620
RUBIN PINSKI: And
it happened that we

859
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,810
had a big-- a very
big garden and used

860
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:07,150
to have enough
potatoes to put it

861
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:12,470
in a big hole covered
with earth and hide it

862
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,120
for the next spring.

863
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,300
That was done actually
normal times too.

864
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,620
SANDY HAYDEN: Right.

865
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,600
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

866
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:28,380
all the potato that we got from,
uh, before the winter came,

867
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,160
we bur--

868
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,750
we buried it in the garden.

869
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:42,110
And, um, so in Spring
of 1942 in the ghetto,

870
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,200
I had that chance I--

871
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,783
to open that hole and--

872
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:46,532
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

873
00:39:46,532 --> 00:39:49,430
RUBIN PINSKI: --put in the
potatoes in the ghetto so we

874
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,150
could have--

875
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,580
SANDY HAYDEN: Some food?

876
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,050
RUBIN PINSKI: Some
food for a while.

877
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:59,160
The whole-- the whole, uh, all
the inhabitants of that house,

878
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,842
we shared.

879
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:08,200
We used to bring in
like, uh, hiding it in--

880
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,280
in a way that the Germans
shouldn't see that they

881
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,401
carried potatoes in this--

882
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,400
SANDY HAYDEN: How did
you-- how did you do that?

883
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,410
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, we
into the night, at night,

884
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,120
and brought it in.

885
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,820
The houses that the
Germans confiscated was--

886
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,540
in the front of the house
was some sort of, uh--

887
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:33,130
uh, a list that,
uh, but this house

888
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,640
is confiscated by the Germans.

889
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,960
In the front, they couldn't
get in, but from the back--

890
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
SANDY HAYDEN: You could?

891
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,690
RUBIN PINSKI:
--you could get in.

892
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,970
But it didn't do anything.

893
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,020
A lot of Jewish houses
were occupied by--

894
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,530
by, uh, local, uh, non-Jews.

895
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,940
But some of them are still--

896
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,720
our house was still
empty standing there.

897
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,470
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

898
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,920
So you could sneak in at night.

899
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,330
RUBIN PINSKI: I used
to sneak in every night

900
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,450
and bring a little
bit of potatoes

901
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,080
that I could carry myself.

902
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,980
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

903
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,080
RUBIN PINSKI: And that's--

904
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,810
that's how we could
live for a while.

905
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,070
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm And what
were the living conditions

906
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,990
like in the ghetto?

907
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,095
RUBIN PINSKI: Very bad.

908
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:09,410
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

909
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,201
Can you-- can you
describe it a little bit?

910
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:15,340
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they
packed in in the house,

911
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:20,560
in a little house, about 800
square feet or 900 square feet.

912
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,067
They packed in about 60 people,
one on top of the other.

913
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,400
SANDY HAYDEN: And that's how
you and your family lived--

914
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,940
lived with another--

915
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,080
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, yes.

916
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,740
SANDY HAYDEN: --50 people or so.

917
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,100
RUBIN PINSKI: In the
basement and on top on the--

918
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,360
under the roof, people,
one on top of the other,

919
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,490
and the conditions in the
ghetto was very bad, dirty,

920
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,252
and no food.

921
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:47,002
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

922
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:49,180
And-- and lice also.

923
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,421
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

924
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:53,300
SANDY HAYDEN: And what--
what did the people,

925
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,730
the leaders of the
ghetto, of the Judenrat,

926
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,650
were they fair in the way they--

927
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,495
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they were
very fair, but they were also--

928
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:05,470
they had the same,
uh, goals we did.

929
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,940
They were also afraid
of-- the Germans used them

930
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,370
just to get their way.

931
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,460
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

932
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,310
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, this
out-- this Alter Dvoretsky

933
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,480
is from the Judenrat.

934
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,890
He organized a partisan
group in the ghetto.

935
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,200
And anybody who
could be of help--

936
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,060
used everybody that
could be of help.

937
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,210
Only the young
people he mobilized.

938
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,960
And myself was working in the
highway, building the highway.

939
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,056
I had a chance to bring into
the ghetto parts, uh, weapons.

940
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:47,720
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

941
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,402
RUBIN PINSKI: So we used to
tie it in bundles of wood.

942
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:54,860
SANDY HAYDEN: So
they wouldn't see.

943
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,242
RUBIN PINSKI: To carry it in.

944
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,940
And, uh, I used to take
chances to bring in parts

945
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,484
of rifles and ammunition.

946
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:11,140
And from time to time,
the Germans used to check

947
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,380
everybody-- every bundle of--

948
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,171
SANDY HAYDEN: Wood?

949
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:16,265
RUBIN PINSKI: Of wood,
or on the person.

950
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:19,359
Anybody that was found with
something was shot right away.

951
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,150
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were lucky you never--

952
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:21,870
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I was lucky.

953
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,610
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE].

954
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,276
It must have been
frightening each time.

955
00:43:24,276 --> 00:43:25,680
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, I mean--

956
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,440
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, it's a risk.

957
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,686
RUBIN PINSKI: I risked
with my life all the time.

958
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:29,892
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

959
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:31,850
So you joined the partisan
group in the ghetto.

960
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,250
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

961
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:33,869
[INAUDIBLE]

962
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:34,660
SANDY HAYDEN: 194--

963
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,590
1941?

964
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,714
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941.

965
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,588
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

966
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:40,420
RUBIN PINSKI: We organized the--

967
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,975
in the basement, we used
to put together the rifles.

968
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:46,100
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

969
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,296
did you use them?

970
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:48,230
What-- what-- what--

971
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,936
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I didn't
have a chance to use,

972
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:54,750
and practically, nobody
had a chance, only--

973
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,170
only a few young
boys, uh, were, uh,

974
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,449
fighting against
them in the second--

975
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:07,910
not in the second time when
the Germans killed the Jews.

976
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,346
The Germans killed,
uh, about half

977
00:44:12,346 --> 00:44:13,970
of the Jewish population
in the ghettos

978
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:18,600
they killed in 1941
till the end of April.

979
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,000
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, I-- can you--

980
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,750
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

981
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,685
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you tell
me a little bit about--

982
00:44:21,685 --> 00:44:23,268
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was a very bad day.

983
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:26,060
Then my parents were--

984
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,770
got killed killed and my sister.

985
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:36,380
Uh, it was the 30th of
April, 1941, and the Germans,

986
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,786
with the help [INAUDIBLE]
of the Ukrainian police,

987
00:44:41,786 --> 00:44:49,100
so there were a few white
Russian police also surrounded

988
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,560
the ghetto.

989
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,504
And, uh, very early in the
morning, about 5 o'clock

990
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:56,670
in the morning, they started
to knock on the windows

991
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:01,310
and scream [SPEAKING GERMAN].

992
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,655
And, uh, they told
us to gather in

993
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:08,460
that, uh, it was an old cem--

994
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,510
Jewish cemetery
near the, uh, the

995
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,620
synagogues and told
us to gather there,

996
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,570
all the Jews should together.

997
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,900
And I came there.

998
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:27,230
We, uh-- they told us to
stand in families, each family

999
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,540
together, all the families.

1000
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,720
So I had that red
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,

1001
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,810
which was considered
to be a good sign.

1002
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,750
And I had a friend who also
had a good [SPEAKING GERMAN],,

1003
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,010
so I told him to take
my sister, saying

1004
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,920
that this wife and I wanted
to rescue my family, my father

1005
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,055
and mother.

1006
00:45:53,055 --> 00:46:00,150
I remember they started to
select the, uh, I showed him

1007
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,170
the [SPEAKING GERMAN].

1008
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:07,090
So he said, [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
to the right, which was good.

1009
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:14,120
And right after, a couple
steps from this Gestapo man,

1010
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,470
stood other Gestapo
people, looked

1011
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:22,460
at the [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
and they let me go through

1012
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,225
and apparently chased
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,

1013
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:27,830
in other words--

1014
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,450
SANDY HAYDEN: To--
to the bad line.

1015
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,705
RUBIN PINSKI: To--
to get killed.

1016
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:37,490
They said to resettle for
labor or something else,

1017
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,761
but they took them
behind the town.

1018
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:42,010
SANDY HAYDEN: And there was
nothing that you could do.

1019
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,630
RUBIN PINSKI:
Nothing I could do.

1020
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:47,260
And my sister went
with that, uh,

1021
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,920
my friend who had a good
[SPEAKING GERMAN] too,

1022
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,902
and she was, uh, rescued.

1023
00:46:54,902 --> 00:46:55,860
SANDY HAYDEN: Is that--

1024
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,068
that day must be a very hard
day for you to remember.

1025
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,450
RUBIN PINSKI: A
very bad day, yeah.

1026
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,530
They killed half of the
Jewish population in one day,

1027
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,990
and then they
shortened the ghetto.

1028
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,750
They cut it in half.

1029
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:18,784
In other words, the, uh, all
the edges around the ghetto,

1030
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:21,520
and they told the Jews--

1031
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,356
for the Jews to put an
electric fence closer inside.

1032
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:31,760
And I continued to
work on that highway.

1033
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,770
SANDY HAYDEN:
And-- and the Jews,

1034
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,180
your family and the other
Jews, were they taken?

1035
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,340
What happened to them?

1036
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,804
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
they were taken.

1037
00:47:39,804 --> 00:47:41,220
They were led
through the streets.

1038
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:48,910
They were taken behind the
town, and forced to undress,

1039
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,150
and the, uh, the graves
were already dug.

1040
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:58,570
It was already ready,
and they shot 50 people

1041
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,055
at a time right--

1042
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:05,095
right on top of the cliff.

1043
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:06,602
They were all killed.

1044
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:08,560
SANDY HAYDEN: What went
through your mind then?

1045
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,910
Did you feel like you wanted
to avenge their deaths?

1046
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,640
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that's the only thing

1047
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,820
was in my mind to avenge.

1048
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,800
Well, I never believed
I'll stay alive.

1049
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,950
But at least I should be
able to avenge for the--

1050
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,110
for what they did.

1051
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,314
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

1052
00:48:26,314 --> 00:48:28,480
Something that-- has that
stayed-- the feeling of it

1053
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,146
stayed with you?

1054
00:48:29,146 --> 00:48:30,550
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I still--

1055
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,550
the feeling never changed.

1056
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:41,420
Well, I can't feel exactly the
same as I felt then, but I, uh,

1057
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,220
had that feeling all the time.

1058
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,410
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and so
what happened after that day?

1059
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,594
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the, uh,
the ghetto was shortened.

1060
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:57,130
The Judenrat actually
was also killed.

1061
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,490
They told to the Judenrat.

1062
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,350


1063
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:10,650
And, uh, they kept us
alive till August--

1064
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:17,700
August 6th, 1942,
and, uh, August 6th ,

1065
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,690
1942 happened the same thing.

1066
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:27,230
The-- the Germans and
the Ukrainian police

1067
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,820
surrounded-- surrounded
the, uh, the ghetto

1068
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,180
and chased everybody
out in the marketplace.

1069
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,235
But, uh, at that
time, I didn't--

1070
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:40,800
I didn't run anymore to the--

1071
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,990
on the marketplace
we were hiding.

1072
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,740
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

1073
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,680
Who-- who is we?

1074
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,180
You?

1075
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,013
You and your sister.

1076
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:51,030
RUBIN PINSKI: I, and my
sister, and my cousin,

1077
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,310
two cousins of mine.

1078
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,675
We were hiding in a--

1079
00:49:56,675 --> 00:50:03,190
we-- we actually dug a
hiding place under the floor.

1080
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:10,310
But being so close to the, uh,
ghetto gate of the [INAUDIBLE]

1081
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,710
was the Germans where, the
other side of the ghetto, they

1082
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:20,444
had their, uh, the officers.

1083
00:50:20,444 --> 00:50:23,350
We were afraid that close--

1084
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,840
close-- being
close to the ghetto

1085
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,305
would be a lot worse if
they start digging with

1086
00:50:29,305 --> 00:50:33,900
or searching with, uh, dogs.

1087
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,590
So we were running--

1088
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,300
we were running in a
place where my cousin

1089
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,680
was working as a carpenter.

1090
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,950
And the-- the-- it
was inside the ghetto.

1091
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,270
You could get in from inside
and from outside the ghetto.

1092
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:58,720
The, uh-- in other words,
the, uh, there was--

1093
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,010
the back of the building
was inside the ghetto.

1094
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,170
The front of the building
was out of the ghetto.

1095
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,950
So we were running there
and running-- and hiding

1096
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:08,650
in the basement.

1097
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,140
There wasn't a
dark place to hide,

1098
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:18,510
but a plain, little basement
and a tiny, little window.

1099
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:24,240
And we got into the basement
and about 15 people there.

1100
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,920
Some came also running
at that the place.

1101
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,690
We are hiding there a whole day,
and through the little window,

1102
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,350
you could see that--

1103
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:40,150
the way the Germans chased
the Jews to the marketplace

1104
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,260
and beating them.

1105
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:50,753
And, uh, towards evening, at
night, we tried to get to--

1106
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:54,430
we tried to get out of there,
because we knew we cannot stay

1107
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:57,570
there overnight.

1108
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,735
And, uh, somehow everybody
wants to get out first

1109
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:07,962
and started to commotion
inside when the,

1110
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:14,010
uh, the Germans with the
Lithuanians and the Ukrainians

1111
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:20,590
were all helping the Germans,
uh, in the gathering the Jews.

1112
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,682
They heard noise
in the building.

1113
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:29,390
And they, uh, first opened
the door, and they caught us.

1114
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,630
And, uh, my cousin
was a carpenter and I

1115
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,820
started to beg the Germans as--

1116
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,036
let us live.

1117
00:52:38,036 --> 00:52:40,210
I-- I could carpent--

1118
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,310
I can.

1119
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:46,240
So the German
answered, yeah, yeah.

1120
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,412
Tomorrow, we will take
you to the new house.

1121
00:52:50,412 --> 00:52:53,405
In other words, we knew that
they were going to shoot us.

1122
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:57,800
And they pushed us in
back into the basement

1123
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,270
and put a heavy
table on top of it.

1124
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:09,830
And, uh, outside they put
a post working, watching,

1125
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:15,800
watching the uh, the outside
in the little window.

1126
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,580
But to our-- to
our luck, the posts

1127
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,250
sat down close to the
window and fell asleep.

1128
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,650
And the, uh, the window
was too small for anybody

1129
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,290
to get-- to crawl through.

1130
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,980
So we-- we stretched out all
the cement around the window

1131
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:41,850
and made a bigger hole, and
slowly, we took out the shoes,

1132
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,950
and slowly we--

1133
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,270
SANDY HAYDEN: Escaped, yeah.

1134
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,530
RUBIN PINSKI: We, uh,
called out, and we, uh,

1135
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,707
said that we'll--

1136
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:53,780
we'll meet right in, uh, that.

1137
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,470
A little river was
running close by,

1138
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:02,310
and we said we shouldn't
walk with the streets.

1139
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,780
We should, uh, go with the
river, which takes us out

1140
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,930
in the outskirts of
the-- of the town.

1141
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,492
And that way, we--

1142
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:12,310
SANDY HAYDEN: So
you all escaped.

1143
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,320
RUBIN PINSKI: Not all.

1144
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,760
An older woman couldn't make it.

1145
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,920
Two-- two people still, because
they found only two people

1146
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,520
there in the--

1147
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,936
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.
in the morning.

1148
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:27,350
RUBIN PINSKI: --in the
basement the next day.

1149
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:35,740
They escaped, and we wandered
around for, um, for, um,

1150
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,680
until--

1151
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,040
until it got, uh, light.

1152
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,695
They escaped, my sister,
and I, and my two cousins

1153
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:51,340
were running together, and
they came not very far.

1154
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,400
They ran away about 10
kilometers out of town.

1155
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,360
And it was already light.

1156
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,590
We couldn't walk any further,
so we were hiding a little--

1157
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:06,408
the little forest was very--

1158
00:55:06,408 --> 00:55:09,880
it wasn't-- it was a very
dangerous place to stay.

1159
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,630
But we crawled into a bush.

1160
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,860
We were hiding there.

1161
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,080
And the shepherds could--

1162
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,580
uh, we could see the
shepherds in the morning.

1163
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:26,290
And somehow, we are lucky
that nobody noticed us

1164
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,770
the whole day.

1165
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:34,540
So the next evening,
we were trying

1166
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:40,900
to get food into the
forest, because the, uh,

1167
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,205
the forest around our
town was only about,

1168
00:55:46,205 --> 00:55:50,029
uh, 4 to 20 kilometers away.

1169
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:52,570
SANDY HAYDEN: Were you planning
then to join partisan groups?

1170
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,480
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that was the main idea,

1171
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,610
to join the partisans.

1172
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:04,720
And, uh, the next night, we
came towards the, uh, forest

1173
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,150
where the partisans were.

1174
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:14,110
But talking to a peasant,
we knocked on the door,

1175
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,230
and eh opened the door
to us, and he said--

1176
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:23,930
he gave us bad news that
the Russian partisans are--

1177
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:29,480
they are anti-Semitic, and they
killed some Jewish partisans,

1178
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,040
which was the leader,
Alter Dvoretsky.

1179
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:41,950
He was killed, and he suggested
we should go into, uh,

1180
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:45,422
there was a [SPEAKING GERMAN]
like a working--

1181
00:56:45,422 --> 00:56:51,160
uh, it was a camp, which
was about 30 kilometers

1182
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,930
from our town, and the town
was called [INAUDIBLE]..

1183
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:01,150
And, uh, there the Germans
need these people, the Jews,

1184
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:04,330
to build for them an airport.

1185
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:10,720
And it was a chance to stay
alive as that farmer suggested.

1186
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,260
And we took his advice, and
we went towards that, uh,

1187
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,220
camp, which was--

1188
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,850
together was about 33
kilometers to make.

1189
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:27,490
So to the next,
towards [INAUDIBLE],,

1190
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:34,390
we went around our town
towards that, uh, camp.

1191
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:38,381
And the next morning,
we came-- we came--

1192
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:40,210
we finally came to that camp.

1193
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,410
We joined a group
of Jewish workers,

1194
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:45,560
and we got into that camp.

1195
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,640
Our feet were swollen,
because we were always

1196
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,710
walking barefoot.

1197
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,970
SANDY HAYDEN: And hungry.

1198
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,890
RUBIN PINSKI: And hungry.

1199
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:57,310
But the conditions in that
camp was just terrible.

1200
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,780
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

1201
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,880
RUBIN PINSKI: It was summer.

1202
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,100
People slept under the sky.

1203
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,870
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

1204
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,970
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh,
there was very little food.

1205
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:13,210
And people had to carry stones
from one place to the other

1206
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,026
to--

1207
00:58:14,026 --> 00:58:18,775
to, uh, build that airport.

1208
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:25,829
And, uh, the, uh, we couldn't
work here, because we--

1209
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:26,620
our feet were all--

1210
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,578
SANDY HAYDEN: Was sore.

1211
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:29,620
RUBIN PINSKI: --were
beaten and swollen.

1212
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,075
So but they forced
us to go to work.

1213
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:36,280
SANDY HAYDEN: Who-- were these
not Germans again or Russians?

1214
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,100
Who?

1215
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,630
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
the, uh, the people

1216
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,950
who watched us were
actually Ukrainians.

1217
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,510
And there were Jewish police.

1218
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:52,660
The Germans always had this
streak to-- the-- to have

1219
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,410
their--

1220
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,545
their own-- their
own people to--

1221
00:58:56,545 --> 00:58:58,990
to do the bad job.

1222
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:04,160
So the Jewish police would
chase down the Jews to work.

1223
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,440
Actually, they had to.

1224
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,353
They had no choice.

1225
00:59:06,353 --> 00:59:07,103
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

1226
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:08,410
So you-- you--

1227
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:11,820
you are sympathetic to their
position, the Jewish police.

1228
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,376
You don't feel any--

1229
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:16,970
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they didn't
do anything that they could help

1230
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,470
it .

1231
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,520
A lot of them were
actually in the partisans,

1232
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,580
were running away to
the partisans together.

1233
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,056
But, uh, they had no choice.

1234
00:59:26,056 --> 00:59:28,730
They were appointed
by the Germans,

1235
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,220
and they to do what the
Germans told them to do.

1236
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:38,240
And, uh, finally by--

1237
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,520
by being there about
three weeks, we did--

1238
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,310
I, for example, had to--

1239
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:49,160
was chased out to go to work
on the carrying the stones.

1240
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,380
And I was looking for a way
to go back to the partisans

1241
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,440
till I--

1242
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,330
one day, I found--

1243
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:01,155
I noticed someone who I
knew went to the forest

1244
01:00:01,155 --> 01:00:06,260
yet before the slaughter
of the Jews in our town.

1245
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:11,870
And when I talked to
him, and we met up,

1246
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,840
they said that he
came to pick up Jews

1247
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:20,590
from this camp to the forest.

1248
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,995
And he gave me a
[INAUDIBLE],, a map how to--

1249
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,120
SANDY HAYDEN: To get there.

1250
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,630
RUBIN PINSKI: Go around.

1251
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:34,570
Not to go to villages or to, uh,
in other words, to be careful

1252
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:40,420
not to fall into certain,
uh, certain peasants who

1253
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,995
helped the Germans.

1254
01:00:42,995 --> 01:00:49,560
And, uh, and, uh,
one-- one evening,

1255
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,000
instead of going back to the--

1256
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,920
the ghetto, there
was also a ghetto

1257
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,246
in that camp, sort of a
ghetto, I stayed behind a--

1258
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:02,770
a hump of stones.

1259
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:07,940
And, uh, we left that camp.

1260
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,940
SANDY HAYDEN: You, and
your sister, and cousins.

1261
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,860
RUBIN PINSKI: My sister
and my two cousins.

1262
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,910
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

1263
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:17,270
RUBIN PINSKI: And
another two, six of us,

1264
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:21,390
and we made it during
the night to the forest.

1265
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,540
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

1266
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,650
Well, I think we finished
the first half of the tape.

1267
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,150
So--

1268
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,940
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

1269
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:27,910
SANDY HAYDEN: They are going
to rewind it and then--

1270
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:28,620
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

1271
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,517
SANDY HAYDEN: --we
can start from the--

1272
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:32,350
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, in
the [INAUDIBLE] forest.

1273
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,500
SANDY HAYDEN: In a
few minutes, yeah.

1274
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,268
