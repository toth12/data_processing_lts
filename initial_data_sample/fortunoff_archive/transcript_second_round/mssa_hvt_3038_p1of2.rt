how do you refer to it?<br>
<time begin="00:51.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, among<br>
friends and among, uh, people,<br>

RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I think--<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:02.114"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: A little<br>
easier for me to say<br>
<time begin="01:03.500"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Zhetel than Zdzieciol.<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:04.424"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

<time begin="01:50.395"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, not often.<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:51.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I was very young.<br>

<time begin="01:52.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>

<time begin="01:53.695"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I was just,<br>
uh, uh, school, uh, child.<br>
<time begin="01:57.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So I didn't have a chance<br>
to travel too much.<br>
<time begin="02:00.245"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.<br>

about, uh, 7,500 to 8,000.<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:10.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.<br>

RUBIN PINSKI: And at least<br>
60% of them are Jews.<br>
<time begin="02:15.195"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:16.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you-- you felt that<br>
it was more Jewish--<br>
<time begin="02:19.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you felt the Jewish community<br>
very strongly there.<br>
<time begin="02:22.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:22.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

And was your family attached<br>
to any organization?<br>
<time begin="02:59.216"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, my<br>
father was religious.<br>

<time begin="03:06.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
This is a religious<br>
organization.<br>
<time begin="03:10.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I-- I finished<br>
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..<br>
<time begin="03:14.882"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, also [? learning ?]<br>

SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:22.388"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, then I--<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:25.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
when I was 13, I was<br>
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..<br>
<time begin="03:30.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It was not far from<br>
our town, another town<br>
<time begin="03:33.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
called [INAUDIBLE].<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:35.198"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They had a [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]<br>
on the, uh,<br>
<time begin="03:40.092"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
it was called<br>
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] from<br>
<time begin="03:42.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:44.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I was there till--<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:46.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
till 1939.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:47.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:48.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you-- you had-- you had<br>
really a religious upbringing<br>
<time begin="03:51.785"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
then?<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:52.284"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Very<br>
religious, yes.<br>
<time begin="03:53.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and your<br>
early schooling was just<br>
<time begin="03:57.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
at in the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]<br>

<time begin="04:00.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

And-- and you learned<br>
all the subjects--<br>
<time begin="04:05.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
arithmetic and<br>
reading and writing.<br>
<time begin="04:07.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, this we<br>
learned because the school was<br>
<time begin="04:11.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
subsidized by the government.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:13.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And we had to do<br>
it to a half a day.<br>
<time begin="04:16.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And all these other--<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:18.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

<time begin="04:30.026"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the half-- other half<br>
of the day was religious.<br>
<time begin="04:32.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:32.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:33.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And did you, as a young<br>
boy, did you enjoy that?<br>
<time begin="04:36.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:36.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

<time begin="04:36.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, he did.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:37.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

thought, oh, I don't really<br>
<time begin="04:39.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like going.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:40.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Or it wasn't too-- it-- it<br>
wasn't-- you didn't see other<br>
<time begin="04:44.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Jewish boys who maybe had half<br>
the afternoon free because they<br>
<time begin="04:48.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
weren't going to town with<br>
[INAUDIBLE] something.<br>
<time begin="04:50.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, there was<br>
also a Yiddish [INAUDIBLE]..<br>
<time begin="04:54.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And [INAUDIBLE],, as I<br>
said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..<br>
<time begin="04:57.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Hebrew only.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:59.512"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, the youth<br>
used to get together,<br>
<time begin="05:02.075"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and we had<br>
discussions for hours,<br>
<time begin="05:04.456"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had the discussions,<br>
one with another.<br>
<time begin="05:06.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
[INAUDIBLE] religious<br>
youth and the--<br>
<time begin="05:09.417"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Zionists, yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:10.848"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The-- the<br>
other real nice gathering<br>
<time begin="05:15.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
[INAUDIBLE].<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:16.194"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And--<br>
and your father--<br>
<time begin="05:18.475"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
your father let you associate<br>
with all the other Jewish boys,<br>
<time begin="05:22.519"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
even if they weren't religious?<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:23.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:23.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: That wasn't--<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:25.075"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: It was, uh,<br>
a habit that Saturday.<br>
<time begin="05:28.115"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
My father used to<br>
take, uh, the, uh,<br>
<time begin="05:32.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
children and study<br>
with them [INAUDIBLE]<br>
<time begin="05:35.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
while other children were<br>
playing football or something<br>
<time begin="05:38.514"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like that.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:39.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But we had to obli--<br>
oblige to our parents and--<br>
<time begin="05:45.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and, uh, and do it for<br>
them because, uh, we<br>
<time begin="05:48.941"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
always suspected our parents.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:50.966"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.<br>

<time begin="06:31.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and, uh, other things and sell<br>
it in, uh, a bigger wholesale.<br>
<time begin="06:40.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>

SANDY HAYDEN: Good<br>
Jewish mother, yeah.<br>
<time begin="07:56.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And did you have<br>
quite a bit of family,<br>
<time begin="07:58.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
cousins, and aunts, and uncles?<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:00.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:01.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yes, we had.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:02.152"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um, not far from our house<br>
my-- my mother's sister<br>
<time begin="08:09.212"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and her family,<br>
they all perished.<br>
<time begin="08:13.848"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And my father's family<br>
was in another city.<br>
<time begin="08:17.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It's called [INAUDIBLE]<br>
oh, about 100 kilometers<br>
<time begin="08:22.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from us towards, uh, Pinsk.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:26.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And he had a brother, and<br>
sisters, and a mother.<br>
<time begin="08:31.869"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
As a matter of fact, it was only<br>
once in my life in that town<br>
<time begin="08:36.728"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
where my father comes from.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:37.853"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:38.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I was only<br>
eight, nine years old.<br>
<time begin="08:40.895"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So they did--<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:42.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I remember it<br>
very vaguely about that town.<br>
<time begin="08:45.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So you much--<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:46.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
really, you had<br>
much more contact<br>
<time begin="08:48.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
with your mother's<br>
side of the family.<br>
<time begin="08:50.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:51.096"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:52.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you used to spend all<br>
holidays and celebrations?<br>
<time begin="08:55.435"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we used<br>
to get together on holidays.<br>
<time begin="08:57.833"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:01.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And sometimes in the middle<br>
of the week, we used to--<br>
<time begin="09:04.204"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I used to play with my<br>
cousins like a normal--<br>
<time begin="09:10.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
normal way of--<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:12.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Of growing up.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:14.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: A fun<br>
way of growing up, yes.<br>
<time begin="09:16.801"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:18.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the other 40% of<br>
people who lived<br>
<time begin="09:21.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the town, who were they?<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:23.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Were they Poles?<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:25.050"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: A lot<br>
of them were farmers.<br>
<time begin="09:29.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And some were the, uh--<br>
the administration--<br>
<time begin="09:34.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the Polish administration<br>
like policeman--<br>
<time begin="09:37.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there was a magistrate.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:39.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It's like a city hall here.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:42.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the, uh, the<br>
mayor was a Pole.<br>
<time begin="09:47.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the secretaries were Poles.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:51.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, there was--<br>
there wasn't a very big<br>
<time begin="09:55.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
administration in our town.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:58.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But, uh, and-- and<br>
enough Poles to--<br>
<time begin="10:02.965"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to collect taxes and--<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:07.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and look after all the, uh--<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:10.832"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Administration.<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:12.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Administration<br>
of the city, yeah.<br>
<time begin="10:13.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So that's really<br>
all that they did there,<br>
<time begin="10:16.131"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the Jews were--<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:18.760"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the Jews were involved in all<br>
sorts of other professions<br>
<time begin="10:21.197"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
[INAUDIBLE].<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:21.696"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yeah, the Jews<br>
were all kinds of professions.<br>
<time begin="10:25.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Shoe-- shoemakers, fixing shoes,<br>
and tailors, a lot of tailors,<br>
<time begin="10:34.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and, uh, storekeepers, like<br>
groceries and selling fabric.<br>
<time begin="10:42.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That was also developed<br>
a lot in our town,<br>
<time begin="10:45.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
selling leather, leather<br>
soles and leather--<br>
<time begin="10:49.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the shoes were made by hand.<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:51.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:52.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Really?<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:53.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Everybody's shoes<br>
were made by hand.<br>
<time begin="10:55.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: But there<br>
was only one store--<br>
<time begin="10:57.962"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
while I was going up, I<br>
remember started butter shoes.<br>
<time begin="11:02.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And one store of<br>
butter shoes opened up,<br>
<time begin="11:08.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but until then,<br>
there was no stores,<br>
<time begin="11:11.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
no shoes where they made shoes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:13.586"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:14.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: All made by hand.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:16.728"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:18.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And-- and-- um, I<br>
suppose that there<br>
<time begin="11:21.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were no Jews who were farmers<br>
or landowners around the town.<br>
<time begin="11:25.762"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br>
there were a few<br>
<time begin="11:27.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
also had some farms,<br>
not big ones, small--<br>
<time begin="11:31.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
small farms.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:32.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So they were<br>
allowed to own the land, and--<br>
<time begin="11:34.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And they<br>
were doing the same<br>
<time begin="11:36.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
as other farmers,<br>
but not too many.<br>
<time begin="11:39.361"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:40.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: There were in<br>
the villages around the town,<br>
<time begin="11:44.142"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there were quite a few<br>
Jews in the farming,<br>
<time begin="11:49.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like in the other--<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:51.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
peasant, non-Jews,<br>
peasants, they also<br>
<time begin="11:54.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
owned a couple of hectares<br>
of land and lived from that.<br>
<time begin="12:00.484"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:01.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: But in<br>
the town, there was--<br>
<time begin="12:03.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:04.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Mostly the<br>
Jews were like professionals,<br>
<time begin="12:11.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like shoemakers, and tailors.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:14.879"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:15.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And a lot of<br>
Jews were just starting--<br>
<time begin="12:19.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
sitting and starting<br>
[INAUDIBLE]..<br>
<time begin="12:21.365"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:22.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And what does-- what<br>
were the relationships<br>
<time begin="12:25.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like between the Jews and<br>
the Poles in the town?<br>
<time begin="12:28.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: As a matter fact,<br>
the relationship was very good.<br>
<time begin="12:31.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah?<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:32.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Especially with<br>
the white Russians in our town.<br>
<time begin="12:36.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The white Russians<br>
were very nice to us.<br>
<time begin="12:40.370"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The Poles themselves<br>
were anti-Semitic.<br>
<time begin="12:42.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: They were?<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:43.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:44.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So you<br>
experienced that right from--<br>
<time begin="12:46.517"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:47.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: An early age.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:48.474"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Since Hitler<br>
came to power in 1933, the, uh,<br>
<time begin="12:53.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Poles became different.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:56.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were already anti-Semitic.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:57.617"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you--<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:58.575"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
can you remember in what<br>
way they became different?<br>
<time begin="13:01.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, in the<br>
last years in 1937, '38,<br>
<time begin="13:06.345"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I remember they used to come<br>
from bigger cities, young Poles<br>
<time begin="13:13.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and carrying placards<br>
saying, don't buy from Jews<br>
<time begin="13:19.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and, uh, buy from Poles only.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:22.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the anti-Semitism<br>
started already to grow.<br>
<time begin="13:25.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:27.365"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And do you remember-- do you<br>
remember talking about it<br>
<time begin="13:30.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
as a young boy or hearing<br>
your father and mother<br>
<time begin="13:33.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
talk about it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:34.474"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Were they worried<br>
about it at all?<br>
<time begin="13:35.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, we all--<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:37.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we knew already what<br>
actually from the papers,<br>
<time begin="13:41.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from the Jewish papers we<br>
used to guess from, uh,<br>
<time begin="13:44.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the [INAUDIBLE],, like it was,<br>
uh, produced in, uh, Warsaw.<br>
<time begin="13:50.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We used to get these papers.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:52.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And we heard what going<br>
on in German, what<br>
<time begin="13:54.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the Germans did to the Jews.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:57.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we were already scared.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:59.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:59.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You were worried that that could<br>
start happening in Poland also.<br>
<time begin="14:02.556"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we were<br>
very worried and scared<br>
<time begin="14:04.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the last few years<br>
before the war broke out.<br>
<time begin="14:08.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:09.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And even though the Jews were<br>
the majority in your town, you<br>
<time begin="14:13.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
still, the Poles were<br>
still openly anti-Semitic.<br>
<time begin="14:16.931"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They weren't scared of--<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:17.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:18.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: --of [INAUDIBLE].<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:19.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they were--<br>
they were very anti-Semitic<br>
<time begin="14:22.045"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
openly, but not actually not<br>
the local Poles, always--<br>
<time begin="14:25.887"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, always<br>
Poles that came by.<br>
<time begin="14:27.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Came by.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:28.636"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they also planted, uh,<br>
anti-Semitism into the Poles<br>
<time begin="14:33.600"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in our town.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:36.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But with the white<br>
Russians, neighbors,<br>
<time begin="14:39.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we lived in very peaceful.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:42.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they were very nice.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:46.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So when-- when<br>
did all of that start to change?<br>
<time begin="14:50.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The last couple<br>
of years, uh, before the war<br>
<time begin="14:53.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
started.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:54.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That-- wars, and<br>
wars, and wars always.<br>
<time begin="14:58.339"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And with--<br>
with the- white Russians<br>
<time begin="15:00.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the Poles in the town<br>
also or still just the people<br>
<time begin="15:03.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
who were passing through?<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:04.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The Poles.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:05.659"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And some-- not too<br>
many white Russians<br>
<time begin="15:08.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
became already a little bit<br>
also with a cold shoulder<br>
<time begin="15:13.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
toward the Jews.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:16.022"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were already, uh, showing<br>
anti-Semitic, uh, tendencies.<br>
<time begin="15:21.808"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:24.682"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And, um, can you--<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:26.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
can you describe what<br>
happened, um, in 1939 when--<br>
<time begin="15:30.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
when--<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:31.365"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, well,<br>
when the war broke out,<br>
<time begin="15:35.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
when the Germans attacked<br>
Poland, the Poles, a lot<br>
<time begin="15:42.600"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of Polish, uh, soldiers were<br>
running through our town<br>
<time begin="15:47.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
towards Russia.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:48.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were escaping<br>
from the Germans.<br>
<time begin="15:52.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, the war broke out on<br>
the 1st of September, 1939.<br>
<time begin="16:01.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I think it was the 17th of<br>
September the Russians came in<br>
<time begin="16:08.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from-- from Minsk,<br>
from the other side<br>
<time begin="16:11.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and occupied our town.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:14.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And we came under the Russian<br>
government and the Russian, uh,<br>
<time begin="16:21.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
occupation.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:22.734"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And<br>
did things start<br>
<time begin="16:24.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to change very<br>
much at that time?<br>
<time begin="16:25.752"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Changed--<br>
it changed very--<br>
<time begin="16:27.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
very rapidly, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:29.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: How old<br>
were you, um, when the--<br>
<time begin="16:32.614"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: In 1939?<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:33.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: 1939.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:34.321"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You mind me asking you?<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:35.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I<br>
was only 15 years old.<br>
<time begin="16:37.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: 15 years old.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:38.944"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:39.386"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:40.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you were a young-- you<br>
were a young boy then?<br>
<time begin="16:43.095"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Very young boy.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:44.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Do<br>
you remember-- do<br>
<time begin="16:45.603"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you remember some<br>
of the feelings<br>
<time begin="16:46.977"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that you had when-- when--<br>
when the Russians occupied<br>
<time begin="16:49.242"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
your town?<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:49.742"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, when the<br>
Russians came, I mean, we--<br>
<time begin="16:52.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we accepted them with open arms.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:54.805"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:55.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You mean rather than<br>
have the Germans--<br>
<time begin="16:57.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="16:58.355"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We knew what the<br>
Germans did to the Jews.<br>
<time begin="17:00.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they-- they were<br>
actually, uh, liberators.<br>
<time begin="17:04.589"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they behaved very<br>
nice except some of the--<br>
<time begin="17:09.566"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from the rich Jews<br>
took away the--<br>
<time begin="17:13.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
their stores.<br>
<br>
<time begin="17:14.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Anybody who had a fabric<br>
store, other kinds of stores,<br>
<time begin="17:19.339"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they confiscated it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="17:22.050"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But they let the<br>
people work for them,<br>
<time begin="17:25.655"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and they found<br>
jobs for everybody.<br>
<time begin="17:28.089"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And life went on fine.<br>
<br>
<time begin="17:32.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: But<br>
you were hearing--<br>
<time begin="17:33.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you were hearing reports of<br>
what was going on in Germany.<br>
<time begin="17:37.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Can you tell me what some of<br>
the things that you heard in--<br>
<time begin="17:40.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: They used to<br>
hear only from the paper<br>
<time begin="17:45.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
what the Germans behaved--<br>
<br>
<time begin="17:47.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
did bad to the Germans<br>
Jews, also to the, uh--<br>
<time begin="17:52.121"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
when we heard the trouble<br>
before the Russians came in.<br>
<time begin="17:58.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We knew what's going more<br>
or less on in the paper.<br>
<time begin="18:02.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But the Russians concealed<br>
from us everything.<br>
<time begin="18:04.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They didn't know what's going<br>
on in the other half of Poland.<br>
<time begin="18:09.175"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really,<br>
once they occupied--<br>
<time begin="18:10.925"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Once<br>
they occupied,<br>
<time begin="18:12.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we didn't know anything, just--<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:14.975"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they told us what they<br>
wanted to tell us.<br>
<time begin="18:17.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So did--<br>
did you feel at any time<br>
<time begin="18:20.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that you and your family<br>
would like to escape or to go<br>
<time begin="18:23.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to another part of Europe?<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:24.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Or did you feel<br>
that you would just<br>
<time begin="18:26.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
stay their for the meantime?<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:28.237"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Even if you felt--<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:29.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but we couldn't do anything--<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:31.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: You<br>
didn't have a chance.<br>
<time begin="18:32.635"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: --because<br>
the Russian policy was you,<br>
<time begin="18:36.295"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, if you are not with<br>
us, you are against us.<br>
<time begin="18:39.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In other words, if you<br>
want to go away, you are--<br>
<time begin="18:42.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you are our enemy.<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:44.613"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:45.363"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So that was dangerous<br>
for you too.<br>
<time begin="18:47.216"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: So<br>
we couldn't even<br>
<time begin="18:48.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
think of escaping or<br>
going anywhere then.<br>
<time begin="18:53.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We didn't have the<br>
money to go too.<br>
<time begin="18:56.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
There was no-- nowhere to go.<br>
<br>
<time begin="18:58.832"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: But<br>
when the Russians<br>
<time begin="19:00.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
came to occupy<br>
[INAUDIBLE],, you must<br>
<time begin="19:03.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
have been at you-- at yeshiva<br>
in the neighboring town?<br>
<time begin="19:06.562"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Or had you come back in town.<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:07.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I came back<br>
to our town, because the, uh,<br>
<time begin="19:11.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Russians, they didn't exactly--<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:15.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they didn't say you<br>
can do it, but so--<br>
<time begin="19:19.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
all the religious issues<br>
disappeared somehow.<br>
<time begin="19:24.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:25.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The,<br>
uh, officially,<br>
<time begin="19:28.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they didn't say you<br>
cannot go to synagogue,<br>
<time begin="19:31.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
because the Jews went<br>
to synagogue while, uh--<br>
<time begin="19:35.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
while they were in occupation.<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:38.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But somehow, the Jews<br>
alone were afraid to do it.<br>
<time begin="19:42.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:43.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So-- so yeshivas closed down?<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:46.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: There was no--<br>
no more yeshivas at all.<br>
<time begin="19:48.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And then we-- we um, had<br>
to go to Russian schools<br>
<time begin="19:53.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to learn Russian.<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:54.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="19:54.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So that's what you did<br>
when you went back home.<br>
<time begin="19:56.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That's<br>
what I did, yes.<br>
<time begin="19:57.280"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So you<br>
were at-- at a school<br>
<time begin="19:59.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
with Russians and Poles.<br>
<br>
<time begin="20:00.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it was now a<br>
mix-- a mixed school.<br>
<time begin="20:02.849"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Mixed, but<br>
we-- we taught the subjects<br>
<time begin="20:05.015"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that are only Russian.<br>
<br>
<time begin="20:06.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We started a new<br>
language altogether.<br>
<time begin="20:08.457"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And<br>
how was-- how was it<br>
<time begin="20:10.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
going to a school<br>
like that, because it<br>
<time begin="20:12.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
seems to be very different<br>
from what you were used to?<br>
<time begin="20:14.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, uh, but we--<br>
<br>
<time begin="20:17.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we could learn,<br>
because the language<br>
<time begin="20:19.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
itself was, uh, was a lot easier<br>
to catch, because the white--<br>
<time begin="20:26.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
white Russian is<br>
similar to Russian.<br>
<time begin="20:28.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Polish is also a bit<br>
similar in a way.<br>
<time begin="20:33.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the-- the writing<br>
and reading was harder,<br>
<time begin="20:38.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but the speaking, we<br>
caught on very fast.<br>
<time begin="20:41.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="20:42.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And how was it to be<br>
in the class with, um,<br>
<time begin="20:44.864"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
with other children, with the<br>
Russian and Polish children?<br>
<time begin="20:47.632"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Did you get on with them,<br>
or was there anti-Semitism?<br>
<time begin="20:49.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="20:50.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No, no, there was<br>
no anti-Semitism,<br>
<time begin="20:52.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
because, uh, they--<br>
they knew that uh,<br>
<time begin="20:58.105"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the Russians in the<br>
Russian government,<br>
<time begin="21:03.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there was no<br>
anti-Semitism at all.<br>
<time begin="21:04.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Everybody is the same.<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:07.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And actually, they used to, uh,<br>
punish for anti-Semitic, uh,<br>
<time begin="21:14.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the writing--<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:15.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
saying.<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:16.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They, uh, used to--<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:18.642"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
people are afraid<br>
to be anti-Semitic.<br>
<time begin="21:20.295"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:21.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the Poles also then<br>
were afraid in school<br>
<time begin="21:23.359"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to be anti-Semitic.<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:24.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,<br>
actually, the Poles,<br>
<time begin="21:26.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the few Poles that<br>
were in our town<br>
<time begin="21:28.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
disappeared, the ones that were<br>
in the administration before.<br>
<time begin="21:34.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the-- the Polish<br>
farmers behaved like, uh,<br>
<time begin="21:40.615"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like they have to behave<br>
under the Russian occupation.<br>
<time begin="21:44.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:45.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So how many years was--<br>
were you under occupation<br>
<time begin="21:48.485"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
by the Russian forces?<br>
<br>
<time begin="21:50.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, from<br>
1939, from September 1939<br>
<time begin="21:54.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
till the outbreak of the<br>
war at the 22nd of June,<br>
<time begin="21:59.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
1941 when Hitler<br>
attacked Russia.<br>
<time begin="22:03.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:04.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So that was two years.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:06.729"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Nearly two years.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:08.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Right,<br>
nearly two years, yeah.<br>
<time begin="22:09.046"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Two years, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:09.760"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And in a way, it<br>
sounds like your life didn't<br>
<time begin="22:12.218"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
change too much in those tears.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:13.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The everyday living<br>
didn't change too much.<br>
<time begin="22:17.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, it<br>
did change in, uh, in uh,<br>
<time begin="22:20.925"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the way that, from one<br>
government to the other,<br>
<time begin="22:24.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
which, uh, the Russians had<br>
started to, uh, put in us--<br>
<time begin="22:31.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
teach-- teach us-- teach us<br>
their ways that you cannot be<br>
<time begin="22:35.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the, uh, dealings or any,<br>
uh, you cannot own a store.<br>
<time begin="22:41.325"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You can-- you can't,<br>
uh, be for your own.<br>
<time begin="22:44.294"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Everything has to be<br>
for the government.<br>
<time begin="22:45.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:46.600"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Now what you have<br>
to work for the government.<br>
<time begin="22:48.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:49.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So it was more<br>
Marxist or socialist.<br>
<time begin="22:52.370"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:53.315"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They tried to teach us.<br>
<br>
<time begin="22:55.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But it wasn't so easy to<br>
absorb in the beginning.<br>
<time begin="22:58.886"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, so that<br>
was a bit difficult for--<br>
<time begin="23:01.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
for all of you.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:02.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right,<br>
but it was at least safe.<br>
<time begin="23:05.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:05.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And was your father<br>
able to continue<br>
<time begin="23:07.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
doing what he had been doing?<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:08.872"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:09.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: What-- what--<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:10.705"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
what did he-- what<br>
happened to his work then?<br>
<time begin="23:13.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: He, uh, he<br>
used to buy, well, not<br>
<time begin="23:17.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
exactly the same way as to--<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:20.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
before used to buy direct<br>
from the farmers and--<br>
<time begin="23:23.830"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and sell it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:24.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And here he had to work<br>
for the government.<br>
<time begin="23:28.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He used to buy also<br>
from the farmers,<br>
<time begin="23:31.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but, uh, like in a<br>
cooperative sort of.<br>
<time begin="23:34.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He used to write down<br>
everything he buys<br>
<time begin="23:38.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and, uh, pay out the farmers.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:42.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He worked for the<br>
government, in other words.<br>
<time begin="23:44.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And<br>
how-- how was that?<br>
<time begin="23:45.661"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Was that a big change for him?<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:47.327"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: He got<br>
used to it first.<br>
<time begin="23:48.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:50.413"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But it was-- it was all right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:51.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Before<br>
that change, yeah.<br>
<time begin="23:53.464"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But we got used to it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:54.381"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="23:55.255"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Did that mean that,<br>
materially, that you<br>
<time begin="23:57.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had less in your family<br>
than you were used to?<br>
<time begin="24:00.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br>
uh, a little bit less,<br>
<time begin="24:03.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but it wasn't too bad.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:04.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It was enough to get by.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:07.062"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:07.826"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So food, and<br>
clothing, and shoes,<br>
<time begin="24:10.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and all that sort of thing<br>
during the Russian occupation<br>
<time begin="24:13.050"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
wasn't-- was that-- was<br>
not too much of a problem.<br>
<time begin="24:15.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You never--<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:16.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, it was<br>
a problem, because it never<br>
<time begin="24:20.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
brought in anything.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:22.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They took away.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:22.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:23.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Anything<br>
that was produced,<br>
<time begin="24:26.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they took away from our<br>
town and sent into Russia.<br>
<time begin="24:29.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But, uh, we never<br>
brought anything.<br>
<time begin="24:32.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
If they did bring<br>
something, you had<br>
<time begin="24:35.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to stand in, uh, a queue<br>
for-- for hours to get it.<br>
<time begin="24:41.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But we didn't complain.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:42.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It was-- they let us live.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:45.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That was-- that was<br>
the main good thing<br>
<time begin="24:48.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
about the Russian occupation.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:49.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:50.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you were just hoping that<br>
that would continue right<br>
<time begin="24:54.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
until--<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:54.727"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:55.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: But then in 1941--<br>
<br>
<time begin="24:58.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941, when Hitler<br>
attacked, uh, Russia, our city<br>
<time begin="25:05.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was taken by the<br>
Germans officially<br>
<time begin="25:08.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
until the 8th of June, 1941.<br>
<br>
<time begin="25:12.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="25:12.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That<br>
was eight days later.<br>
<time begin="25:16.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And in the eight<br>
days, the, uh, there<br>
<time begin="25:20.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were some battles close to our<br>
town with the, uh, the, uh,<br>
<time begin="25:28.265"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Russians who were running<br>
away with the Germans who<br>
<time begin="25:31.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were coming as parachutists.<br>
<br>
<time begin="25:38.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The-- actually<br>
they didn't take--<br>
<time begin="25:40.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the Germans didn't occupy<br>
our town as a full army.<br>
<time begin="25:45.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But, uh, the, uh, they<br>
parachuted behind the town<br>
<time begin="25:51.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and attacked all the, uh,<br>
running away trucks and, uh,<br>
<time begin="25:56.830"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and tanks from the Russian.<br>
<br>
<time begin="25:58.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="25:59.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So there was--<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:00.389"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Eight days.<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:01.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, so there<br>
was fighting around your town<br>
<time begin="26:03.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
for-- for eight days.<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:04.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah, so<br>
fighting about eight days.<br>
<time begin="26:06.806"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:07.681"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And what was it like<br>
during those eight days.<br>
<time begin="26:09.885"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,<br>
it was very bad.<br>
<time begin="26:11.664"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The, uh, the Jews,<br>
uh, not only do<br>
<time begin="26:14.738"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the whole population couldn't<br>
get out of the houses, hiding<br>
<time begin="26:17.196"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the houses.<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:18.873"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they did get out<br>
the, uh, the planes<br>
<time begin="26:24.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
shooting over the head,<br>
the German planes.<br>
<time begin="26:28.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In other words, uh,<br>
most people were hiding.<br>
<time begin="26:31.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:32.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And you must-- do you rem--<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:34.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I mean, you must have been<br>
very frightened about it.<br>
<time begin="26:36.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Very<br>
frightened, yes.<br>
<time begin="26:37.362"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you<br>
remember the feeling?<br>
<time begin="26:39.112"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br>
yes, I remember.<br>
<time begin="26:40.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I used to hide even<br>
in the basement.<br>
<time begin="26:43.149"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: With<br>
your whole family?<br>
<time begin="26:44.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The whole family<br>
for days till-- till the, uh,<br>
<time begin="26:50.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
shooting got a little<br>
bit, uh, eased.<br>
<time begin="26:54.296"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="26:55.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And during those<br>
eight days, do you--<br>
<time begin="26:57.462"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I mean, were you<br>
worried about what<br>
<time begin="26:58.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was going to happen now<br>
that the Russians had left?<br>
<time begin="27:01.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,<br>
the uh, we knew<br>
<time begin="27:03.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that it's not so good that<br>
the Germans occupied the, uh,<br>
<time begin="27:11.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
living will be, uh,<br>
bad [INAUDIBLE]..<br>
<time begin="27:15.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We knew what to expect.<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:16.745"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: You did know?<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:17.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:18.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Was this--<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:19.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
how hard-- how-- how did<br>
you know this information,<br>
<time begin="27:22.280"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
because you--<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:23.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,<br>
we knew what they do--<br>
<time begin="27:25.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they did in Germany<br>
or in Poland.<br>
<time begin="27:27.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we knew what to expect.<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:31.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And so it happened.<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:32.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:33.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Can you-- can you<br>
tell us what happened<br>
<time begin="27:34.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from the time the<br>
Germans occupied?<br>
<time begin="27:35.124"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="27:36.456"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The German soldiers,<br>
they came in the town.<br>
<time begin="27:40.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They-- they were very careful<br>
walking by houses singularly.<br>
<time begin="27:46.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They, uh, first<br>
came in without--<br>
<time begin="27:50.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
without, uh, cars, or tanks,<br>
or just occupied the city.<br>
<time begin="27:56.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, immediately,<br>
they started,<br>
<time begin="28:00.595"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
um, they started to<br>
ask the, uh, some<br>
<time begin="28:07.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of the, uh, Polish or white--<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:11.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
or the-- or the<br>
non-Jewish population<br>
<time begin="28:14.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
where are-- where the Jews are.<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:17.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they asked for food from<br>
the Jews and asked for bicycles.<br>
<time begin="28:22.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And you<br>
gave it all to them?<br>
<time begin="28:24.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Everything.<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:24.305"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: They had to, yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:25.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: They<br>
had no choice.<br>
<time begin="28:26.575"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:27.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And they had--<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:29.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
right away, the Germans<br>
had some of the, uh,<br>
<time begin="28:34.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of the town's inhabitants.<br>
<br>
<time begin="28:37.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Some of them where they<br>
with them, helping them,<br>
<time begin="28:42.886"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, showing them the<br>
Jewish, uh, houses.<br>
<time begin="28:47.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they went and robbed,<br>
and beat, and uh, and--<br>
<time begin="28:53.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the three days<br>
after the, uh, they<br>
<time begin="28:59.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had already with them<br>
some, um, placards<br>
<time begin="29:04.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
hanging out in, uh, three<br>
languages-- in German,<br>
<time begin="29:08.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in Russian, and,<br>
uh, and uh, Polish.<br>
<time begin="29:13.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
All de-- decrees against Jews.<br>
<br>
<time begin="29:16.878"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?<br>
<br>
<time begin="29:17.753"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="29:18.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That the Jews,<br>
uh, cannot walk on the sidewalk.<br>
<time begin="29:23.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They cannot, uh,<br>
possess, uh, fur coats.<br>
<time begin="29:28.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He cannot-- they<br>
cannot have any gold.<br>
<time begin="29:33.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They have to give it<br>
away to the Germans--<br>
<time begin="29:36.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and a long list of<br>
decrees against Jews.<br>
<time begin="29:41.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we knew right away<br>
the trouble started.<br>
<time begin="29:44.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="29:47.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, slowly, the Jews<br>
started to come out of the--<br>
<time begin="29:54.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of the hiding.<br>
<br>
<time begin="29:55.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And-- and, uh, the, uh, Germans<br>
gave every day new orders<br>
<time begin="30:06.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to, uh, collect food and<br>
collect clothes for them.<br>
<time begin="30:11.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And then in the, uh, third<br>
week was in July the 5th.<br>
<time begin="30:18.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: At that<br>
time, had they, um,<br>
<time begin="30:19.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had there been any brutality?<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:22.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Had there been-- had<br>
they killed any Jews<br>
<time begin="30:24.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
during those three weeks?<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:25.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Or had they just beaten them up?<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:27.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: They killed--<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:29.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they made like, um,<br>
6 o'clock was curfew.<br>
<time begin="30:34.500"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:35.412"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And nobody<br>
could go-- get out<br>
<time begin="30:37.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of the house at 6<br>
o'clock in the evening.<br>
<time begin="30:41.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It wasn't evening yet.<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:43.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So in several cases, some<br>
Jews walked to one house<br>
<time begin="30:50.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to the other.<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:51.156"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?<br>
<br>
<time begin="30:52.031"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: After six of<br>
them got shot right way.<br>
<time begin="30:54.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In other words,<br>
non-Jews weren't shot.<br>
<time begin="30:57.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But Jews are shot<br>
for-- for that.<br>
<time begin="30:59.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That was the-- several<br>
Jews were shot that way.<br>
<time begin="31:05.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But then on the 15th of<br>
July, the, uh, the uh,<br>
<time begin="31:11.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
order to make Judenrat.<br>
<br>
<time begin="31:13.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In other words, they picked<br>
10 of the best Jews from town<br>
<time begin="31:18.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and--<br>
<br>
<time begin="31:20.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and ordered them<br>
to have a Judenrat<br>
<time begin="31:22.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and have a Jewish police.<br>
<br>
<time begin="31:26.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, then the, uh,<br>
the next day, the--<br>
<time begin="31:32.402"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you know--<br>
you knew some of the people who<br>
<time begin="31:34.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were elected to the Judenrat?<br>
<br>
<time begin="31:37.225"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="31:38.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Actually, the best, uh, the<br>
best, uh, people from the city.<br>
<time begin="31:44.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
One was a lawyer called Alter<br>
Dvoretsky was a young man.<br>
<time begin="31:49.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He was very capable.<br>
<br>
<time begin="31:50.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He was at the head<br>
of the Judenrat<br>
<time begin="31:53.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and, uh, several of<br>
religious Jews [INAUDIBLE]..<br>
<time begin="31:59.987"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So they--<br>
they were all good people.<br>
<time begin="32:02.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: All-- a<br>
better class of people.<br>
<time begin="32:06.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
As a matter of fact,<br>
the rabbi for our town<br>
<time begin="32:08.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was also included in that.<br>
<br>
<time begin="32:11.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the men on the<br>
15h of July, it<br>
<time begin="32:16.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was only two weeks<br>
after they occup--<br>
<time begin="32:19.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they came in, they,<br>
uh, sent the police<br>
<time begin="32:23.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to tell all the Jews to<br>
come on the marketplace,<br>
<time begin="32:29.370"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to get on the market place<br>
from the age of 16 to 60.<br>
<time begin="32:37.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Actually, they said<br>
officially 16 to 60,<br>
<time begin="32:41.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but whenever they<br>
caught younger ones,<br>
<time begin="32:44.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they also pushed<br>
to the marketplace.<br>
<time begin="32:47.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, on that--<br>
<br>
<time begin="32:50.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
on that, uh, marketplace,<br>
the Gestapo came in.<br>
<time begin="32:56.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They had a-- a table<br>
and the market chairs.<br>
<time begin="32:59.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they had a<br>
big list of people<br>
<time begin="33:03.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
who they called and said,<br>
anybody will be called out<br>
<time begin="33:06.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
should go forward.<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:07.852"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:09.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And that way,<br>
they took away 120 people.<br>
<time begin="33:13.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:13.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
What sort of people were they?<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:15.306"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
All men or--<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:16.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: All men and<br>
the better-- the better<br>
<time begin="33:20.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
class of people from the<br>
city, and the-- and the<br>
<time begin="33:23.122"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, the richer and, uh, more<br>
learned, and they packed them<br>
<time begin="33:32.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in talks.<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:34.415"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: How<br>
do you-- how do<br>
<time begin="33:35.790"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you think they got that list?<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:36.998"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Who gave them the list?<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:37.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The, uh, the<br>
list was helped by the, uh,<br>
<time begin="33:42.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
local, by local<br>
collaborators to the Germans.<br>
<time begin="33:46.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="33:47.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Who knew the people in<br>
the-- the Jewish people.<br>
<time begin="33:49.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: They<br>
knew everybody.<br>
<time begin="33:52.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
As a matter of fact,<br>
in [INAUDIBLE],,<br>
<time begin="33:55.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the Hebrew school,<br>
there was a janitor,<br>
<time begin="33:59.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and he could speak Yiddish<br>
just as good as any Jew.<br>
<time begin="34:03.673"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="34:04.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And he was<br>
right away with the Germans<br>
<time begin="34:07.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and gave out all the Jews<br>
who were, uh, known in the--<br>
<time begin="34:15.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the town .<br>
<br>
<time begin="34:15.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="34:18.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, they took--<br>
they said they<br>
<time begin="34:21.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
are going to take this, uh, 120<br>
people to work in Nowogrodek.<br>
<time begin="34:28.500"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Nowogrodek is a bigger city than<br>
us about 38 kilometers away.<br>
<time begin="34:35.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But we found out later that they<br>
were shot in the Nowogrodek.<br>
<time begin="34:40.484"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And when<br>
did you find that out?<br>
<time begin="34:43.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,<br>
we found out from--<br>
<time begin="34:46.279"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from peasants, which saw it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="34:50.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So that was<br>
the first really bad atrocity<br>
<time begin="34:53.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that--<br>
<br>
<time begin="34:54.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="34:55.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That was only two weeks<br>
after they entered our town.<br>
<time begin="35:00.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, the kids saw all<br>
kinds of, uh, every day they<br>
<time begin="35:07.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
demanded from us something<br>
else, the Germans.<br>
<time begin="35:12.280"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The, uh, or-- we organized<br>
work like there was, uh,<br>
<time begin="35:21.204"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
a highway the Russians<br>
started and didn't finish.<br>
<time begin="35:25.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So they, uh, took<br>
men who could-- well,<br>
<time begin="35:31.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they were a little stronger<br>
to work on that highway.<br>
<time begin="35:34.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I was also, uh,<br>
working on that highway.<br>
<time begin="35:38.731"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Because<br>
then you were a young man.<br>
<time begin="35:40.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You were 16, 17.<br>
<br>
<time begin="35:41.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I was<br>
young and strong, and--<br>
<time begin="35:42.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="35:43.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And<br>
I wanted to leave,<br>
<time begin="35:44.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and they gave out<br>
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..<br>
<time begin="35:46.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
[SPEAKING GERMAN] means<br>
some kind of a document.<br>
<time begin="35:49.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
There was-- it went<br>
by the column more<br>
<time begin="35:55.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the people who were<br>
stronger hard workers had<br>
<time begin="35:59.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
a red [SPEAKING GERMAN].<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:00.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Some had green<br>
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..<br>
<time begin="36:04.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, the people--<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:06.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the Jews were very,<br>
uh, wanted very<br>
<time begin="36:10.050"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
much to get [SPEAKING GERMAN].<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:12.074"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So--<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:12.573"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:13.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you had-- you had a red one?<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:15.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I have a good<br>
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, yes.<br>
<time begin="36:16.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: You<br>
had a good one.<br>
<time begin="36:17.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:18.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: How were you<br>
chosen to-- to go and work?<br>
<time begin="36:21.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I,<br>
uh, actually, they<br>
<time begin="36:24.807"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were asking for volunteers,<br>
and, uh, I wanted for this job,<br>
<time begin="36:32.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
so I worked on the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:34.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
on the, uh, building<br>
that highway.<br>
<time begin="36:36.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:36.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And your brothers?<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:38.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: My<br>
brother wasn't with me.<br>
<time begin="36:40.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He was, uh-- he<br>
was already taken--<br>
<time begin="36:43.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
before the at-- the<br>
Germans attacked,<br>
<time begin="36:48.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
he was taken to<br>
the Russian Army.<br>
<time begin="36:50.005"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: How--<br>
who-- who took him?<br>
<time begin="36:51.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Was he conscripted<br>
to the Russian Army?<br>
<time begin="36:54.136"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No, no.<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:55.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He was already of age.<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:56.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh, oh, I see.<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:57.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: He<br>
was born in 19--<br>
<time begin="36:58.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So he was in--<br>
<br>
<time begin="36:59.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: 20.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:00.148"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He was 18 years old,<br>
and he was taken legally<br>
<time begin="37:04.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to the Russian Army.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:05.382"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: To<br>
the Russian Army.<br>
<time begin="37:05.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:06.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So had you-- did you keep--<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:09.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
manage to keep correspondence<br>
with him during that time?<br>
<time begin="37:11.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: It wasn't very--<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:13.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
it was right before the war.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:15.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
All we heard-- we had only one<br>
letter from him that is going<br>
<time begin="37:19.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
into--<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:20.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
deep into Russia.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:22.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And then we were<br>
apart for six years.<br>
<time begin="37:26.065"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:26.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you didn't know what<br>
had happened to you.<br>
<time begin="37:28.773"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: We<br>
found him in 1946.<br>
<time begin="37:30.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:32.902"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So that was-- that must have<br>
been very hard for your mother<br>
<time begin="37:35.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and father.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:36.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:36.952"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: It<br>
would be really--<br>
<time begin="37:37.418"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:38.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And your sister?<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:39.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And--<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:40.179"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: The sister was<br>
the whole time with me together.<br>
<time begin="37:43.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:45.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And then your younger brother.<br>
<br>
<time begin="37:46.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No,<br>
my younger sister.<br>
<time begin="37:47.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Your<br>
younger sister, sorry.<br>
<time begin="37:49.558"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I didn't<br>
tell [INAUDIBLE]..<br>
<time begin="37:51.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
She perished in, uh, in 1942<br>
in August together the parents.<br>
<time begin="37:59.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So your father--<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:00.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
when the Germans<br>
came, your father<br>
<time begin="38:02.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
stopped, um, working, and--<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:06.257"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:07.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: You were the<br>
only one that was really,<br>
<time begin="38:09.485"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
um, working on the highway.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:12.447"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I was<br>
the only one, yes.<br>
<time begin="38:14.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So-- what-- what--<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:15.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
what were you getting<br>
paid in any way?<br>
<time begin="38:17.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:17.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:17.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Did they feed you?<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:18.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they<br>
didn't pay us anything.<br>
<time begin="38:20.296"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:21.298"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Uh, the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:24.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the, uh, in 1941 on<br>
November, the Germans<br>
<time begin="38:33.830"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
told us to leave our houses<br>
and go into a ghetto.<br>
<time begin="38:38.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They made a ghetto.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:40.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The Jews themselves had to<br>
make a fence, a wired fence,<br>
<time begin="38:44.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
around it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:46.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And at that time, uh, we<br>
could only take with us<br>
<time begin="38:51.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
whatever we could--<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:52.937"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Carry.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:53.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Carry.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:54.603"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="38:55.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And<br>
it happened that we<br>
<time begin="38:58.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had a big-- a very<br>
big garden and used<br>
<time begin="39:02.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to have enough<br>
potatoes to put it<br>
<time begin="39:07.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in a big hole covered<br>
with earth and hide it<br>
<time begin="39:12.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
for the next spring.<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:14.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That was done actually<br>
normal times too.<br>
<time begin="39:17.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:18.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:20.600"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
all the potato that we got from,<br>
uh, before the winter came,<br>
<time begin="39:28.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we bur--<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:30.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we buried it in the garden.<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:33.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, um, so in Spring<br>
of 1942 in the ghetto,<br>
<time begin="39:42.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I had that chance I--<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:44.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to open that hole and--<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:45.783"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:46.532"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: --put in the<br>
potatoes in the ghetto so we<br>
<time begin="39:49.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
could have--<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:50.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Some food?<br>
<br>
<time begin="39:51.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Some<br>
food for a while.<br>
<time begin="39:54.050"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The whole-- the whole, uh, all<br>
the inhabitants of that house,<br>
<time begin="39:59.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we shared.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:00.842"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We used to bring in<br>
like, uh, hiding it in--<br>
<time begin="40:08.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in a way that the Germans<br>
shouldn't see that they<br>
<time begin="40:11.280"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
carried potatoes in this--<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:12.401"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: How did<br>
you-- how did you do that?<br>
<time begin="40:14.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, we<br>
into the night, at night,<br>
<time begin="40:17.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and brought it in.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:19.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The houses that the<br>
Germans confiscated was--<br>
<time begin="40:22.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the front of the house<br>
was some sort of, uh--<br>
<time begin="40:27.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, a list that,<br>
uh, but this house<br>
<time begin="40:33.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
is confiscated by the Germans.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:34.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In the front, they couldn't<br>
get in, but from the back--<br>
<time begin="40:36.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: You could?<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:37.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI:<br>
--you could get in.<br>
<time begin="40:39.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But it didn't do anything.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:40.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
A lot of Jewish houses<br>
were occupied by--<br>
<time begin="40:44.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
by, uh, local, uh, non-Jews.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:48.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But some of them are still--<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:49.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
our house was still<br>
empty standing there.<br>
<time begin="40:51.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:52.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you could sneak in at night.<br>
<br>
<time begin="40:53.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I used<br>
to sneak in every night<br>
<time begin="40:56.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and bring a little<br>
bit of potatoes<br>
<time begin="40:58.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that I could carry myself.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:00.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:00.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And that's--<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:02.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that's how we could<br>
live for a while.<br>
<time begin="41:04.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm And what<br>
were the living conditions<br>
<time begin="41:07.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
like in the ghetto?<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:07.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Very bad.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:09.095"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:09.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Can you-- can you<br>
describe it a little bit?<br>
<time begin="41:11.201"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they<br>
packed in in the house,<br>
<time begin="41:15.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in a little house, about 800<br>
square feet or 900 square feet.<br>
<time begin="41:20.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They packed in about 60 people,<br>
one on top of the other.<br>
<time begin="41:26.067"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And that's how<br>
you and your family lived--<br>
<time begin="41:28.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
lived with another--<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:28.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:30.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: --50 people or so.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:31.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: In the<br>
basement and on top on the--<br>
<time begin="41:35.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
under the roof, people,<br>
one on top of the other,<br>
<time begin="41:40.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the conditions in the<br>
ghetto was very bad, dirty,<br>
<time begin="41:44.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and no food.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:46.252"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:47.002"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And-- and lice also.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:49.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:51.421"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And what--<br>
what did the people,<br>
<time begin="41:53.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the leaders of the<br>
ghetto, of the Judenrat,<br>
<time begin="41:55.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were they fair in the way they--<br>
<br>
<time begin="41:57.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they were<br>
very fair, but they were also--<br>
<time begin="42:00.495"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they had the same,<br>
uh, goals we did.<br>
<time begin="42:05.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were also afraid<br>
of-- the Germans used them<br>
<time begin="42:08.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
just to get their way.<br>
<br>
<time begin="42:11.370"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="42:12.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, this<br>
out-- this Alter Dvoretsky<br>
<time begin="42:17.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
is from the Judenrat.<br>
<br>
<time begin="42:20.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He organized a partisan<br>
group in the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="42:25.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And anybody who<br>
could be of help--<br>
<time begin="42:29.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
used everybody that<br>
could be of help.<br>
<time begin="42:31.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Only the young<br>
people he mobilized.<br>
<time begin="42:35.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And myself was working in the<br>
highway, building the highway.<br>
<time begin="42:40.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I had a chance to bring into<br>
the ghetto parts, uh, weapons.<br>
<time begin="42:46.056"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="42:47.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: So we used to<br>
tie it in bundles of wood.<br>
<time begin="42:53.402"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So<br>
they wouldn't see.<br>
<time begin="42:54.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: To carry it in.<br>
<br>
<time begin="42:58.242"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, I used to take<br>
chances to bring in parts<br>
<time begin="43:01.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of rifles and ammunition.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:06.484"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And from time to time,<br>
the Germans used to check<br>
<time begin="43:11.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
everybody-- every bundle of--<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:12.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Wood?<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:13.171"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Of wood,<br>
or on the person.<br>
<time begin="43:16.265"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Anybody that was found with<br>
something was shot right away.<br>
<time begin="43:19.359"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So you<br>
were lucky you never--<br>
<time begin="43:21.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I was lucky.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:21.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE].<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:22.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It must have been<br>
frightening each time.<br>
<time begin="43:24.276"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, I mean--<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:25.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, it's a risk.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:26.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I risked<br>
with my life all the time.<br>
<time begin="43:28.686"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:29.892"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you joined the partisan<br>
group in the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="43:31.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:33.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
[INAUDIBLE]<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:33.869"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: 194--<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:34.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
1941?<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:35.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:36.714"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:37.588"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: We organized the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:40.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the basement, we used<br>
to put together the rifles.<br>
<time begin="43:44.975"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:46.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
did you use them?<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:47.296"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
What-- what-- what--<br>
<br>
<time begin="43:48.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I didn't<br>
have a chance to use,<br>
<time begin="43:50.936"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and practically, nobody<br>
had a chance, only--<br>
<time begin="43:54.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
only a few young<br>
boys, uh, were, uh,<br>
<time begin="44:00.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
fighting against<br>
them in the second--<br>
<time begin="44:03.449"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
not in the second time when<br>
the Germans killed the Jews.<br>
<time begin="44:07.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The Germans killed,<br>
uh, about half<br>
<time begin="44:12.346"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of the Jewish population<br>
in the ghettos<br>
<time begin="44:13.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they killed in 1941<br>
till the end of April.<br>
<time begin="44:18.600"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN:<br>
Yeah, I-- can you--<br>
<time begin="44:20.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="44:20.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you tell<br>
me a little bit about--<br>
<time begin="44:21.685"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: That<br>
was a very bad day.<br>
<time begin="44:23.268"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Then my parents were--<br>
<br>
<time begin="44:26.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
got killed killed and my sister.<br>
<br>
<time begin="44:29.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Uh, it was the 30th of<br>
April, 1941, and the Germans,<br>
<time begin="44:36.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
with the help [INAUDIBLE]<br>
of the Ukrainian police,<br>
<time begin="44:41.786"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
so there were a few white<br>
Russian police also surrounded<br>
<time begin="44:49.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the ghetto.<br>
<br>
<time begin="44:50.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, very early in the<br>
morning, about 5 o'clock<br>
<time begin="44:54.504"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the morning, they started<br>
to knock on the windows<br>
<time begin="44:56.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and scream [SPEAKING GERMAN].<br>
<br>
<time begin="45:01.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, they told<br>
us to gather in<br>
<time begin="45:04.655"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that, uh, it was an old cem--<br>
<br>
<time begin="45:08.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Jewish cemetery<br>
near the, uh, the<br>
<time begin="45:11.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
synagogues and told<br>
us to gather there,<br>
<time begin="45:15.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
all the Jews should together.<br>
<br>
<time begin="45:17.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I came there.<br>
<br>
<time begin="45:20.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We, uh-- they told us to<br>
stand in families, each family<br>
<time begin="45:27.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
together, all the families.<br>
<br>
<time begin="45:29.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So I had that red<br>
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,<br>
<time begin="45:32.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
which was considered<br>
to be a good sign.<br>
<time begin="45:36.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I had a friend who also<br>
had a good [SPEAKING GERMAN],,<br>
<time begin="45:41.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
so I told him to take<br>
my sister, saying<br>
<time begin="45:46.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that this wife and I wanted<br>
to rescue my family, my father<br>
<time begin="45:49.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and mother.<br>
<br>
<time begin="45:53.055"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I remember they started to<br>
select the, uh, I showed him<br>
<time begin="46:00.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the [SPEAKING GERMAN].<br>
<br>
<time begin="46:01.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So he said, [SPEAKING GERMAN],,<br>
to the right, which was good.<br>
<time begin="46:07.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And right after, a couple<br>
steps from this Gestapo man,<br>
<time begin="46:14.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
stood other Gestapo<br>
people, looked<br>
<time begin="46:18.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
at the [SPEAKING GERMAN],,<br>
and they let me go through<br>
<time begin="46:22.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and apparently chased<br>
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,<br>
<time begin="46:26.225"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in other words--<br>
<br>
<time begin="46:27.830"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: To--<br>
to the bad line.<br>
<time begin="46:29.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: To--<br>
to get killed.<br>
<time begin="46:31.705"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They said to resettle for<br>
labor or something else,<br>
<time begin="46:37.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but they took them<br>
behind the town.<br>
<time begin="46:39.761"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And there was<br>
nothing that you could do.<br>
<time begin="46:42.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI:<br>
Nothing I could do.<br>
<time begin="46:43.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And my sister went<br>
with that, uh,<br>
<time begin="46:47.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
my friend who had a good<br>
[SPEAKING GERMAN] too,<br>
<time begin="46:50.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and she was, uh, rescued.<br>
<br>
<time begin="46:54.902"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Is that--<br>
<br>
<time begin="46:55.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that day must be a very hard<br>
day for you to remember.<br>
<time begin="46:58.068"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: A<br>
very bad day, yeah.<br>
<time begin="47:00.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They killed half of the<br>
Jewish population in one day,<br>
<time begin="47:05.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and then they<br>
shortened the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="47:08.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They cut it in half.<br>
<br>
<time begin="47:12.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In other words, the, uh, all<br>
the edges around the ghetto,<br>
<time begin="47:18.784"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and they told the Jews--<br>
<br>
<time begin="47:21.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
for the Jews to put an<br>
electric fence closer inside.<br>
<time begin="47:28.356"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I continued to<br>
work on that highway.<br>
<time begin="47:31.760"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN:<br>
And-- and the Jews,<br>
<time begin="47:33.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
your family and the other<br>
Jews, were they taken?<br>
<time begin="47:37.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
What happened to them?<br>
<br>
<time begin="47:38.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br>
they were taken.<br>
<time begin="47:39.804"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were led<br>
through the streets.<br>
<time begin="47:41.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were taken behind the<br>
town, and forced to undress,<br>
<time begin="47:48.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the, uh, the graves<br>
were already dug.<br>
<time begin="47:54.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It was already ready,<br>
and they shot 50 people<br>
<time begin="47:58.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
at a time right--<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:01.055"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
right on top of the cliff.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:05.095"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were all killed.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:06.602"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: What went<br>
through your mind then?<br>
<time begin="48:08.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Did you feel like you wanted<br>
to avenge their deaths?<br>
<time begin="48:10.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br>
that's the only thing<br>
<time begin="48:12.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was in my mind to avenge.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:15.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Well, I never believed<br>
I'll stay alive.<br>
<time begin="48:18.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But at least I should be<br>
able to avenge for the--<br>
<time begin="48:22.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
for what they did.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:25.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:26.314"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Something that-- has that<br>
stayed-- the feeling of it<br>
<time begin="48:28.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
stayed with you?<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:29.146"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I still--<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:30.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the feeling never changed.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:34.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Well, I can't feel exactly the<br>
same as I felt then, but I, uh,<br>
<time begin="48:41.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had that feeling all the time.<br>
<br>
<time begin="48:44.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and so<br>
what happened after that day?<br>
<time begin="48:48.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the, uh,<br>
the ghetto was shortened.<br>
<time begin="48:52.594"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The Judenrat actually<br>
was also killed.<br>
<time begin="48:57.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They told to the Judenrat.<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:00.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:03.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, they kept us<br>
alive till August--<br>
<time begin="49:10.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
August 6th, 1942,<br>
and, uh, August 6th ,<br>
<time begin="49:17.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
1942 happened the same thing.<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:21.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The-- the Germans and<br>
the Ukrainian police<br>
<time begin="49:27.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
surrounded-- surrounded<br>
the, uh, the ghetto<br>
<time begin="49:31.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and chased everybody<br>
out in the marketplace.<br>
<time begin="49:35.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But, uh, at that<br>
time, I didn't--<br>
<time begin="49:38.235"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I didn't run anymore to the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:40.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
on the marketplace<br>
we were hiding.<br>
<time begin="49:43.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:44.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Who-- who is we?<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:45.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You?<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:46.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You and your sister.<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:47.013"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: I, and my<br>
sister, and my cousin,<br>
<time begin="49:51.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
two cousins of mine.<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:53.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We were hiding in a--<br>
<br>
<time begin="49:56.675"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we-- we actually dug a<br>
hiding place under the floor.<br>
<time begin="50:03.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But being so close to the, uh,<br>
ghetto gate of the [INAUDIBLE]<br>
<time begin="50:10.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was the Germans where, the<br>
other side of the ghetto, they<br>
<time begin="50:14.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
had their, uh, the officers.<br>
<br>
<time begin="50:20.444"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We were afraid that close--<br>
<br>
<time begin="50:23.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
close-- being<br>
close to the ghetto<br>
<time begin="50:24.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
would be a lot worse if<br>
they start digging with<br>
<time begin="50:29.305"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
or searching with, uh, dogs.<br>
<br>
<time begin="50:33.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we were running--<br>
<br>
<time begin="50:36.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we were running in a<br>
place where my cousin<br>
<time begin="50:39.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was working as a carpenter.<br>
<br>
<time begin="50:43.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the-- the-- it<br>
was inside the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="50:49.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You could get in from inside<br>
and from outside the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="50:53.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The, uh-- in other words,<br>
the, uh, there was--<br>
<time begin="50:58.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the back of the building<br>
was inside the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="51:01.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The front of the building<br>
was out of the ghetto.<br>
<time begin="51:04.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we were running there<br>
and running-- and hiding<br>
<time begin="51:07.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the basement.<br>
<br>
<time begin="51:08.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
There wasn't a<br>
dark place to hide,<br>
<time begin="51:13.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but a plain, little basement<br>
and a tiny, little window.<br>
<time begin="51:18.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And we got into the basement<br>
and about 15 people there.<br>
<time begin="51:24.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Some came also running<br>
at that the place.<br>
<time begin="51:27.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We are hiding there a whole day,<br>
and through the little window,<br>
<time begin="51:32.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you could see that--<br>
<br>
<time begin="51:34.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the way the Germans chased<br>
the Jews to the marketplace<br>
<time begin="51:40.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and beating them.<br>
<br>
<time begin="51:43.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, towards evening, at<br>
night, we tried to get to--<br>
<time begin="51:50.753"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we tried to get out of there,<br>
because we knew we cannot stay<br>
<time begin="51:54.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there overnight.<br>
<br>
<time begin="51:57.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, somehow everybody<br>
wants to get out first<br>
<time begin="52:02.735"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and started to commotion<br>
inside when the,<br>
<time begin="52:07.962"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, the Germans with the<br>
Lithuanians and the Ukrainians<br>
<time begin="52:14.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were all helping the Germans,<br>
uh, in the gathering the Jews.<br>
<time begin="52:20.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They heard noise<br>
in the building.<br>
<time begin="52:23.682"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they, uh, first opened<br>
the door, and they caught us.<br>
<time begin="52:29.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, my cousin<br>
was a carpenter and I<br>
<time begin="52:32.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
started to beg the Germans as--<br>
<br>
<time begin="52:36.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
let us live.<br>
<br>
<time begin="52:38.036"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I-- I could carpent--<br>
<br>
<time begin="52:40.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I can.<br>
<br>
<time begin="52:42.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So the German<br>
answered, yeah, yeah.<br>
<time begin="52:46.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Tomorrow, we will take<br>
you to the new house.<br>
<time begin="52:50.412"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In other words, we knew that<br>
they were going to shoot us.<br>
<time begin="52:53.405"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they pushed us in<br>
back into the basement<br>
<time begin="52:57.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and put a heavy<br>
table on top of it.<br>
<time begin="53:01.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, outside they put<br>
a post working, watching,<br>
<time begin="53:09.830"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
watching the uh, the outside<br>
in the little window.<br>
<time begin="53:15.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But to our-- to<br>
our luck, the posts<br>
<time begin="53:19.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
sat down close to the<br>
window and fell asleep.<br>
<time begin="53:24.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the, uh, the window<br>
was too small for anybody<br>
<time begin="53:27.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to get-- to crawl through.<br>
<br>
<time begin="53:30.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we-- we stretched out all<br>
the cement around the window<br>
<time begin="53:34.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and made a bigger hole, and<br>
slowly, we took out the shoes,<br>
<time begin="53:41.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and slowly we--<br>
<br>
<time begin="53:42.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Escaped, yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="53:44.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: We, uh,<br>
called out, and we, uh,<br>
<time begin="53:48.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
said that we'll--<br>
<br>
<time begin="53:49.707"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we'll meet right in, uh, that.<br>
<br>
<time begin="53:53.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
A little river was<br>
running close by,<br>
<time begin="53:57.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and we said we shouldn't<br>
walk with the streets.<br>
<time begin="54:02.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We should, uh, go with the<br>
river, which takes us out<br>
<time begin="54:05.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in the outskirts of<br>
the-- of the town.<br>
<time begin="54:08.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And that way, we--<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:10.492"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: So<br>
you all escaped.<br>
<time begin="54:12.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Not all.<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:14.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
An older woman couldn't make it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:17.760"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Two-- two people still, because<br>
they found only two people<br>
<time begin="54:21.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there in the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:22.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
in the morning.<br>
<time begin="54:23.936"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: --in the<br>
basement the next day.<br>
<time begin="54:27.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They escaped, and we wandered<br>
around for, um, for, um,<br>
<time begin="54:35.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
until--<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:36.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
until it got, uh, light.<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:41.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They escaped, my sister,<br>
and I, and my two cousins<br>
<time begin="54:44.695"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were running together, and<br>
they came not very far.<br>
<time begin="54:51.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They ran away about 10<br>
kilometers out of town.<br>
<time begin="54:55.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it was already light.<br>
<br>
<time begin="54:58.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We couldn't walk any further,<br>
so we were hiding a little--<br>
<time begin="55:03.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the little forest was very--<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:06.408"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
it wasn't-- it was a very<br>
dangerous place to stay.<br>
<time begin="55:09.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But we crawled into a bush.<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:12.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We were hiding there.<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:14.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the shepherds could--<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:17.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, we could see the<br>
shepherds in the morning.<br>
<time begin="55:21.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And somehow, we are lucky<br>
that nobody noticed us<br>
<time begin="55:26.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the whole day.<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:28.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So the next evening,<br>
we were trying<br>
<time begin="55:34.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to get food into the<br>
forest, because the, uh,<br>
<time begin="55:40.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the forest around our<br>
town was only about,<br>
<time begin="55:46.205"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, 4 to 20 kilometers away.<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:50.029"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Were you planning<br>
then to join partisan groups?<br>
<time begin="55:52.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,<br>
that was the main idea,<br>
<time begin="55:54.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to join the partisans.<br>
<br>
<time begin="55:56.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, the next night, we<br>
came towards the, uh, forest<br>
<time begin="56:04.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
where the partisans were.<br>
<br>
<time begin="56:07.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But talking to a peasant,<br>
we knocked on the door,<br>
<time begin="56:14.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and eh opened the door<br>
to us, and he said--<br>
<time begin="56:17.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
he gave us bad news that<br>
the Russian partisans are--<br>
<time begin="56:23.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they are anti-Semitic, and they<br>
killed some Jewish partisans,<br>
<time begin="56:29.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
which was the leader,<br>
Alter Dvoretsky.<br>
<time begin="56:33.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He was killed, and he suggested<br>
we should go into, uh,<br>
<time begin="56:41.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there was a [SPEAKING GERMAN]<br>
like a working--<br>
<time begin="56:45.422"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, it was a camp, which<br>
was about 30 kilometers<br>
<time begin="56:51.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from our town, and the town<br>
was called [INAUDIBLE]..<br>
<time begin="56:55.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, there the Germans<br>
need these people, the Jews,<br>
<time begin="57:01.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to build for them an airport.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:04.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it was a chance to stay<br>
alive as that farmer suggested.<br>
<time begin="57:10.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And we took his advice, and<br>
we went towards that, uh,<br>
<time begin="57:14.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
camp, which was--<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:18.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
together was about 33<br>
kilometers to make.<br>
<time begin="57:21.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So to the next,<br>
towards [INAUDIBLE],,<br>
<time begin="57:27.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we went around our town<br>
towards that, uh, camp.<br>
<time begin="57:34.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And the next morning,<br>
we came-- we came--<br>
<time begin="57:38.381"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we finally came to that camp.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:40.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We joined a group<br>
of Jewish workers,<br>
<time begin="57:42.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and we got into that camp.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:45.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Our feet were swollen,<br>
because we were always<br>
<time begin="57:48.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
walking barefoot.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:50.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: And hungry.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:51.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And hungry.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:53.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But the conditions in that<br>
camp was just terrible.<br>
<time begin="57:57.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="57:58.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: It was summer.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:00.880"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
People slept under the sky.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:03.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:04.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh,<br>
there was very little food.<br>
<time begin="58:08.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And people had to carry stones<br>
from one place to the other<br>
<time begin="58:13.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to--<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:14.026"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to, uh, build that airport.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:18.775"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, the, uh, we couldn't<br>
work here, because we--<br>
<time begin="58:25.829"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
our feet were all--<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:26.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Was sore.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:27.578"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: --were<br>
beaten and swollen.<br>
<time begin="58:29.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So but they forced<br>
us to go to work.<br>
<time begin="58:33.075"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Who-- were these<br>
not Germans again or Russians?<br>
<time begin="58:36.280"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Who?<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:37.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No,<br>
the, uh, the people<br>
<time begin="58:40.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
who watched us were<br>
actually Ukrainians.<br>
<time begin="58:43.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And there were Jewish police.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:46.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The Germans always had this<br>
streak to-- the-- to have<br>
<time begin="58:52.660"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
their--<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:53.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
their own-- their<br>
own people to--<br>
<time begin="58:56.545"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to do the bad job.<br>
<br>
<time begin="58:58.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So the Jewish police would<br>
chase down the Jews to work.<br>
<time begin="59:04.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Actually, they had to.<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:05.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They had no choice.<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:06.353"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:07.103"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So you-- you--<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:08.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you are sympathetic to their<br>
position, the Jewish police.<br>
<time begin="59:11.820"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You don't feel any--<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:14.376"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they didn't<br>
do anything that they could help<br>
<time begin="59:16.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
it .<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:17.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
A lot of them were<br>
actually in the partisans,<br>
<time begin="59:19.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
were running away to<br>
the partisans together.<br>
<time begin="59:21.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But, uh, they had no choice.<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:26.056"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
They were appointed<br>
by the Germans,<br>
<time begin="59:28.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and they to do what the<br>
Germans told them to do.<br>
<time begin="59:33.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, finally by--<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:38.240"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
by being there about<br>
three weeks, we did--<br>
<time begin="59:41.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I, for example, had to--<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:43.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
was chased out to go to work<br>
on the carrying the stones.<br>
<time begin="59:49.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I was looking for a way<br>
to go back to the partisans<br>
<time begin="59:53.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
till I--<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:54.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
one day, I found--<br>
<br>
<time begin="59:56.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I noticed someone who I<br>
knew went to the forest<br>
<time begin="60:01.155"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
yet before the slaughter<br>
of the Jews in our town.<br>
<time begin="60:06.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And when I talked to<br>
him, and we met up,<br>
<time begin="60:11.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they said that he<br>
came to pick up Jews<br>
<time begin="60:14.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
from this camp to the forest.<br>
<br>
<time begin="60:20.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And he gave me a<br>
[INAUDIBLE],, a map how to--<br>
<time begin="60:23.995"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: To get there.<br>
<br>
<time begin="60:25.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: Go around.<br>
<br>
<time begin="60:26.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Not to go to villages or to, uh,<br>
in other words, to be careful<br>
<time begin="60:34.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
not to fall into certain,<br>
uh, certain peasants who<br>
<time begin="60:40.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
helped the Germans.<br>
<br>
<time begin="60:42.995"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, and, uh,<br>
one-- one evening,<br>
<time begin="60:49.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
instead of going back to the--<br>
<br>
<time begin="60:52.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the ghetto, there<br>
was also a ghetto<br>
<time begin="60:53.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
in that camp, sort of a<br>
ghetto, I stayed behind a--<br>
<time begin="60:59.246"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
a hump of stones.<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:02.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, we left that camp.<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:07.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: You, and<br>
your sister, and cousins.<br>
<time begin="61:09.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: My sister<br>
and my two cousins.<br>
<time begin="61:11.860"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:12.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: And<br>
another two, six of us,<br>
<time begin="61:17.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and we made it during<br>
the night to the forest.<br>
<time begin="61:21.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:22.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Well, I think we finished<br>
the first half of the tape.<br>
<time begin="61:25.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So--<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:26.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:26.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: They are going<br>
to rewind it and then--<br>
<time begin="61:27.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.<br>
<br>
<time begin="61:28.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: --we<br>
can start from the--<br>
<time begin="61:30.517"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, in<br>
the [INAUDIBLE] forest.<br>
<time begin="61:32.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
SANDY HAYDEN: In a<br>
few minutes, yeah.<br>
<time begin="61:34.500"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
