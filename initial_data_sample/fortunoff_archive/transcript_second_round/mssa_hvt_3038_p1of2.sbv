00:00:32.910,00:00:33.410
Poland.

00:00:33.410,00:00:35.290
Can you tell us what the
name of the town was?

00:00:35.290,00:00:37.225
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, the
name of town is Zdzieciol.

00:00:37.225,00:00:37.830
SANDY HAYDEN: Zdzieciol.

00:00:37.830,00:00:38.610

00:00:38.610,00:00:39.484
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:00:39.484,00:00:41.955
RUBIN PINSKI: In
Russian, it was Dyatlovo.

00:00:41.955,00:00:43.040
SANDY HAYDEN: Dyatlovo.

00:00:43.040,00:00:46.992
RUBIN PINSKI: And well-known
in the Yiddish name, Zhetel.

00:00:46.992,00:00:48.600
SANDY HAYDEN: Zhetel.

00:00:48.600,00:00:51.020
So how-- how do you--
how do you refer to it?

00:00:51.020,00:00:55.030
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, among
friends and among, uh, people,

00:00:55.030,00:00:56.290
call it Zhetel [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:56.290,00:00:59.794
SANDY HAYDEN: OK, so can
we call it-- can we call it

00:00:59.794,00:01:00.960
Zhetel during the interview?

00:01:00.960,00:01:01.652
I think--

00:01:01.652,00:01:02.114
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I think--

00:01:02.114,00:01:03.500
SANDY HAYDEN: A little
easier for me to say

00:01:03.500,00:01:04.424
Zhetel than Zdzieciol.

00:01:04.424,00:01:07.400
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, well,
it's a very well-known town.

00:01:07.400,00:01:10.820
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, and
um, on the map here, it--

00:01:10.820,00:01:14.070

a little earlier on that

00:01:14.070,00:01:17.203
it's, um, it has a
number of big cities--

00:01:17.203,00:01:23.461
RUBIN PINSKI: Big cities around
it, yes, which is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:23.461,00:01:28.040
And, uh, we are also west
of, uh, [INAUDIBLE]----

00:01:28.040,00:01:28.900
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

00:01:28.900,00:01:33.130
RUBIN PINSKI: --about 150
kilometers between [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:33.130,00:01:36.380
Uh, our town, Zhetel,
was, uh, city's leader.

00:01:36.380,00:01:39.311
It's also well-known city.

00:01:39.311,00:01:43.760
On the other side
towards Minsk was, uh,

00:01:43.760,00:01:45.356
city in the name of [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:45.356,00:01:47.760
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, and did-- did

00:01:47.760,00:01:50.395
you used to travel
often to these cities?

00:01:50.395,00:01:51.890
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, not often.

00:01:51.890,00:01:52.820
I was very young.

00:01:52.820,00:01:53.695
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:01:53.695,00:01:57.230
RUBIN PINSKI: I was just,
uh, uh, school, uh, child.

00:01:57.230,00:02:00.245
So I didn't have a chance
to travel too much.

00:02:00.245,00:02:01.120
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:02:01.120,00:02:03.620
And how big was-- how many
people were-- were in--

00:02:03.620,00:02:04.563
in Zhetel?

00:02:04.563,00:02:07.680
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the
whole population was only

00:02:07.680,00:02:10.960
about, uh, 7,500 to 8,000.

00:02:10.960,00:02:11.925
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:02:11.925,00:02:15.195
RUBIN PINSKI: And at least
60% of them are Jews.

00:02:15.195,00:02:16.070
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:02:16.070,00:02:19.670
So you-- you felt that
it was more Jewish--

00:02:19.670,00:02:22.130
you felt the Jewish community
very strongly there.

00:02:22.130,00:02:22.510
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:02:22.510,00:02:22.890
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:02:22.890,00:02:25.010
And was sort of Jewish
community was it?

00:02:25.010,00:02:26.615
Was it orthodox or?

00:02:26.615,00:02:28.260
RUBIN PINSKI:
Well, of all kinds.

00:02:28.260,00:02:34.490
Um, the, uh, the youth were
very-- very Zionist-minded.

00:02:34.490,00:02:38.090
There was [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
in our town.

00:02:38.090,00:02:43.480
The extreme right,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:02:43.480,00:02:45.650
There are also
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:02:45.650,00:02:48.320
which is socialist.

00:02:48.320,00:02:52.760
Some very few communist
youth, all kinds

00:02:52.760,00:02:55.030
of, uh, organizations.

00:02:55.030,00:02:56.476
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:02:56.476,00:02:59.216
And was your family attached
to any organization?

00:02:59.216,00:03:01.485
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, my
father was religious.

00:03:01.485,00:03:03.026
SANDY HAYDEN: He
was religious, yeah.

00:03:03.026,00:03:05.420

00:03:05.420,00:03:06.980
to [INAUDIBLE] Israel.

00:03:06.980,00:03:10.440
This is a religious
organization.

00:03:10.440,00:03:14.882
And I-- I finished
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:03:14.882,00:03:20.060
And, uh, also [? learning ?]
in [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:03:20.060,00:03:21.460
which it was called.

00:03:21.460,00:03:22.388
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:03:22.388,00:03:25.230
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, then I--

00:03:25.230,00:03:30.020
when I was 13, I was
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:03:30.020,00:03:33.170
It was not far from
our town, another town

00:03:33.170,00:03:35.198
called [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:35.198,00:03:40.092
They had a [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
on the, uh,

00:03:40.092,00:03:42.330
it was called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] from

00:03:42.330,00:03:44.510
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:03:44.510,00:03:46.310
And I was there till--

00:03:46.310,00:03:47.570
till 1939.

00:03:47.570,00:03:48.770
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:03:48.770,00:03:51.785
So you-- you had-- you had
really a religious upbringing

00:03:51.785,00:03:52.284
then?

00:03:52.284,00:03:53.700
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
religious, yes.

00:03:53.700,00:03:57.260
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and your
early schooling was just

00:03:57.260,00:04:00.910
at in the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
with other young Jewish boys

00:04:00.910,00:04:01.420
like you?

00:04:01.420,00:04:02.920
RUBIN PINSKI:
[INAUDIBLE] once, yes.

00:04:02.920,00:04:03.794
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:04:03.794,00:04:05.520
And-- and you learned
all the subjects--

00:04:05.520,00:04:07.310
arithmetic and
reading and writing.

00:04:07.310,00:04:11.360
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, this we
learned because the school was

00:04:11.360,00:04:13.270
subsidized by the government.

00:04:13.270,00:04:16.970
And we had to do
it to a half a day.

00:04:16.970,00:04:18.390
And all these other--

00:04:18.390,00:04:25.245
other subjects mainly
was [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:04:25.245,00:04:26.120
SANDY HAYDEN: Mm-hmm.

00:04:26.120,00:04:28.580
So that was-- half the day was--

00:04:28.580,00:04:30.026
was-- was, um, school.

00:04:30.026,00:04:32.150
And the half-- other half
of the day was religious.

00:04:32.150,00:04:32.590
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:04:32.590,00:04:33.610
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:04:33.610,00:04:36.060
And did you, as a young
boy, did you enjoy that?

00:04:36.060,00:04:36.490
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

00:04:36.490,00:04:36.740
I--

00:04:36.740,00:04:37.430
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, he did.

00:04:37.430,00:04:39.650
You just never-- he never
thought, oh, I don't really

00:04:39.650,00:04:40.460
like going.

00:04:40.460,00:04:44.420
Or it wasn't too-- it-- it
wasn't-- you didn't see other

00:04:44.420,00:04:48.020
Jewish boys who maybe had half
the afternoon free because they

00:04:48.020,00:04:50.470
weren't going to town with
[INAUDIBLE] something.

00:04:50.470,00:04:54.440
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, there was
also a Yiddish [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:54.440,00:04:57.480
And [INAUDIBLE],, as I
said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:04:57.480,00:04:59.512
Hebrew only.

00:04:59.512,00:05:02.075
And, uh, the youth
used to get together,

00:05:02.075,00:05:04.456
and we had
discussions for hours,

00:05:04.456,00:05:06.640
had the discussions,
one with another.

00:05:06.640,00:05:09.417
[INAUDIBLE] religious
youth and the--

00:05:09.417,00:05:10.848
SANDY HAYDEN: Zionists, yeah.

00:05:10.848,00:05:15.240
RUBIN PINSKI: The-- the
other real nice gathering

00:05:15.240,00:05:16.194
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:16.194,00:05:18.475
SANDY HAYDEN: And--
and your father--

00:05:18.475,00:05:22.519
your father let you associate
with all the other Jewish boys,

00:05:22.519,00:05:23.810
even if they weren't religious?

00:05:23.810,00:05:23.950
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

00:05:23.950,00:05:25.075
SANDY HAYDEN: That wasn't--

00:05:25.075,00:05:28.115
RUBIN PINSKI: It was, uh,
a habit that Saturday.

00:05:28.115,00:05:32.240
My father used to
take, uh, the, uh,

00:05:32.240,00:05:35.570
children and study
with them [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.570,00:05:38.514
while other children were
playing football or something

00:05:38.514,00:05:39.540
like that.

00:05:39.540,00:05:45.560
But we had to obli--
oblige to our parents and--

00:05:45.560,00:05:48.941
and, uh, and do it for
them because, uh, we

00:05:48.941,00:05:50.966
always suspected our parents.

00:05:50.966,00:05:52.680
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:52.680,00:05:53.592
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

00:05:53.592,00:05:56.159
Saturdays, we used to see people
study with our [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:56.159,00:05:57.450
SANDY HAYDEN: With your father.

00:05:57.450,00:05:59.200

RUBIN PINSKI: Four.

00:06:03.184,00:06:04.105
SANDY HAYDEN: Four.

00:06:04.105,00:06:06.990
Can you tell-- were
you the oldest, or--

00:06:06.990,00:06:08.653
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I
was the third one.

00:06:08.653,00:06:09.980
SANDY HAYDEN: The third one.

00:06:09.980,00:06:11.840
RUBIN PINSKI: My
sister was the oldest.

00:06:11.840,00:06:15.422
I had a brother and myself,
and I had a younger sister,

00:06:15.422,00:06:19.680
which perished in the--

00:06:19.680,00:06:20.802

SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:06:22.610,00:06:26.810
And, um, what-- what did your
father do as a profession?

00:06:26.810,00:06:31.620
RUBIN PINSKI: He used to buy
grain from the farmers, grain

00:06:31.620,00:06:40.930
and, uh, other things and sell
it in, uh, a bigger wholesale.

00:06:40.930,00:06:43.570
He used-- in other words, he
used to buy it from the farmers

00:06:43.570,00:06:45.634
to sell it in the--

00:06:45.634,00:06:48.330
in the bigger-- in

00:06:48.330,00:06:49.080
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:06:49.080,00:06:51.680
And so did he sell it-- did
he sell it in-- in the town,

00:06:51.680,00:06:53.800
or did he take it to
the bigger cities?

00:06:53.800,00:06:54.990
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

00:06:54.990,00:06:57.810
He sold it in the
town to someone

00:06:57.810,00:07:00.710
who used to buy from everybody.

00:07:00.710,00:07:02.690
Also, he used to deal with--

00:07:02.690,00:07:05.432

00:07:05.432,00:07:08.560
what was it called?

00:07:08.560,00:07:10.110
Mushrooms.

00:07:10.110,00:07:14.840
Dried mushrooms like--
and all kinds of--

00:07:14.840,00:07:20.340
all sorts of the-- the farmers
used to sell in the city.

00:07:20.340,00:07:23.790
SANDY HAYDEN: So he used to deal
with all sorts of produce then?

00:07:23.790,00:07:24.840
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:07:24.840,00:07:26.090

SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:07:28.855,00:07:31.390
Can you-- can you

RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

Very educated and, uh,
like a Jewish mother,

and raise the children.

00:07:50.042,00:07:52.950

00:07:52.950,00:07:54.340
Like a real good Jewish mother.

00:07:54.340,00:07:56.650
SANDY HAYDEN: Good
Jewish mother, yeah.

00:07:56.650,00:07:58.900
And did you have
quite a bit of family,

00:07:58.900,00:08:00.430
cousins, and aunts, and uncles?

00:08:00.430,00:08:01.180
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

Um, not far from our house

00:08:13.848,00:08:17.220
And my father's family
was in another city.

00:08:26.900,00:08:31.869
And he had a brother, and
sisters, and a mother.

00:08:31.869,00:08:36.728
As a matter of fact, it was only
once in my life in that town

00:08:36.728,00:08:37.853
where my father comes from.

00:08:37.853,00:08:38.820
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:08:38.820,00:08:40.895
RUBIN PINSKI: I was only
eight, nine years old.

00:08:40.895,00:08:42.020
SANDY HAYDEN: So they did--

00:08:42.020,00:08:45.650
RUBIN PINSKI: I remember it
very vaguely about that town.

00:08:45.650,00:08:46.840
SANDY HAYDEN: So you much--

00:08:46.840,00:08:48.220
really, you had
much more contact

00:08:48.220,00:08:50.110
with your mother's
side of the family.

00:08:50.110,00:08:51.096
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:08:51.096,00:08:52.220
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

00:08:52.220,00:08:55.435
you used to spend all
holidays and celebrations?

00:08:55.435,00:08:57.833
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we used
to get together on holidays.

00:08:57.833,00:09:01.270

00:09:01.270,00:09:04.204
And sometimes in the middle
of the week, we used to--

00:09:04.204,00:09:10.860
I used to play with my
cousins like a normal--

00:09:10.860,00:09:12.740
normal way of--

00:09:12.740,00:09:14.030
SANDY HAYDEN: Of growing up.

00:09:14.030,00:09:16.801
RUBIN PINSKI: A fun
way of growing up, yes.

00:09:16.801,00:09:18.220
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- the--

00:09:18.220,00:09:21.300
the other 40% of
people who lived

00:09:21.300,00:09:23.730
in the town, who were they?

00:09:23.730,00:09:25.050
Were they Poles?

00:09:25.050,00:09:29.200
RUBIN PINSKI: A lot
of them were farmers.

00:09:29.200,00:09:34.000
And some were the, uh--
the administration--

00:09:34.000,00:09:37.820
the Polish administration
like policeman--

00:09:37.820,00:09:39.160
there was a magistrate.

00:09:39.160,00:09:42.200
It's like a city hall here.

00:09:42.200,00:09:47.530
And the, uh, the
mayor was a Pole.

00:09:47.530,00:09:51.410
And the secretaries were Poles.

00:09:51.410,00:09:55.390
And, uh, there was--
there wasn't a very big

00:09:55.390,00:09:58.630
administration in our town.

00:09:58.630,00:10:02.965
But, uh, and-- and
enough Poles to--

00:10:02.965,00:10:07.090
to collect taxes and--

00:10:07.090,00:10:10.832
and look after all the, uh--

00:10:10.832,00:10:12.040
SANDY HAYDEN: Administration.

00:10:12.040,00:10:13.840
RUBIN PINSKI: Administration
of the city, yeah.

00:10:13.840,00:10:16.131
SANDY HAYDEN: So that's really
all that they did there,

00:10:16.131,00:10:18.760
and the Jews were--

00:10:18.760,00:10:21.197
the Jews were involved in all
sorts of other professions

00:10:21.197,00:10:21.696
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:21.696,00:10:25.780
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yeah, the Jews
were all kinds of professions.

00:10:25.780,00:10:34.870
Shoe-- shoemakers, fixing shoes,
and tailors, a lot of tailors,

00:10:34.870,00:10:42.220
and, uh, storekeepers, like
groceries and selling fabric.

00:10:42.220,00:10:45.310
That was also developed
a lot in our town,

00:10:45.310,00:10:49.690
selling leather, leather
soles and leather--

00:10:49.690,00:10:51.490
the shoes were made by hand.

00:10:51.490,00:10:52.240
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:10:52.240,00:10:53.010
Really?

00:10:53.010,00:10:55.030
Everybody's shoes
were made by hand.

00:10:55.030,00:10:57.962
RUBIN PINSKI: But there
was only one store--

00:10:57.962,00:11:02.890
while I was going up, I
remember started butter shoes.

00:11:02.890,00:11:08.590
And one store of
butter shoes opened up,

00:11:08.590,00:11:11.740
but until then,
there was no stores,

00:11:11.740,00:11:13.586
no shoes where they made shoes.

00:11:13.586,00:11:14.710
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, yeah.

00:11:14.710,00:11:16.728
RUBIN PINSKI: All made by hand.

00:11:16.728,00:11:18.360
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:11:18.360,00:11:21.640
And-- and-- um, I
suppose that there

00:11:21.640,00:11:25.762
were no Jews who were farmers
or landowners around the town.

00:11:25.762,00:11:27.220
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
there were a few

00:11:27.220,00:11:31.480
also had some farms,
not big ones, small--

00:11:31.480,00:11:32.120
small farms.

00:11:32.120,00:11:34.880
SANDY HAYDEN: So they were
allowed to own the land, and--

00:11:34.880,00:11:36.630
RUBIN PINSKI: And they
were doing the same

00:11:36.630,00:11:39.361
as other farmers,
but not too many.

00:11:39.361,00:11:40.110
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:11:40.110,00:11:44.142
RUBIN PINSKI: There were in
the villages around the town,

00:11:44.142,00:11:49.220
there were quite a few
Jews in the farming,

00:11:49.220,00:11:51.530
like in the other--

00:11:51.530,00:11:54.480
peasant, non-Jews,
peasants, they also

00:11:54.480,00:12:00.484
owned a couple of hectares
of land and lived from that.

00:12:00.484,00:12:01.360
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:12:01.360,00:12:03.520
RUBIN PINSKI: But in
the town, there was--

00:12:03.520,00:12:04.960
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:04.960,00:12:11.410
RUBIN PINSKI: Mostly the
Jews were like professionals,

00:12:11.410,00:12:14.879
like shoemakers, and tailors.

00:12:14.879,00:12:15.920
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:15.920,00:12:19.270
RUBIN PINSKI: And a lot of
Jews were just starting--

00:12:19.270,00:12:21.365
sitting and starting
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:21.365,00:12:22.910
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

00:12:22.910,00:12:25.210
And what does-- what
were the relationships

00:12:25.210,00:12:28.320
like between the Jews and
the Poles in the town?

00:12:28.320,00:12:31.030
RUBIN PINSKI: As a matter fact,
the relationship was very good.

00:12:31.030,00:12:32.330
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah?

00:12:32.330,00:12:36.670
RUBIN PINSKI: Especially with
the white Russians in our town.

00:12:36.670,00:12:40.370
The white Russians
were very nice to us.

00:12:40.370,00:12:42.990
The Poles themselves
were anti-Semitic.

00:12:42.990,00:12:43.990
SANDY HAYDEN: They were?

00:12:43.990,00:12:44.340
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:12:44.340,00:12:46.517
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
experienced that right from--

00:12:46.517,00:12:47.350
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:12:47.350,00:12:48.474
SANDY HAYDEN: An early age.

00:12:48.474,00:12:53.700
RUBIN PINSKI: Since Hitler
came to power in 1933, the, uh,

00:12:53.700,00:12:56.290
Poles became different.

00:12:56.290,00:12:57.617
They were already anti-Semitic.

00:12:57.617,00:12:58.575
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you--

00:12:58.575,00:13:01.310
can you remember in what
way they became different?

00:13:01.310,00:13:06.345
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, in the
last years in 1937, '38,

00:13:06.345,00:13:13.660
I remember they used to come
from bigger cities, young Poles

00:13:13.660,00:13:19.290
and carrying placards
saying, don't buy from Jews

00:13:19.290,00:13:22.560
and, uh, buy from Poles only.

00:13:22.560,00:13:25.970
And the anti-Semitism
started already to grow.

00:13:25.970,00:13:27.365
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:13:27.365,00:13:30.070
And do you remember-- do you
remember talking about it

00:13:30.070,00:13:33.690
as a young boy or hearing
your father and mother

00:13:33.690,00:13:34.474
talk about it.

00:13:34.474,00:13:35.890
Were they worried
about it at all?

00:13:35.890,00:13:37.330
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, we all--

00:13:37.330,00:13:41.520
we knew already what
actually from the papers,

00:13:41.520,00:13:44.910
from the Jewish papers we
used to guess from, uh,

00:13:44.910,00:13:50.640
the [INAUDIBLE],, like it was,
uh, produced in, uh, Warsaw.

00:13:50.640,00:13:52.330
We used to get these papers.

00:13:52.330,00:13:54.980
And we heard what going
on in German, what

00:13:54.980,00:13:57.360
the Germans did to the Jews.

00:13:57.360,00:13:59.140
So we were already scared.

00:13:59.140,00:13:59.890
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:13:59.890,00:14:02.556
You were worried that that could
start happening in Poland also.

00:14:02.556,00:14:04.950
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, we were
very worried and scared

00:14:04.950,00:14:08.700
in the last few years
before the war broke out.

00:14:08.700,00:14:09.450
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:14:09.450,00:14:13.620
And even though the Jews were
the majority in your town, you

00:14:13.620,00:14:16.931
still, the Poles were
still openly anti-Semitic.

00:14:16.931,00:14:17.930
They weren't scared of--

00:14:17.930,00:14:18.650
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

00:14:18.650,00:14:19.670
SANDY HAYDEN: --of [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:19.670,00:14:22.045
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they were--
they were very anti-Semitic

00:14:22.045,00:14:25.887
openly, but not actually not
the local Poles, always--

00:14:25.887,00:14:27.720
SANDY HAYDEN: Oh, always
Poles that came by.

00:14:27.720,00:14:28.636
RUBIN PINSKI: Came by.

00:14:28.636,00:14:33.600
And they also planted, uh,
anti-Semitism into the Poles

00:14:33.600,00:14:36.010
in our town.

00:14:36.010,00:14:39.000
But with the white
Russians, neighbors,

00:14:39.000,00:14:42.300
we lived in very peaceful.

00:14:42.300,00:14:46.160
And they were very nice.

00:14:46.160,00:14:50.100
SANDY HAYDEN: So when-- when
did all of that start to change?

00:14:50.100,00:14:53.160
RUBIN PINSKI: The last couple
of years, uh, before the war

00:14:53.160,00:14:54.570
started.

00:14:54.570,00:14:58.339
That-- wars, and
wars, and wars always.

00:14:58.339,00:15:00.380
SANDY HAYDEN: And with--
with the- white Russians

00:15:00.380,00:15:03.570
and the Poles in the town
also or still just the people

00:15:03.570,00:15:04.660
who were passing through?

00:15:04.660,00:15:05.659
RUBIN PINSKI: The Poles.

00:15:05.659,00:15:08.640
And some-- not too
many white Russians

00:15:08.640,00:15:13.850
became already a little bit
also with a cold shoulder

00:15:13.850,00:15:16.022
toward the Jews.

00:15:16.022,00:15:21.808
They were already, uh, showing
anti-Semitic, uh, tendencies.

00:15:21.808,00:15:24.682

00:15:24.682,00:15:26.400
SANDY HAYDEN: And, um, can you--

00:15:26.400,00:15:30.720
can you describe what
happened, um, in 1939 when--

00:15:30.720,00:15:31.365
when--

00:15:31.365,00:15:35.090
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, well,
when the war broke out,

00:15:35.090,00:15:42.600
when the Germans attacked
Poland, the Poles, a lot

00:15:42.600,00:15:47.220
of Polish, uh, soldiers were
running through our town

00:15:47.220,00:15:48.910
towards Russia.

00:15:48.910,00:15:52.610
They were escaping
from the Germans.

00:15:52.610,00:16:01.090
And, uh, the war broke out on
the 1st of September, 1939.

00:16:01.090,00:16:08.460
And I think it was the 17th of
September the Russians came in

00:16:08.460,00:16:11.120
from-- from Minsk,
from the other side

00:16:11.120,00:16:14.090
and occupied our town.

00:16:14.090,00:16:21.780
And we came under the Russian
government and the Russian, uh,

00:16:21.780,00:16:22.734
occupation.

00:16:22.734,00:16:24.150
SANDY HAYDEN: And
did things start

00:16:24.150,00:16:25.752
to change very
much at that time?

00:16:25.752,00:16:27.460
RUBIN PINSKI: Changed--
it changed very--

00:16:27.460,00:16:29.080
very rapidly, yes.

00:16:29.080,00:16:32.614
SANDY HAYDEN: How old
were you, um, when the--

00:16:32.614,00:16:33.530
RUBIN PINSKI: In 1939?

00:16:33.530,00:16:34.321
SANDY HAYDEN: 1939.

00:16:34.321,00:16:35.640
You mind me asking you?

00:16:35.640,00:16:37.460
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I
was only 15 years old.

00:16:37.460,00:16:38.944
SANDY HAYDEN: 15 years old.

00:16:38.944,00:16:39.386
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:16:39.386,00:16:40.270
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:16:40.270,00:16:43.095
So you were a young-- you
were a young boy then?

00:16:43.095,00:16:44.490
RUBIN PINSKI: Very young boy.

00:16:44.490,00:16:45.603
SANDY HAYDEN: Do
you remember-- do

00:16:45.603,00:16:46.977
you remember some
of the feelings

00:16:46.977,00:16:49.242
that you had when-- when--
when the Russians occupied

00:16:49.242,00:16:49.742
your town?

00:16:49.742,00:16:52.230
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, when the
Russians came, I mean, we--

00:16:52.230,00:16:54.805
we accepted them with open arms.

00:16:54.805,00:16:55.680
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:16:55.680,00:16:57.230
You mean rather than
have the Germans--

00:16:57.230,00:16:58.355
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

00:16:58.355,00:17:00.410
We knew what the
Germans did to the Jews.

00:17:00.410,00:17:04.589
And they-- they were
actually, uh, liberators.

00:17:04.589,00:17:09.566
And they behaved very
nice except some of the--

00:17:09.566,00:17:13.970
from the rich Jews
took away the--

00:17:13.970,00:17:14.910
their stores.

00:17:14.910,00:17:19.339
Anybody who had a fabric
store, other kinds of stores,

00:17:19.339,00:17:22.050
they confiscated it.

00:17:22.050,00:17:25.655
But they let the
people work for them,

00:17:25.655,00:17:28.089
and they found
jobs for everybody.

00:17:28.089,00:17:32.220
And life went on fine.

00:17:32.220,00:17:33.720
SANDY HAYDEN: But
you were hearing--

00:17:33.720,00:17:37.590
you were hearing reports of
what was going on in Germany.

00:17:37.590,00:17:40.390
Can you tell me what some of
the things that you heard in--

00:17:40.390,00:17:45.060
RUBIN PINSKI: They used to
hear only from the paper

00:17:45.060,00:17:47.570
what the Germans behaved--

00:17:47.570,00:17:52.121
did bad to the Germans
Jews, also to the, uh--

00:17:52.121,00:17:58.680
when we heard the trouble
before the Russians came in.

00:17:58.680,00:18:02.270
We knew what's going more
or less on in the paper.

00:18:02.270,00:18:04.980
But the Russians concealed
from us everything.

00:18:04.980,00:18:09.175
They didn't know what's going
on in the other half of Poland.

00:18:09.175,00:18:10.925
SANDY HAYDEN: Really,
once they occupied--

00:18:10.925,00:18:12.300
RUBIN PINSKI: Once
they occupied,

00:18:12.300,00:18:14.975
we didn't know anything, just--

00:18:14.975,00:18:17.550
they told us what they
wanted to tell us.

00:18:17.550,00:18:20.570
SANDY HAYDEN: So did--
did you feel at any time

00:18:20.570,00:18:23.160
that you and your family
would like to escape or to go

00:18:23.160,00:18:24.320
to another part of Europe?

00:18:24.320,00:18:26.450
Or did you feel
that you would just

00:18:26.450,00:18:28.237
stay their for the meantime?

00:18:28.237,00:18:29.570
RUBIN PINSKI: Even if you felt--

00:18:29.570,00:18:31.010
but we couldn't do anything--

00:18:31.010,00:18:32.635
SANDY HAYDEN: You
didn't have a chance.

00:18:32.635,00:18:36.295
RUBIN PINSKI: --because
the Russian policy was you,

00:18:36.295,00:18:39.180
uh, if you are not with
us, you are against us.

00:18:39.180,00:18:42.990
In other words, if you
want to go away, you are--

00:18:42.990,00:18:44.613
you are our enemy.

00:18:44.613,00:18:45.363
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:18:45.363,00:18:47.216
So that was dangerous
for you too.

00:18:47.216,00:18:48.590
RUBIN PINSKI: So
we couldn't even

00:18:48.590,00:18:53.150
think of escaping or
going anywhere then.

00:18:53.150,00:18:56.390
We didn't have the
money to go too.

00:18:56.390,00:18:58.832
There was no-- nowhere to go.

00:18:58.832,00:19:00.290
SANDY HAYDEN: But
when the Russians

00:19:00.290,00:19:03.270
came to occupy
[INAUDIBLE],, you must

00:19:03.270,00:19:06.562
have been at you-- at yeshiva
in the neighboring town?

00:19:06.562,00:19:07.770
Or had you come back in town.

00:19:07.770,00:19:11.390
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I came back
to our town, because the, uh,

00:19:11.390,00:19:15.240
Russians, they didn't exactly--

00:19:15.240,00:19:19.490
they didn't say you
can do it, but so--

00:19:19.490,00:19:24.310
all the religious issues
disappeared somehow.

00:19:24.310,00:19:25.720
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:19:25.720,00:19:28.350
RUBIN PINSKI: The,
uh, officially,

00:19:28.350,00:19:31.970
they didn't say you
cannot go to synagogue,

00:19:31.970,00:19:35.210
because the Jews went
to synagogue while, uh--

00:19:35.210,00:19:38.120
while they were in occupation.

00:19:38.120,00:19:42.880
But somehow, the Jews
alone were afraid to do it.

00:19:42.880,00:19:43.840
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:19:43.840,00:19:46.480
So-- so yeshivas closed down?

00:19:46.480,00:19:48.840
RUBIN PINSKI: There was no--
no more yeshivas at all.

00:19:48.840,00:19:53.270
And then we-- we um, had
to go to Russian schools

00:19:53.270,00:19:54.180
to learn Russian.

00:19:54.180,00:19:54.930
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:19:54.930,00:19:56.330
So that's what you did
when you went back home.

00:19:56.330,00:19:57.280
RUBIN PINSKI: That's
what I did, yes.

00:19:57.280,00:19:59.030
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were at-- at a school

00:19:59.030,00:20:00.840
with Russians and Poles.

00:20:00.840,00:20:02.849
And it was now a
mix-- a mixed school.

00:20:02.849,00:20:05.015
RUBIN PINSKI: Mixed, but
we-- we taught the subjects

00:20:05.015,00:20:06.550
that are only Russian.

00:20:06.550,00:20:08.457
We started a new
language altogether.

00:20:08.457,00:20:10.040
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how was-- how was it

00:20:10.040,00:20:12.080
going to a school
like that, because it

00:20:12.080,00:20:14.510
seems to be very different
from what you were used to?

00:20:14.510,00:20:17.590
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, uh, but we--

00:20:17.590,00:20:19.640
we could learn,
because the language

00:20:19.640,00:20:26.630
itself was, uh, was a lot easier
to catch, because the white--

00:20:26.630,00:20:28.610
white Russian is
similar to Russian.

00:20:28.610,00:20:33.520
Polish is also a bit
similar in a way.

00:20:33.520,00:20:38.320
And the-- the writing
and reading was harder,

00:20:38.320,00:20:41.270
but the speaking, we
caught on very fast.

00:20:41.270,00:20:42.020
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:20:42.020,00:20:44.864
And how was it to be
in the class with, um,

00:20:44.864,00:20:47.632
with other children, with the
Russian and Polish children?

00:20:47.632,00:20:49.840
Did you get on with them,
or was there anti-Semitism?

00:20:49.840,00:20:50.870
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:20:50.870,00:20:52.880
No, no, there was
no anti-Semitism,

00:20:52.880,00:20:58.105
because, uh, they--
they knew that uh,

00:20:58.105,00:21:03.300
the Russians in the
Russian government,

00:21:03.300,00:21:04.900
there was no
anti-Semitism at all.

00:21:04.900,00:21:07.060
Everybody is the same.

00:21:07.060,00:21:14.000
And actually, they used to, uh,
punish for anti-Semitic, uh,

00:21:14.000,00:21:15.190
the writing--

00:21:15.190,00:21:16.910
saying.

00:21:16.910,00:21:18.642
They, uh, used to--

00:21:18.642,00:21:20.295
people are afraid
to be anti-Semitic.

00:21:20.295,00:21:21.170
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:21:21.170,00:21:23.359
And the Poles also then
were afraid in school

00:21:23.359,00:21:24.150
to be anti-Semitic.

00:21:24.150,00:21:26.660
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
actually, the Poles,

00:21:26.660,00:21:28.520
the few Poles that
were in our town

00:21:28.520,00:21:34.040
disappeared, the ones that were
in the administration before.

00:21:34.040,00:21:40.615
And the-- the Polish
farmers behaved like, uh,

00:21:40.615,00:21:44.390
like they have to behave
under the Russian occupation.

00:21:44.390,00:21:45.470
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:21:45.470,00:21:48.485
So how many years was--
were you under occupation

00:21:48.485,00:21:50.360
by the Russian forces?

00:21:50.360,00:21:54.800
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, from
1939, from September 1939

00:21:54.800,00:21:59.820
till the outbreak of the
war at the 22nd of June,

00:21:59.820,00:22:03.560
1941 when Hitler
attacked Russia.

00:22:03.560,00:22:04.310
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:22:04.310,00:22:06.729
So that was two years.

00:22:06.729,00:22:08.020
RUBIN PINSKI: Nearly two years.

00:22:08.020,00:22:09.046
SANDY HAYDEN: Right,
nearly two years, yeah.

00:22:09.046,00:22:09.760
RUBIN PINSKI: Two years, yes.

00:22:09.760,00:22:12.218
SANDY HAYDEN: And in a way, it
sounds like your life didn't

00:22:12.218,00:22:13.860
change too much in those tears.

00:22:13.860,00:22:17.490
The everyday living
didn't change too much.

00:22:17.490,00:22:20.925
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, it
did change in, uh, in uh,

00:22:20.925,00:22:24.930
the way that, from one
government to the other,

00:22:24.930,00:22:31.920
which, uh, the Russians had
started to, uh, put in us--

00:22:31.920,00:22:35.450
teach-- teach us-- teach us
their ways that you cannot be

00:22:35.450,00:22:41.325
in the, uh, dealings or any,
uh, you cannot own a store.

00:22:41.325,00:22:44.294
You can-- you can't,
uh, be for your own.

00:22:44.294,00:22:45.960
Everything has to be
for the government.

00:22:45.960,00:22:46.600
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:22:46.600,00:22:48.910
RUBIN PINSKI: Now what you have
to work for the government.

00:22:48.910,00:22:49.660
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:22:49.660,00:22:52.370
So it was more
Marxist or socialist.

00:22:52.370,00:22:53.315
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:22:53.315,00:22:55.130
They tried to teach us.

00:22:55.130,00:22:58.886
But it wasn't so easy to
absorb in the beginning.

00:22:58.886,00:23:01.340
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, so that
was a bit difficult for--

00:23:01.340,00:23:02.640
for all of you.

00:23:02.640,00:23:05.160
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right,
but it was at least safe.

00:23:05.160,00:23:05.910
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:23:05.910,00:23:07.610
And was your father
able to continue

00:23:07.610,00:23:08.872
doing what he had been doing?

00:23:08.872,00:23:09.580
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

00:23:09.580,00:23:10.705
SANDY HAYDEN: What-- what--

00:23:10.705,00:23:13.940
what did he-- what
happened to his work then?

00:23:13.940,00:23:17.480
RUBIN PINSKI: He, uh, he
used to buy, well, not

00:23:17.480,00:23:20.450
exactly the same way as to--

00:23:20.450,00:23:23.830
before used to buy direct
from the farmers and--

00:23:23.830,00:23:24.780
and sell it.

00:23:24.780,00:23:28.000
And here he had to work
for the government.

00:23:28.000,00:23:31.250
He used to buy also
from the farmers,

00:23:31.250,00:23:34.570
but, uh, like in a
cooperative sort of.

00:23:34.570,00:23:38.520
He used to write down
everything he buys

00:23:38.520,00:23:42.150
and, uh, pay out the farmers.

00:23:42.150,00:23:44.120
He worked for the
government, in other words.

00:23:44.120,00:23:45.661
SANDY HAYDEN: And
how-- how was that?

00:23:45.661,00:23:47.327
Was that a big change for him?

00:23:47.327,00:23:48.910
RUBIN PINSKI: He got
used to it first.

00:23:48.910,00:23:50.413
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:23:50.413,00:23:51.840
But it was-- it was all right.

00:23:51.840,00:23:53.464
RUBIN PINSKI: Before
that change, yeah.

00:23:53.464,00:23:54.381
But we got used to it.

00:23:54.381,00:23:55.255
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:23:55.255,00:23:57.080
Did that mean that,
materially, that you

00:23:57.080,00:24:00.330
had less in your family
than you were used to?

00:24:00.330,00:24:03.170
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
uh, a little bit less,

00:24:03.170,00:24:04.880
but it wasn't too bad.

00:24:04.880,00:24:07.062
It was enough to get by.

00:24:07.062,00:24:07.826
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:24:07.826,00:24:10.580
So food, and
clothing, and shoes,

00:24:10.580,00:24:13.050
and all that sort of thing
during the Russian occupation

00:24:13.050,00:24:15.190
wasn't-- was that-- was
not too much of a problem.

00:24:15.190,00:24:16.930
You never--

00:24:16.930,00:24:20.670
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, it was
a problem, because it never

00:24:20.670,00:24:22.170
brought in anything.

00:24:22.170,00:24:22.990
They took away.

00:24:22.990,00:24:23.940
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:24:23.940,00:24:26.010
RUBIN PINSKI: Anything
that was produced,

00:24:26.010,00:24:29.100
they took away from our
town and sent into Russia.

00:24:29.100,00:24:32.770
But, uh, we never
brought anything.

00:24:32.770,00:24:35.660
If they did bring
something, you had

00:24:35.660,00:24:41.120
to stand in, uh, a queue
for-- for hours to get it.

00:24:41.120,00:24:42.860
But we didn't complain.

00:24:42.860,00:24:45.350
It was-- they let us live.

00:24:45.350,00:24:48.440
That was-- that was
the main good thing

00:24:48.440,00:24:49.870
about the Russian occupation.

00:24:49.870,00:24:50.620
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:24:50.620,00:24:54.110
So you were just hoping that
that would continue right

00:24:54.110,00:24:54.727
until--

00:24:54.727,00:24:55.560
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:24:55.560,00:24:58.190
SANDY HAYDEN: But then in 1941--

00:24:58.190,00:25:05.060
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941, when Hitler
attacked, uh, Russia, our city

00:25:05.060,00:25:08.970
was taken by the
Germans officially

00:25:08.970,00:25:12.150
until the 8th of June, 1941.

00:25:12.150,00:25:12.900
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:25:12.900,00:25:16.080
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was eight days later.

00:25:16.080,00:25:20.360
And in the eight
days, the, uh, there

00:25:20.360,00:25:28.265
were some battles close to our
town with the, uh, the, uh,

00:25:28.265,00:25:31.590
Russians who were running
away with the Germans who

00:25:31.590,00:25:38.710
were coming as parachutists.

00:25:38.710,00:25:40.570
The-- actually
they didn't take--

00:25:40.570,00:25:45.130
the Germans didn't occupy
our town as a full army.

00:25:45.130,00:25:51.470
But, uh, the, uh, they
parachuted behind the town

00:25:51.470,00:25:56.830
and attacked all the, uh,
running away trucks and, uh,

00:25:56.830,00:25:58.630
and tanks from the Russian.

00:25:58.630,00:25:59.380
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:25:59.380,00:26:00.389
So there was--

00:26:00.389,00:26:01.430
RUBIN PINSKI: Eight days.

00:26:01.430,00:26:03.930
SANDY HAYDEN: Really, so there
was fighting around your town

00:26:03.930,00:26:04.890
for-- for eight days.

00:26:04.890,00:26:06.806
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah, so
fighting about eight days.

00:26:06.806,00:26:07.681
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:26:07.681,00:26:09.885
And what was it like
during those eight days.

00:26:09.885,00:26:11.664
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
it was very bad.

00:26:11.664,00:26:14.738
The, uh, the Jews,
uh, not only do

00:26:14.738,00:26:17.196
the whole population couldn't
get out of the houses, hiding

00:26:17.196,00:26:18.873
in the houses.

00:26:18.873,00:26:24.400
And they did get out
the, uh, the planes

00:26:24.400,00:26:28.250
shooting over the head,
the German planes.

00:26:28.250,00:26:31.520
In other words, uh,
most people were hiding.

00:26:31.520,00:26:32.270
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:26:32.270,00:26:34.090
And you must-- do you rem--

00:26:34.090,00:26:36.570
I mean, you must have been
very frightened about it.

00:26:36.570,00:26:37.362
RUBIN PINSKI: Very
frightened, yes.

00:26:37.362,00:26:39.112
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you
remember the feeling?

00:26:39.112,00:26:40.660
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
yes, I remember.

00:26:40.660,00:26:43.149
I used to hide even
in the basement.

00:26:43.149,00:26:44.690
SANDY HAYDEN: With
your whole family?

00:26:44.690,00:26:50.290
RUBIN PINSKI: The whole family
for days till-- till the, uh,

00:26:50.290,00:26:54.296
shooting got a little
bit, uh, eased.

00:26:54.296,00:26:55.180
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:26:55.180,00:26:57.462
And during those
eight days, do you--

00:26:57.462,00:26:58.920
I mean, were you
worried about what

00:26:58.920,00:27:01.470
was going to happen now
that the Russians had left?

00:27:01.470,00:27:03.890
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
the uh, we knew

00:27:03.890,00:27:11.360
that it's not so good that
the Germans occupied the, uh,

00:27:11.360,00:27:15.550
living will be, uh,
bad [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:15.550,00:27:16.745
We knew what to expect.

00:27:16.745,00:27:17.870
SANDY HAYDEN: You did know?

00:27:17.870,00:27:18.450
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:27:18.450,00:27:19.450
SANDY HAYDEN: Was this--

00:27:19.450,00:27:22.280
how hard-- how-- how did
you know this information,

00:27:22.280,00:27:23.240
because you--

00:27:23.240,00:27:25.190
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we knew what they do--

00:27:25.190,00:27:27.950
they did in Germany
or in Poland.

00:27:27.950,00:27:31.090
So we knew what to expect.

00:27:31.090,00:27:32.410
And so it happened.

00:27:32.410,00:27:33.160
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:27:33.160,00:27:34.680
Can you-- can you
tell us what happened

00:27:34.680,00:27:35.124
from the time the
Germans occupied?

00:27:35.124,00:27:36.456
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:27:36.456,00:27:40.090
The German soldiers,
they came in the town.

00:27:40.090,00:27:46.140
They-- they were very careful
walking by houses singularly.

00:27:46.140,00:27:50.360
They, uh, first
came in without--

00:27:50.360,00:27:56.910
without, uh, cars, or tanks,
or just occupied the city.

00:27:56.910,00:28:00.595
And, uh, immediately,
they started,

00:28:00.595,00:28:07.530
um, they started to
ask the, uh, some

00:28:07.530,00:28:11.010
of the, uh, Polish or white--

00:28:11.010,00:28:14.520
or the-- or the
non-Jewish population

00:28:14.520,00:28:17.260
where are-- where the Jews are.

00:28:17.260,00:28:22.250
And they asked for food from
the Jews and asked for bicycles.

00:28:22.250,00:28:24.000
SANDY HAYDEN: And you
gave it all to them?

00:28:24.000,00:28:24.305
RUBIN PINSKI: Everything.

00:28:24.305,00:28:25.200
SANDY HAYDEN: They had to, yeah.

00:28:25.200,00:28:26.575
RUBIN PINSKI: They
had no choice.

00:28:26.575,00:28:27.390
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:28:27.390,00:28:29.920
RUBIN PINSKI: And they had--

00:28:29.920,00:28:34.690
right away, the Germans
had some of the, uh,

00:28:34.690,00:28:37.200
of the town's inhabitants.

00:28:37.200,00:28:42.886
Some of them where they
with them, helping them,

00:28:42.886,00:28:47.130
uh, showing them the
Jewish, uh, houses.

00:28:47.130,00:28:53.460
And they went and robbed,
and beat, and uh, and--

00:28:53.460,00:28:59.400
the three days
after the, uh, they

00:28:59.400,00:29:04.140
had already with them
some, um, placards

00:29:04.140,00:29:08.840
hanging out in, uh, three
languages-- in German,

00:29:08.840,00:29:13.980
in Russian, and,
uh, and uh, Polish.

00:29:13.980,00:29:16.878
All de-- decrees against Jews.

00:29:16.878,00:29:17.753
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:29:17.753,00:29:18.700
Yeah.

00:29:18.700,00:29:23.260
RUBIN PINSKI: That the Jews,
uh, cannot walk on the sidewalk.

00:29:23.260,00:29:28.570
They cannot, uh,
possess, uh, fur coats.

00:29:28.570,00:29:33.620
He cannot-- they
cannot have any gold.

00:29:33.620,00:29:36.350
They have to give it
away to the Germans--

00:29:36.350,00:29:41.340
and a long list of
decrees against Jews.

00:29:41.340,00:29:44.690
So we knew right away
the trouble started.

00:29:44.690,00:29:47.400

00:29:47.400,00:29:54.170
And, uh, slowly, the Jews
started to come out of the--

00:29:54.170,00:29:55.450
of the hiding.

00:29:55.450,00:30:06.720
And-- and, uh, the, uh, Germans
gave every day new orders

00:30:06.720,00:30:11.800
to, uh, collect food and
collect clothes for them.

00:30:11.800,00:30:18.080
And then in the, uh, third
week was in July the 5th.

00:30:18.080,00:30:19.920
SANDY HAYDEN: At that
time, had they, um,

00:30:19.920,00:30:22.130
had there been any brutality?

00:30:22.130,00:30:24.320
Had there been-- had
they killed any Jews

00:30:24.320,00:30:25.510
during those three weeks?

00:30:25.510,00:30:27.700
Or had they just beaten them up?

00:30:27.700,00:30:29.630
RUBIN PINSKI: They killed--

00:30:29.630,00:30:34.500
they made like, um,
6 o'clock was curfew.

00:30:34.500,00:30:35.412
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:30:35.412,00:30:37.650
RUBIN PINSKI: And nobody
could go-- get out

00:30:37.650,00:30:41.940
of the house at 6
o'clock in the evening.

00:30:41.940,00:30:43.960
It wasn't evening yet.

00:30:43.960,00:30:50.550
So in several cases, some
Jews walked to one house

00:30:50.550,00:30:51.156
to the other.

00:30:51.156,00:30:52.031
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:30:52.031,00:30:54.320
RUBIN PINSKI: After six of
them got shot right way.

00:30:54.320,00:30:57.060
In other words,
non-Jews weren't shot.

00:30:57.060,00:30:59.950
But Jews are shot
for-- for that.

00:30:59.950,00:31:05.010
That was the-- several
Jews were shot that way.

00:31:05.010,00:31:11.640
But then on the 15th of
July, the, uh, the uh,

00:31:11.640,00:31:13.920
order to make Judenrat.

00:31:13.920,00:31:18.920
In other words, they picked
10 of the best Jews from town

00:31:18.920,00:31:20.010
and--

00:31:20.010,00:31:22.310
and ordered them
to have a Judenrat

00:31:22.310,00:31:26.400
and have a Jewish police.

00:31:26.400,00:31:32.402
And, uh, then the, uh,
the next day, the--

00:31:32.402,00:31:34.860
SANDY HAYDEN: Do you know--
you knew some of the people who

00:31:34.860,00:31:37.225
were elected to the Judenrat?

00:31:37.225,00:31:38.320
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:31:38.320,00:31:44.610
Actually, the best, uh, the
best, uh, people from the city.

00:31:44.610,00:31:49.390
One was a lawyer called Alter
Dvoretsky was a young man.

00:31:49.390,00:31:50.850
He was very capable.

00:31:50.850,00:31:53.970
He was at the head
of the Judenrat

00:31:53.970,00:31:59.987
and, uh, several of
religious Jews [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:59.987,00:32:02.070
SANDY HAYDEN: So they--
they were all good people.

00:32:02.070,00:32:06.170
RUBIN PINSKI: All-- a
better class of people.

00:32:06.170,00:32:08.340
As a matter of fact,
the rabbi for our town

00:32:08.340,00:32:11.220
was also included in that.

00:32:11.220,00:32:16.390
And the men on the
15h of July, it

00:32:16.390,00:32:19.730
was only two weeks
after they occup--

00:32:19.730,00:32:23.920
they came in, they,
uh, sent the police

00:32:23.920,00:32:29.370
to tell all the Jews to
come on the marketplace,

00:32:29.370,00:32:37.110
to get on the market place
from the age of 16 to 60.

00:32:37.110,00:32:41.970
Actually, they said
officially 16 to 60,

00:32:41.970,00:32:44.220
but whenever they
caught younger ones,

00:32:44.220,00:32:47.720
they also pushed
to the marketplace.

00:32:47.720,00:32:50.880
And, uh, on that--

00:32:50.880,00:32:56.350
on that, uh, marketplace,
the Gestapo came in.

00:32:56.350,00:32:59.690
They had a-- a table
and the market chairs.

00:32:59.690,00:33:03.080
And they had a
big list of people

00:33:03.080,00:33:06.550
who they called and said,
anybody will be called out

00:33:06.550,00:33:07.852
should go forward.

00:33:07.852,00:33:09.000
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:33:09.000,00:33:13.160
RUBIN PINSKI: And that way,
they took away 120 people.

00:33:13.160,00:33:13.920
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:33:13.920,00:33:15.306
What sort of people were they?

00:33:15.306,00:33:16.100
All men or--

00:33:16.100,00:33:20.010
RUBIN PINSKI: All men and
the better-- the better

00:33:20.010,00:33:23.122
class of people from the
city, and the-- and the

00:33:23.122,00:33:32.610
uh, the richer and, uh, more
learned, and they packed them

00:33:32.610,00:33:34.415
in talks.

00:33:34.415,00:33:35.790
SANDY HAYDEN: How
do you-- how do

00:33:35.790,00:33:36.998
you think they got that list?

00:33:36.998,00:33:37.980
Who gave them the list?

00:33:37.980,00:33:42.900
RUBIN PINSKI: The, uh, the
list was helped by the, uh,

00:33:42.900,00:33:46.960
local, by local
collaborators to the Germans.

00:33:46.960,00:33:47.880
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:33:47.880,00:33:49.960
Who knew the people in
the-- the Jewish people.

00:33:49.960,00:33:52.030
RUBIN PINSKI: They
knew everybody.

00:33:52.030,00:33:55.560
As a matter of fact,
in [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:55.560,00:33:59.490
in the Hebrew school,
there was a janitor,

00:33:59.490,00:34:03.673
and he could speak Yiddish
just as good as any Jew.

00:34:03.673,00:34:04.440
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:34:04.440,00:34:07.490
RUBIN PINSKI: And he was
right away with the Germans

00:34:07.490,00:34:15.110
and gave out all the Jews
who were, uh, known in the--

00:34:15.110,00:34:15.710
in the town .

00:34:15.710,00:34:18.770

00:34:18.770,00:34:21.860
And, uh, they took--
they said they

00:34:21.860,00:34:28.500
are going to take this, uh, 120
people to work in Nowogrodek.

00:34:28.500,00:34:35.840
Nowogrodek is a bigger city than
us about 38 kilometers away.

00:34:35.840,00:34:40.484
But we found out later that they
were shot in the Nowogrodek.

00:34:40.484,00:34:43.540
SANDY HAYDEN: And when
did you find that out?

00:34:43.540,00:34:46.279
RUBIN PINSKI: Well,
we found out from--

00:34:46.279,00:34:50.460
from peasants, which saw it.

00:34:50.460,00:34:53.730
SANDY HAYDEN: So that was
the first really bad atrocity

00:34:53.730,00:34:54.230
that--

00:34:54.230,00:34:55.190
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:34:55.190,00:35:00.140
That was only two weeks
after they entered our town.

00:35:00.140,00:35:07.090
And, uh, the kids saw all
kinds of, uh, every day they

00:35:07.090,00:35:12.280
demanded from us something
else, the Germans.

00:35:12.280,00:35:21.204
The, uh, or-- we organized
work like there was, uh,

00:35:21.204,00:35:25.380
a highway the Russians
started and didn't finish.

00:35:25.380,00:35:31.460
So they, uh, took
men who could-- well,

00:35:31.460,00:35:34.560
they were a little stronger
to work on that highway.

00:35:34.560,00:35:38.731
And I was also, uh,
working on that highway.

00:35:38.731,00:35:40.730
SANDY HAYDEN: Because
then you were a young man.

00:35:40.730,00:35:41.010
You were 16, 17.

00:35:41.010,00:35:42.960
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
young and strong, and--

00:35:42.960,00:35:43.310
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah.

00:35:43.310,00:35:44.810
RUBIN PINSKI: And
I wanted to leave,

00:35:44.810,00:35:46.960
and they gave out
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:35:46.960,00:35:49.700
[SPEAKING GERMAN] means
some kind of a document.

00:35:49.700,00:35:55.460
There was-- it went
by the column more

00:35:55.460,00:35:59.730
the people who were
stronger hard workers had

00:35:59.730,00:36:00.730
a red [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:36:00.730,00:36:04.250
Some had green
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:36:04.250,00:36:06.610
And, uh, the people--

00:36:06.610,00:36:10.050
the Jews were very,
uh, wanted very

00:36:10.050,00:36:12.074
much to get [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:36:12.074,00:36:12.573
So--

00:36:12.573,00:36:13.360
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:36:13.360,00:36:15.330
So you had-- you had a red one?

00:36:15.330,00:36:16.560
RUBIN PINSKI: I have a good
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, yes.

00:36:16.560,00:36:17.290
SANDY HAYDEN: You
had a good one.

00:36:17.290,00:36:18.350
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:36:18.350,00:36:21.440
SANDY HAYDEN: How were you
chosen to-- to go and work?

00:36:21.440,00:36:24.807
RUBIN PINSKI: I,
uh, actually, they

00:36:24.807,00:36:32.670
were asking for volunteers,
and, uh, I wanted for this job,

00:36:32.670,00:36:34.070
so I worked on the--

00:36:34.070,00:36:36.000
on the, uh, building
that highway.

00:36:36.000,00:36:36.750
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:36:36.750,00:36:38.340
And your brothers?

00:36:38.340,00:36:40.170
RUBIN PINSKI: My
brother wasn't with me.

00:36:40.170,00:36:43.860
He was, uh-- he
was already taken--

00:36:43.860,00:36:48.110
before the at-- the
Germans attacked,

00:36:48.110,00:36:50.005
he was taken to
the Russian Army.

00:36:50.005,00:36:51.630
SANDY HAYDEN: How--
who-- who took him?

00:36:51.630,00:36:54.136
Was he conscripted
to the Russian Army?

00:36:54.136,00:36:55.010
RUBIN PINSKI: No, no.

00:36:55.010,00:36:56.400
He was already of age.

00:36:56.400,00:36:57.030
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh, oh, I see.

00:36:57.030,00:36:58.400
RUBIN PINSKI: He
was born in 19--

00:36:58.400,00:36:59.440
SANDY HAYDEN: So he was in--

00:36:59.440,00:37:00.148
RUBIN PINSKI: 20.

00:37:00.148,00:37:04.430
He was 18 years old,
and he was taken legally

00:37:04.430,00:37:05.382
to the Russian Army.

00:37:05.382,00:37:05.860
SANDY HAYDEN: To
the Russian Army.

00:37:05.860,00:37:06.520
Uh-huh.

00:37:06.520,00:37:09.110
So had you-- did you keep--

00:37:09.110,00:37:11.520
manage to keep correspondence
with him during that time?

00:37:11.520,00:37:13.480
RUBIN PINSKI: It wasn't very--

00:37:13.480,00:37:15.070
it was right before the war.

00:37:15.070,00:37:19.700
All we heard-- we had only one
letter from him that is going

00:37:19.700,00:37:20.210
into--

00:37:20.210,00:37:22.640
deep into Russia.

00:37:22.640,00:37:26.065
And then we were
apart for six years.

00:37:26.065,00:37:26.940
SANDY HAYDEN: Really?

00:37:26.940,00:37:28.773
So you didn't know what
had happened to you.

00:37:28.773,00:37:30.860
RUBIN PINSKI: We
found him in 1946.

00:37:30.860,00:37:32.902
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:37:32.902,00:37:35.360
So that was-- that must have
been very hard for your mother

00:37:35.360,00:37:36.020
and father.

00:37:36.020,00:37:36.952
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes.

00:37:36.952,00:37:37.418
SANDY HAYDEN: It
would be really--

00:37:37.418,00:37:38.820
RUBIN PINSKI: That's right.

00:37:38.820,00:37:39.680
SANDY HAYDEN: And your sister?

00:37:39.680,00:37:40.179
And--

00:37:40.179,00:37:43.950
RUBIN PINSKI: The sister was
the whole time with me together.

00:37:43.950,00:37:45.230
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:37:45.230,00:37:46.570
And then your younger brother.

00:37:46.570,00:37:47.850
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
my younger sister.

00:37:47.850,00:37:49.558
SANDY HAYDEN: Your
younger sister, sorry.

00:37:49.558,00:37:51.590
RUBIN PINSKI: I didn't
tell [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:51.590,00:37:59.170
She perished in, uh, in 1942
in August together the parents.

00:37:59.170,00:38:00.860
SANDY HAYDEN: So your father--

00:38:00.860,00:38:02.320
when the Germans
came, your father

00:38:02.320,00:38:06.257
stopped, um, working, and--

00:38:06.257,00:38:07.090
RUBIN PINSKI: Right.

00:38:07.090,00:38:09.485
SANDY HAYDEN: You were the
only one that was really,

00:38:09.485,00:38:12.447
um, working on the highway.

00:38:12.447,00:38:14.030
RUBIN PINSKI: I was
the only one, yes.

00:38:14.030,00:38:15.540
SANDY HAYDEN: So-- what-- what--

00:38:15.540,00:38:17.270
what were you getting
paid in any way?

00:38:17.270,00:38:17.630
RUBIN PINSKI: No.

00:38:17.630,00:38:17.990
No.

00:38:17.990,00:38:18.380
SANDY HAYDEN: Did they feed you?

00:38:18.380,00:38:20.296
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they
didn't pay us anything.

00:38:20.296,00:38:21.298
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:38:21.298,00:38:24.020
RUBIN PINSKI: Uh, the--

00:38:24.020,00:38:33.830
the, uh, in 1941 on
November, the Germans

00:38:33.830,00:38:38.360
told us to leave our houses
and go into a ghetto.

00:38:38.360,00:38:40.730
They made a ghetto.

00:38:40.730,00:38:44.110
The Jews themselves had to
make a fence, a wired fence,

00:38:44.110,00:38:46.940
around it.

00:38:46.940,00:38:51.590
And at that time, uh, we
could only take with us

00:38:51.590,00:38:52.937
whatever we could--

00:38:52.937,00:38:53.770
SANDY HAYDEN: Carry.

00:38:53.770,00:38:54.603
RUBIN PINSKI: Carry.

00:38:54.603,00:38:55.550
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:38:55.550,00:38:58.620
RUBIN PINSKI: And
it happened that we

00:38:58.620,00:39:02.810
had a big-- a very
big garden and used

00:39:02.810,00:39:07.150
to have enough
potatoes to put it

00:39:07.150,00:39:12.470
in a big hole covered
with earth and hide it

00:39:12.470,00:39:14.120
for the next spring.

00:39:14.120,00:39:17.300
That was done actually
normal times too.

00:39:17.300,00:39:18.620
SANDY HAYDEN: Right.

00:39:18.620,00:39:20.600
RUBIN PINSKI: So we--

00:39:20.600,00:39:28.380
all the potato that we got from,
uh, before the winter came,

00:39:28.380,00:39:30.160
we bur--

00:39:30.160,00:39:33.750
we buried it in the garden.

00:39:33.750,00:39:42.110
And, um, so in Spring
of 1942 in the ghetto,

00:39:42.110,00:39:44.200
I had that chance I--

00:39:44.200,00:39:45.783
to open that hole and--

00:39:45.783,00:39:46.532
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:39:46.532,00:39:49.430
RUBIN PINSKI: --put in the
potatoes in the ghetto so we

00:39:49.430,00:39:50.150
could have--

00:39:50.150,00:39:51.580
SANDY HAYDEN: Some food?

00:39:51.580,00:39:54.050
RUBIN PINSKI: Some
food for a while.

00:39:54.050,00:39:59.160
The whole-- the whole, uh, all
the inhabitants of that house,

00:39:59.160,00:40:00.842
we shared.

00:40:00.842,00:40:08.200
We used to bring in
like, uh, hiding it in--

00:40:08.200,00:40:11.280
in a way that the Germans
shouldn't see that they

00:40:11.280,00:40:12.401
carried potatoes in this--

00:40:12.401,00:40:14.400
SANDY HAYDEN: How did
you-- how did you do that?

00:40:14.400,00:40:17.410
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, we
into the night, at night,

00:40:17.410,00:40:19.120
and brought it in.

00:40:19.120,00:40:22.820
The houses that the
Germans confiscated was--

00:40:22.820,00:40:27.540
in the front of the house
was some sort of, uh--

00:40:27.540,00:40:33.130
uh, a list that,
uh, but this house

00:40:33.130,00:40:34.640
is confiscated by the Germans.

00:40:34.640,00:40:36.960
In the front, they couldn't
get in, but from the back--

00:40:36.960,00:40:37.960
SANDY HAYDEN: You could?

00:40:37.960,00:40:39.690
RUBIN PINSKI:
--you could get in.

00:40:39.690,00:40:40.970
But it didn't do anything.

00:40:40.970,00:40:44.020
A lot of Jewish houses
were occupied by--

00:40:44.020,00:40:48.530
by, uh, local, uh, non-Jews.

00:40:48.530,00:40:49.940
But some of them are still--

00:40:49.940,00:40:51.720
our house was still
empty standing there.

00:40:51.720,00:40:52.470
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:40:52.470,00:40:53.920
So you could sneak in at night.

00:40:53.920,00:40:56.330
RUBIN PINSKI: I used
to sneak in every night

00:40:56.330,00:40:58.450
and bring a little
bit of potatoes

00:40:58.450,00:41:00.080
that I could carry myself.

00:41:00.080,00:41:00.980
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:41:00.980,00:41:02.080
RUBIN PINSKI: And that's--

00:41:02.080,00:41:04.810
that's how we could
live for a while.

00:41:04.810,00:41:07.070
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm And what
were the living conditions

00:41:07.070,00:41:07.990
like in the ghetto?

00:41:07.990,00:41:09.095
RUBIN PINSKI: Very bad.

00:41:09.095,00:41:09.410
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:41:09.410,00:41:11.201
Can you-- can you
describe it a little bit?

00:41:11.201,00:41:15.340
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they
packed in in the house,

00:41:15.340,00:41:20.560
in a little house, about 800
square feet or 900 square feet.

00:41:20.560,00:41:26.067
They packed in about 60 people,
one on top of the other.

00:41:26.067,00:41:28.400
SANDY HAYDEN: And that's how
you and your family lived--

00:41:28.400,00:41:28.940
lived with another--

00:41:28.940,00:41:30.080
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, yes.

00:41:30.080,00:41:31.740
SANDY HAYDEN: --50 people or so.

00:41:31.740,00:41:35.100
RUBIN PINSKI: In the
basement and on top on the--

00:41:35.100,00:41:40.360
under the roof, people,
one on top of the other,

00:41:40.360,00:41:44.490
and the conditions in the
ghetto was very bad, dirty,

00:41:44.490,00:41:46.252
and no food.

00:41:46.252,00:41:47.002
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:41:47.002,00:41:49.180
And-- and lice also.

00:41:49.180,00:41:51.421
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:41:51.421,00:41:53.300
SANDY HAYDEN: And what--
what did the people,

00:41:53.300,00:41:55.730
the leaders of the
ghetto, of the Judenrat,

00:41:55.730,00:41:57.650
were they fair in the way they--

00:41:57.650,00:42:00.495
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, they were
very fair, but they were also--

00:42:00.495,00:42:05.470
they had the same,
uh, goals we did.

00:42:05.470,00:42:08.940
They were also afraid
of-- the Germans used them

00:42:08.940,00:42:11.370
just to get their way.

00:42:11.370,00:42:12.460
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:42:12.460,00:42:17.310
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh, this
out-- this Alter Dvoretsky

00:42:17.310,00:42:20.480
is from the Judenrat.

00:42:20.480,00:42:25.890
He organized a partisan
group in the ghetto.

00:42:25.890,00:42:29.200
And anybody who
could be of help--

00:42:29.200,00:42:31.060
used everybody that
could be of help.

00:42:31.060,00:42:35.210
Only the young
people he mobilized.

00:42:35.210,00:42:40.960
And myself was working in the
highway, building the highway.

00:42:40.960,00:42:46.056
I had a chance to bring into
the ghetto parts, uh, weapons.

00:42:46.056,00:42:47.720
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:42:47.720,00:42:53.402
RUBIN PINSKI: So we used to
tie it in bundles of wood.

00:42:53.402,00:42:54.860
SANDY HAYDEN: So
they wouldn't see.

00:42:54.860,00:42:58.242
RUBIN PINSKI: To carry it in.

00:42:58.242,00:43:01.940
And, uh, I used to take
chances to bring in parts

00:43:01.940,00:43:06.484
of rifles and ammunition.

00:43:06.484,00:43:11.140
And from time to time,
the Germans used to check

00:43:11.140,00:43:12.380
everybody-- every bundle of--

00:43:12.380,00:43:13.171
SANDY HAYDEN: Wood?

00:43:13.171,00:43:16.265
RUBIN PINSKI: Of wood,
or on the person.

00:43:16.265,00:43:19.359
Anybody that was found with
something was shot right away.

00:43:19.359,00:43:21.150
SANDY HAYDEN: So you
were lucky you never--

00:43:21.150,00:43:21.870
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I was lucky.

00:43:21.870,00:43:22.610
SANDY HAYDEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:22.610,00:43:24.276
It must have been
frightening each time.

00:43:24.276,00:43:25.680
RUBIN PINSKI: Oh, yes, I mean--

00:43:25.680,00:43:26.440
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, it's a risk.

00:43:26.440,00:43:28.686
RUBIN PINSKI: I risked
with my life all the time.

00:43:28.686,00:43:29.892
SANDY HAYDEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:29.892,00:43:31.850
So you joined the partisan
group in the ghetto.

00:43:31.850,00:43:33.250
RUBIN PINSKI: Yeah.

00:43:33.250,00:43:33.869
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:33.869,00:43:34.660
SANDY HAYDEN: 194--

00:43:34.660,00:43:35.590
1941?

00:43:35.590,00:43:36.714
RUBIN PINSKI: 1941.

00:43:36.714,00:43:37.588
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

00:43:37.588,00:43:40.420
RUBIN PINSKI: We organized the--

00:43:40.420,00:43:44.975
in the basement, we used
to put together the rifles.

00:43:44.975,00:43:46.100
SANDY HAYDEN: And did you--

00:43:46.100,00:43:47.296
did you use them?

00:43:47.296,00:43:48.230
What-- what-- what--

00:43:48.230,00:43:50.936
RUBIN PINSKI: No, I didn't
have a chance to use,

00:43:50.936,00:43:54.750
and practically, nobody
had a chance, only--

00:43:54.750,00:44:00.170
only a few young
boys, uh, were, uh,

00:44:00.170,00:44:03.449
fighting against
them in the second--

00:44:03.449,00:44:07.910
not in the second time when
the Germans killed the Jews.

00:44:07.910,00:44:12.346
The Germans killed,
uh, about half

00:44:12.346,00:44:13.970
of the Jewish population
in the ghettos

00:44:13.970,00:44:18.600
they killed in 1941
till the end of April.

00:44:18.600,00:44:20.000
SANDY HAYDEN:
Yeah, I-- can you--

00:44:20.000,00:44:20.750
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes.

00:44:20.750,00:44:21.685
SANDY HAYDEN: Can you tell
me a little bit about--

00:44:21.685,00:44:23.268
RUBIN PINSKI: That
was a very bad day.

00:44:23.268,00:44:26.060
Then my parents were--

00:44:26.060,00:44:29.770
got killed killed and my sister.

00:44:29.770,00:44:36.380
Uh, it was the 30th of
April, 1941, and the Germans,

00:44:36.380,00:44:41.786
with the help [INAUDIBLE]
of the Ukrainian police,

00:44:41.786,00:44:49.100
so there were a few white
Russian police also surrounded

00:44:49.100,00:44:50.560
the ghetto.

00:44:50.560,00:44:54.504
And, uh, very early in the
morning, about 5 o'clock

00:44:54.504,00:44:56.670
in the morning, they started
to knock on the windows

00:44:56.670,00:45:01.310
and scream [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:45:01.310,00:45:04.655
And, uh, they told
us to gather in

00:45:04.655,00:45:08.460
that, uh, it was an old cem--

00:45:08.460,00:45:11.510
Jewish cemetery
near the, uh, the

00:45:11.510,00:45:15.620
synagogues and told
us to gather there,

00:45:15.620,00:45:17.570
all the Jews should together.

00:45:17.570,00:45:20.900
And I came there.

00:45:20.900,00:45:27.230
We, uh-- they told us to
stand in families, each family

00:45:27.230,00:45:29.540
together, all the families.

00:45:29.540,00:45:32.720
So I had that red
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,

00:45:32.720,00:45:36.810
which was considered
to be a good sign.

00:45:36.810,00:45:41.750
And I had a friend who also
had a good [SPEAKING GERMAN],,

00:45:41.750,00:45:46.010
so I told him to take
my sister, saying

00:45:46.010,00:45:49.920
that this wife and I wanted
to rescue my family, my father

00:45:49.920,00:45:53.055
and mother.

00:45:53.055,00:46:00.150
I remember they started to
select the, uh, I showed him

00:46:00.150,00:46:01.170
the [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:46:01.170,00:46:07.090
So he said, [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
to the right, which was good.

00:46:07.090,00:46:14.120
And right after, a couple
steps from this Gestapo man,

00:46:14.120,00:46:18.470
stood other Gestapo
people, looked

00:46:18.470,00:46:22.460
at the [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
and they let me go through

00:46:22.460,00:46:26.225
and apparently chased
[SPEAKING GERMAN],,

00:46:26.225,00:46:27.830
in other words--

00:46:27.830,00:46:29.450
SANDY HAYDEN: To--
to the bad line.

00:46:29.450,00:46:31.705
RUBIN PINSKI: To--
to get killed.

00:46:31.705,00:46:37.490
They said to resettle for
labor or something else,

00:46:37.490,00:46:39.761
but they took them
behind the town.

00:46:39.761,00:46:42.010
SANDY HAYDEN: And there was
nothing that you could do.

00:46:42.010,00:46:43.630
RUBIN PINSKI:
Nothing I could do.

00:46:43.630,00:46:47.260
And my sister went
with that, uh,

00:46:47.260,00:46:50.920
my friend who had a good
[SPEAKING GERMAN] too,

00:46:50.920,00:46:54.902
and she was, uh, rescued.

00:46:54.902,00:46:55.860
SANDY HAYDEN: Is that--

00:46:55.860,00:46:58.068
that day must be a very hard
day for you to remember.

00:46:58.068,00:47:00.450
RUBIN PINSKI: A
very bad day, yeah.

00:47:00.450,00:47:05.530
They killed half of the
Jewish population in one day,

00:47:05.530,00:47:08.990
and then they
shortened the ghetto.

00:47:08.990,00:47:12.750
They cut it in half.

00:47:12.750,00:47:18.784
In other words, the, uh, all
the edges around the ghetto,

00:47:18.784,00:47:21.520
and they told the Jews--

00:47:21.520,00:47:28.356
for the Jews to put an
electric fence closer inside.

00:47:28.356,00:47:31.760
And I continued to
work on that highway.

00:47:31.760,00:47:33.770
SANDY HAYDEN:
And-- and the Jews,

00:47:33.770,00:47:37.180
your family and the other
Jews, were they taken?

00:47:37.180,00:47:38.340
What happened to them?

00:47:38.340,00:47:39.804
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
they were taken.

00:47:39.804,00:47:41.220
They were led
through the streets.

00:47:41.220,00:47:48.910
They were taken behind the
town, and forced to undress,

00:47:48.910,00:47:54.150
and the, uh, the graves
were already dug.

00:47:54.150,00:47:58.570
It was already ready,
and they shot 50 people

00:47:58.570,00:48:01.055
at a time right--

00:48:01.055,00:48:05.095
right on top of the cliff.

00:48:05.095,00:48:06.602
They were all killed.

00:48:06.602,00:48:08.560
SANDY HAYDEN: What went
through your mind then?

00:48:08.560,00:48:10.910
Did you feel like you wanted
to avenge their deaths?

00:48:10.910,00:48:12.640
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that's the only thing

00:48:12.640,00:48:15.820
was in my mind to avenge.

00:48:15.820,00:48:18.800
Well, I never believed
I'll stay alive.

00:48:18.800,00:48:22.950
But at least I should be
able to avenge for the--

00:48:22.950,00:48:25.110
for what they did.

00:48:25.110,00:48:26.314
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:48:26.314,00:48:28.480
Something that-- has that
stayed-- the feeling of it

00:48:28.480,00:48:29.146
stayed with you?

00:48:29.146,00:48:30.550
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes, I still--

00:48:30.550,00:48:34.550
the feeling never changed.

00:48:34.550,00:48:41.420
Well, I can't feel exactly the
same as I felt then, but I, uh,

00:48:41.420,00:48:44.220
had that feeling all the time.

00:48:44.220,00:48:48.410
SANDY HAYDEN: And-- and so
what happened after that day?

00:48:48.410,00:48:52.594
RUBIN PINSKI: Well, the, uh,
the ghetto was shortened.

00:48:52.594,00:48:57.130
The Judenrat actually
was also killed.

00:48:57.130,00:49:00.490
They told to the Judenrat.

00:49:00.490,00:49:03.350

00:49:03.350,00:49:10.650
And, uh, they kept us
alive till August--

00:49:10.650,00:49:17.700
August 6th, 1942,
and, uh, August 6th ,

00:49:17.700,00:49:21.690
1942 happened the same thing.

00:49:21.690,00:49:27.230
The-- the Germans and
the Ukrainian police

00:49:27.230,00:49:31.820
surrounded-- surrounded
the, uh, the ghetto

00:49:31.820,00:49:35.180
and chased everybody
out in the marketplace.

00:49:35.180,00:49:38.235
But, uh, at that
time, I didn't--

00:49:38.235,00:49:40.800
I didn't run anymore to the--

00:49:40.800,00:49:43.990
on the marketplace
we were hiding.

00:49:43.990,00:49:44.740
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:49:44.740,00:49:45.680
Who-- who is we?

00:49:45.680,00:49:46.180
You?

00:49:46.180,00:49:47.013
You and your sister.

00:49:47.013,00:49:51.030
RUBIN PINSKI: I, and my
sister, and my cousin,

00:49:51.030,00:49:53.310
two cousins of mine.

00:49:53.310,00:49:56.675
We were hiding in a--

00:49:56.675,00:50:03.190
we-- we actually dug a
hiding place under the floor.

00:50:03.190,00:50:10.310
But being so close to the, uh,
ghetto gate of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:10.310,00:50:14.710
was the Germans where, the
other side of the ghetto, they

00:50:14.710,00:50:20.444
had their, uh, the officers.

00:50:20.444,00:50:23.350
We were afraid that close--

00:50:23.350,00:50:24.840
close-- being
close to the ghetto

00:50:24.840,00:50:29.305
would be a lot worse if
they start digging with

00:50:29.305,00:50:33.900
or searching with, uh, dogs.

00:50:33.900,00:50:36.590
So we were running--

00:50:36.590,00:50:39.300
we were running in a
place where my cousin

00:50:39.300,00:50:43.680
was working as a carpenter.

00:50:43.680,00:50:49.950
And the-- the-- it
was inside the ghetto.

00:50:49.950,00:50:53.270
You could get in from inside
and from outside the ghetto.

00:50:53.270,00:50:58.720
The, uh-- in other words,
the, uh, there was--

00:50:58.720,00:51:01.010
the back of the building
was inside the ghetto.

00:51:01.010,00:51:04.170
The front of the building
was out of the ghetto.

00:51:04.170,00:51:07.950
So we were running there
and running-- and hiding

00:51:07.950,00:51:08.650
in the basement.

00:51:08.650,00:51:13.140
There wasn't a
dark place to hide,

00:51:13.140,00:51:18.510
but a plain, little basement
and a tiny, little window.

00:51:18.510,00:51:24.240
And we got into the basement
and about 15 people there.

00:51:24.240,00:51:27.920
Some came also running
at that the place.

00:51:27.920,00:51:32.690
We are hiding there a whole day,
and through the little window,

00:51:32.690,00:51:34.350
you could see that--

00:51:34.350,00:51:40.150
the way the Germans chased
the Jews to the marketplace

00:51:40.150,00:51:43.260
and beating them.

00:51:43.260,00:51:50.753
And, uh, towards evening, at
night, we tried to get to--

00:51:50.753,00:51:54.430
we tried to get out of there,
because we knew we cannot stay

00:51:54.430,00:51:57.570
there overnight.

00:51:57.570,00:52:02.735
And, uh, somehow everybody
wants to get out first

00:52:02.735,00:52:07.962
and started to commotion
inside when the,

00:52:07.962,00:52:14.010
uh, the Germans with the
Lithuanians and the Ukrainians

00:52:14.010,00:52:20.590
were all helping the Germans,
uh, in the gathering the Jews.

00:52:20.590,00:52:23.682
They heard noise
in the building.

00:52:23.682,00:52:29.390
And they, uh, first opened
the door, and they caught us.

00:52:29.390,00:52:32.630
And, uh, my cousin
was a carpenter and I

00:52:32.630,00:52:36.820
started to beg the Germans as--

00:52:36.820,00:52:38.036
let us live.

00:52:38.036,00:52:40.210
I-- I could carpent--

00:52:40.210,00:52:42.310
I can.

00:52:42.310,00:52:46.240
So the German
answered, yeah, yeah.

00:52:46.240,00:52:50.412
Tomorrow, we will take
you to the new house.

00:52:50.412,00:52:53.405
In other words, we knew that
they were going to shoot us.

00:52:53.405,00:52:57.800
And they pushed us in
back into the basement

00:52:57.800,00:53:01.270
and put a heavy
table on top of it.

00:53:01.270,00:53:09.830
And, uh, outside they put
a post working, watching,

00:53:09.830,00:53:15.800
watching the uh, the outside
in the little window.

00:53:15.800,00:53:19.580
But to our-- to
our luck, the posts

00:53:19.580,00:53:24.250
sat down close to the
window and fell asleep.

00:53:24.250,00:53:27.650
And the, uh, the window
was too small for anybody

00:53:27.650,00:53:30.290
to get-- to crawl through.

00:53:30.290,00:53:34.980
So we-- we stretched out all
the cement around the window

00:53:34.980,00:53:41.850
and made a bigger hole, and
slowly, we took out the shoes,

00:53:41.850,00:53:42.950
and slowly we--

00:53:42.950,00:53:44.270
SANDY HAYDEN: Escaped, yeah.

00:53:44.270,00:53:48.530
RUBIN PINSKI: We, uh,
called out, and we, uh,

00:53:48.530,00:53:49.707
said that we'll--

00:53:49.707,00:53:53.780
we'll meet right in, uh, that.

00:53:53.780,00:53:57.470
A little river was
running close by,

00:53:57.470,00:54:02.310
and we said we shouldn't
walk with the streets.

00:54:02.310,00:54:05.780
We should, uh, go with the
river, which takes us out

00:54:05.780,00:54:08.930
in the outskirts of
the-- of the town.

00:54:08.930,00:54:10.492
And that way, we--

00:54:10.492,00:54:12.310
SANDY HAYDEN: So
you all escaped.

00:54:12.310,00:54:14.320
RUBIN PINSKI: Not all.

00:54:14.320,00:54:17.760
An older woman couldn't make it.

00:54:17.760,00:54:21.920
Two-- two people still, because
they found only two people

00:54:21.920,00:54:22.520
there in the--

00:54:22.520,00:54:23.936
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.
in the morning.

00:54:23.936,00:54:27.350
RUBIN PINSKI: --in the
basement the next day.

00:54:27.350,00:54:35.740
They escaped, and we wandered
around for, um, for, um,

00:54:35.740,00:54:36.680
until--

00:54:36.680,00:54:41.040
until it got, uh, light.

00:54:41.040,00:54:44.695
They escaped, my sister,
and I, and my two cousins

00:54:44.695,00:54:51.340
were running together, and
they came not very far.

00:54:51.340,00:54:55.400
They ran away about 10
kilometers out of town.

00:54:55.400,00:54:58.360
And it was already light.

00:54:58.360,00:55:03.590
We couldn't walk any further,
so we were hiding a little--

00:55:03.590,00:55:06.408
the little forest was very--

00:55:06.408,00:55:09.880
it wasn't-- it was a very
dangerous place to stay.

00:55:09.880,00:55:12.630
But we crawled into a bush.

00:55:12.630,00:55:14.860
We were hiding there.

00:55:14.860,00:55:17.080
And the shepherds could--

00:55:17.080,00:55:21.580
uh, we could see the
shepherds in the morning.

00:55:21.580,00:55:26.290
And somehow, we are lucky
that nobody noticed us

00:55:26.290,00:55:28.770
the whole day.

00:55:28.770,00:55:34.540
So the next evening,
we were trying

00:55:34.540,00:55:40.900
to get food into the
forest, because the, uh,

00:55:40.900,00:55:46.205
the forest around our
town was only about,

00:55:46.205,00:55:50.029
uh, 4 to 20 kilometers away.

00:55:50.029,00:55:52.570
SANDY HAYDEN: Were you planning
then to join partisan groups?

00:55:52.570,00:55:54.480
RUBIN PINSKI: Yes,
that was the main idea,

00:55:54.480,00:55:56.610
to join the partisans.

00:55:56.610,00:56:04.720
And, uh, the next night, we
came towards the, uh, forest

00:56:04.720,00:56:07.150
where the partisans were.

00:56:07.150,00:56:14.110
But talking to a peasant,
we knocked on the door,

00:56:14.110,00:56:17.230
and eh opened the door
to us, and he said--

00:56:17.230,00:56:23.930
he gave us bad news that
the Russian partisans are--

00:56:23.930,00:56:29.480
they are anti-Semitic, and they
killed some Jewish partisans,

00:56:29.480,00:56:33.040
which was the leader,
Alter Dvoretsky.

00:56:33.040,00:56:41.950
He was killed, and he suggested
we should go into, uh,

00:56:41.950,00:56:45.422
there was a [SPEAKING GERMAN]
like a working--

00:56:45.422,00:56:51.160
uh, it was a camp, which
was about 30 kilometers

00:56:51.160,00:56:55.930
from our town, and the town
was called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:55.930,00:57:01.150
And, uh, there the Germans
need these people, the Jews,

00:57:01.150,00:57:04.330
to build for them an airport.

00:57:04.330,00:57:10.720
And it was a chance to stay
alive as that farmer suggested.

00:57:10.720,00:57:14.260
And we took his advice, and
we went towards that, uh,

00:57:14.260,00:57:18.220
camp, which was--

00:57:18.220,00:57:21.850
together was about 33
kilometers to make.

00:57:21.850,00:57:27.490
So to the next,
towards [INAUDIBLE],,

00:57:27.490,00:57:34.390
we went around our town
towards that, uh, camp.

00:57:34.390,00:57:38.381
And the next morning,
we came-- we came--

00:57:38.381,00:57:40.210
we finally came to that camp.

00:57:40.210,00:57:42.410
We joined a group
of Jewish workers,

00:57:42.410,00:57:45.560
and we got into that camp.

00:57:45.560,00:57:48.640
Our feet were swollen,
because we were always

00:57:48.640,00:57:50.710
walking barefoot.

00:57:50.710,00:57:51.970
SANDY HAYDEN: And hungry.

00:57:51.970,00:57:53.890
RUBIN PINSKI: And hungry.

00:57:53.890,00:57:57.310
But the conditions in that
camp was just terrible.

00:57:57.310,00:57:58.780
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:57:58.780,00:58:00.880
RUBIN PINSKI: It was summer.

00:58:00.880,00:58:03.100
People slept under the sky.

00:58:03.100,00:58:04.870
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:58:04.870,00:58:08.970
RUBIN PINSKI: And, uh,
there was very little food.

00:58:08.970,00:58:13.210
And people had to carry stones
from one place to the other

00:58:13.210,00:58:14.026
to--

00:58:14.026,00:58:18.775
to, uh, build that airport.

00:58:18.775,00:58:25.829
And, uh, the, uh, we couldn't
work here, because we--

00:58:25.829,00:58:26.620
our feet were all--

00:58:26.620,00:58:27.578
SANDY HAYDEN: Was sore.

00:58:27.578,00:58:29.620
RUBIN PINSKI: --were
beaten and swollen.

00:58:29.620,00:58:33.075
So but they forced
us to go to work.

00:58:33.075,00:58:36.280
SANDY HAYDEN: Who-- were these
not Germans again or Russians?

00:58:36.280,00:58:37.100
Who?

00:58:37.100,00:58:40.630
RUBIN PINSKI: No,
the, uh, the people

00:58:40.630,00:58:43.950
who watched us were
actually Ukrainians.

00:58:43.950,00:58:46.510
And there were Jewish police.

00:58:46.510,00:58:52.660
The Germans always had this
streak to-- the-- to have

00:58:52.660,00:58:53.410
their--

00:58:53.410,00:58:56.545
their own-- their
own people to--

00:58:56.545,00:58:58.990
to do the bad job.

00:58:58.990,00:59:04.160
So the Jewish police would
chase down the Jews to work.

00:59:04.160,00:59:05.440
Actually, they had to.

00:59:05.440,00:59:06.353
They had no choice.

00:59:06.353,00:59:07.103
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

00:59:07.103,00:59:08.410
So you-- you--

00:59:08.410,00:59:11.820
you are sympathetic to their
position, the Jewish police.

00:59:11.820,00:59:14.376
You don't feel any--

00:59:14.376,00:59:16.970
RUBIN PINSKI: No, they didn't
do anything that they could help

00:59:16.970,00:59:17.470
it .

00:59:17.470,00:59:19.520
A lot of them were
actually in the partisans,

00:59:19.520,00:59:21.580
were running away to
the partisans together.

00:59:21.580,00:59:26.056
But, uh, they had no choice.

00:59:26.056,00:59:28.730
They were appointed
by the Germans,

00:59:28.730,00:59:33.220
and they to do what the
Germans told them to do.

00:59:33.220,00:59:38.240
And, uh, finally by--

00:59:38.240,00:59:41.520
by being there about
three weeks, we did--

00:59:41.520,00:59:43.310
I, for example, had to--

00:59:43.310,00:59:49.160
was chased out to go to work
on the carrying the stones.

00:59:49.160,00:59:53.380
And I was looking for a way
to go back to the partisans

00:59:53.380,00:59:54.440
till I--

00:59:54.440,00:59:56.330
one day, I found--

00:59:56.330,01:00:01.155
I noticed someone who I
knew went to the forest

01:00:01.155,01:00:06.260
yet before the slaughter
of the Jews in our town.

01:00:06.260,01:00:11.870
And when I talked to
him, and we met up,

01:00:11.870,01:00:14.840
they said that he
came to pick up Jews

01:00:14.840,01:00:20.590
from this camp to the forest.

01:00:20.590,01:00:23.995
And he gave me a
[INAUDIBLE],, a map how to--

01:00:23.995,01:00:25.120
SANDY HAYDEN: To get there.

01:00:25.120,01:00:26.630
RUBIN PINSKI: Go around.

01:00:26.630,01:00:34.570
Not to go to villages or to, uh,
in other words, to be careful

01:00:34.570,01:00:40.420
not to fall into certain,
uh, certain peasants who

01:00:40.420,01:00:42.995
helped the Germans.

01:00:42.995,01:00:49.560
And, uh, and, uh,
one-- one evening,

01:00:49.560,01:00:52.000
instead of going back to the--

01:00:52.000,01:00:53.920
the ghetto, there
was also a ghetto

01:00:53.920,01:00:59.246
in that camp, sort of a
ghetto, I stayed behind a--

01:00:59.246,01:01:02.770
a hump of stones.

01:01:02.770,01:01:07.940
And, uh, we left that camp.

01:01:07.940,01:01:09.940
SANDY HAYDEN: You, and
your sister, and cousins.

01:01:09.940,01:01:11.860
RUBIN PINSKI: My sister
and my two cousins.

01:01:11.860,01:01:12.910
SANDY HAYDEN: Uh-huh.

01:01:12.910,01:01:17.270
RUBIN PINSKI: And
another two, six of us,

01:01:17.270,01:01:21.390
and we made it during
the night to the forest.

01:01:21.390,01:01:22.540
SANDY HAYDEN: Mhm.

01:01:22.540,01:01:25.650
Well, I think we finished
the first half of the tape.

01:01:25.650,01:01:26.150
So--

01:01:26.150,01:01:26.940
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

01:01:26.940,01:01:27.910
SANDY HAYDEN: They are going
to rewind it and then--

01:01:27.910,01:01:28.620
RUBIN PINSKI: OK.

01:01:28.620,01:01:30.517
SANDY HAYDEN: --we
can start from the--

01:01:30.517,01:01:32.350
RUBIN PINSKI: OK, in
the [INAUDIBLE] forest.

01:01:32.350,01:01:34.500
SANDY HAYDEN: In a
few minutes, yeah.

01:01:34.500,01:01:39.268
