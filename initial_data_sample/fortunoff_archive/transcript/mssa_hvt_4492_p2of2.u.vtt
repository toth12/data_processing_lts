00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:90%
--tapes.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.068 align:middle line:90%
And it made it more difficult.

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And we are rolling.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So we were just discussing
the interviewer methodology.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And I-- if you're willing,
and you don't have to--

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to comment, you
said that you used

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
to do five to seven
testimonies in one day, which

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:90%
to me is mind-boggling.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:90%
I can't imagine doing that.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine
the mental stamina

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and the physical
stamina it takes.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And you said you swam to
kind of relieve yourself.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And you talked a little bit
about protective amnesia.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, you
were so immersed in it.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And also, five days
a week, working

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
as a psychiatrist, as-- as an
interviewer and as a survivor,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
yourself, how did that
impact the process for you?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And do you think that,
in general, survivors

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.864 align:middle line:90%
should be interviewers?

00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Should be interviewed?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Should be interviewers?

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.445 align:middle line:84%
If I take myself as
a model, then, yes.

00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, their own experience
is alive and awakened.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
I think that part--

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
exans-- an example of that
is my interview of my mother,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that she spoke of experiences
that I was part of.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.475 align:middle line:90%
And they were the same.

00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Or they were
different, sometimes.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was, uh, moments
in which I pointed out

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
the difference and
moments I kept silent,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.948 align:middle line:84%
because she needed it to
tell it the way she told it.

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Uh, I think the survivor
herself knows whether she

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:90%
could be an interviewer or not.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, if it take-- there
may be people for whom this is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:90%
so, uh, upsetting, so--

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
uh, such-- causes such
an emotional storm,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that they shouldn't
be interviewer.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.076 align:middle line:90%
But they will know it.

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And they will know it,
at least till they try.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.975 align:middle line:84%
And they know what-- they
find out that they do it.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It's-- I have a
lifelong training,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
how to involve myself and
come back to m-- to the orig--

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
my original self, so.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And be completely
there, yet return.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Does it take a toll?

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Will I need to swim after this?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.472 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:32.938 align:middle line:90%
And I probably will go swimming.

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Uh.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there any alternative
way to do it?

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And I say this with
qualifications-- no.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to be all the
way there and to live it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.615 align:middle line:84%
and to struggle with
it and to feel it.

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's terrifying
in order to make it--

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:90%
make it come into being.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:90%
You can stop faking.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:90%
No faking here.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Um.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So if survivors were--
are able to live a life,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:90%
they're also able to have an--

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
to do an interview and to,
uh, be in-- into themselves

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
and into the experience
they are sharing,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
they are h-- they are
hearing, and the-- the impact

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.996 align:middle line:90%
that the one has on the other.

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Um.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Do, uh, particular
situations stir me up more?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, uh,
particularly when

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
there's terror
involved, when, uh,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
German uniforms are present.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
empty uniform,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with, uh,
the soldiers inside.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my own
moments of terror in that.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
And, uh, maybe that's how I can.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
The-- the person
interviewed feels

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
better understood
and better, um,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
touched if they sensed that
they elicit something in me.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
So, uh, do I pay a price for it?

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I pay a price for it.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- I have to
bring myself back to--

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
What is terribly
important is that you--

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
interviewer feels
loved, that he's not--

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
not alone.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, I was very
fortunate in that way.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I felt loved as a child and
also throughout my life.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Um.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, I'm free
associating, and that's OK.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that here is how
I married [? Johanna, ?]

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
who was able to not only cross
an ocean but cross a religion,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
cross an experience, and
became an observant Jew.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way of
loving and being with me.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, that was
enormously empowering.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Uh.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's, uh, the
interviewed's relationship

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:90%
but stemming from a--

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
a relatedness of the
interviewer, who can offer it.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.682 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.682 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Um.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think it continues
to be a relationship

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:90%
after the interview is over.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And I found that, when
I re-interviewed people,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that we were-- there was a very
strong connection between us,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.815 align:middle line:84%
although we hadn't
spoken for decades.

00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.684 align:middle line:84%
Even, it was embarrassing that
I'd forgotten who they were.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And, uh--

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:90%
But not the reverse?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Pardon?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:90%
But not the reverse?

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:90%
But not the reverse.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, I-- in some case,
I'd forgotten [INAUDIBLE] part

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
of their story.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But in others, I remembered
their story, very vividly.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are
psychological factors

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
why there is more forgetting
or less forgetting.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you did
these re-interviews,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:84%
you didn't watch
the first testimony

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
before you went in to
do the re-interview?

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do that, no.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to rely on
what I remembered.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was for another
project, not for us.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:84%
That was for another
project for--

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
uh, funded by the Slave Labor--

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But when we did the
re-interviews here,

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.304 align:middle line:84%
we did watch the
first testimonies.

00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you remember that.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I remember, vaguely, yes.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.581 align:middle line:84%
And, um, you know, that
was part of our protocol--

00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.156 align:middle line:90%
--in doing those re-interviews.

00:08:12.156 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Um.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the-- the whole
development of this methodology

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and the way you think about it
and the influence you've had,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
um, and contrasting
it with others, it--

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.708 align:middle line:90%
I think it's, um--

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use
the word "risky,"

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a lot
more confidence--

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
--to do what you do
and to do what we do,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.560 align:middle line:84%
than it does to go in
with a set of questions.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm wondering-- and--

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's risky to do what we
do, because we expose ourselves

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to the potential of
hearing terrible--

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I-- I-- there isn't words.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
There aren't words to describe
some of the experiences

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that we've heard.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But with a questionnaire,
you control that.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.751 align:middle line:90%
So it's much less risky.

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you think that, in
spite of that questionnaire,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:90%
people can share those memories?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the
questionnaire is a buffer

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and probably
reduces the sharing.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Except that there is a
internal pressure to tell

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and a yearning to be heard.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:43.062 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, now, interviews,
simply making this available.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It wa-- the child was born.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It came out with
some help, sometimes.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, in spite
of the questionnaire,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:10:01.995 align:middle line:84%
people will speak and
say what is pressuring,

00:10:01.995 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:90%
because it's a relief.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's this--
this yearning.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And whether-- at
least, they can--

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
for them, there can
be an imaginary, uh,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
listener behind
that piece of paper,

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.636 align:middle line:90%
that page with the questions.

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:21.174 align:middle line:84%
Um, it's bo-- also likely that
the interviewer will interfere.

00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's enough that you show
that you don't want to hear,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:90%
and then it's all--

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
there's no story--
there's no testimony.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it-- it's
a wide spectrum.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
In some situations, yes, the--
something will come through.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
In others, it will
be chopped off.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there's any
difference between those early

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
testimonies, that were taken
in the '70s and '80s, only--

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying "only"--

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:84%
30-something to
40-something years

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
after the experience,
and the later ones,

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that you did re-interviews of--
of people who are now 60 and 70

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:90%
years from this experience?

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.748 align:middle line:84%
I-- I think the
time li-- time is--

00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
uh, I don't think there's
a difference between '70s

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and '80s and the--
the later ones.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
There could be a difference
between '45, '47,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and the later ones.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've a little--
uh, uh-- studied them,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:90%
both their interviews.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.415 align:middle line:84%
And they have much more
a quality of immediacy

00:11:42.415 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and of an appeal.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a message of
this-- the "shtetl brennt,"

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to tell that maybe
some help will come in.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not yet over.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Uh, even, still rescue and
change the course of history.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a quality of the
immediate interview.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
My daughters were taken
away, sent to Auschwitz.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.171 align:middle line:90%
But are they dead?

00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:90%
The question mark.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So those early
interviews are a--

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
have a quality of a cry for
help and for intervention.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the later
one, it's clear

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.724 align:middle line:90%
that the daughter is dead.

00:12:19.724 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And how does one deal with a
memory and the last moments?

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, there's
work that has been

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
done, in the-- in the
interim, by the survivor.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But I do not know that there's
a difference between the 1970s,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:90%
'80s, and later on.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I-- what I can say
about the interviews,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that when I
re-interviewed people,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Leon's interview, the
first time, is one hour.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The second time is
two and a half hours.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was because you
only had one hour of tape.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.971 align:middle line:90%
We had 20-minutes tape then.

00:12:58.971 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Tape.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But, you-- you know, it
was very limited, by the--

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:90%
It was limited.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And so but who is the cause?

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I think, it's also our
ways-- way of interview,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:90%
of knowing how to interview.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a com-- very
more differentiated story,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that he was not only
a-- the thief of bread

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:90%
but the bread bringer.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:84%
He worked in a bakery and
brought her, uh, bread, each--

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and he used to extract the
bread through the window.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And then there were grates,
so it was two sticks.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
That this cut up
the bread next time.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So he enourished his family, not
only took bread to his family,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%
nourished.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:90%
This was a very different.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So the first memory was like a
cover memory, a screen memory--

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
--that didn't tell
the full memory.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.855 align:middle line:90%
But is it Leon who has in--

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:49.390 align:middle line:84%
uh, integrated more,
knows more with age,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
or is it our interviewing that
was different 25 years later?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:84%
That's very interesting to me,
because, when we were doing

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
our re-interview project,
which was quite a bit earlier--

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
it was in the early to
mid-'90s-- and we asked Leon.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.371 align:middle line:90%
He said no.

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:07.870 align:middle line:90%
He what?

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:90%
He said?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:90%
He said no.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
be interviewed?

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't be re-interviewed.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, we asked all
four of those original.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And two said yes,
and two said no.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And Leon said no.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.021 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I'm just wondering
about the passage of time.

00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, you are raising
questions that I

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:84%
think should be studied in a
methodological, rigorous way.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I don't
see that study happening.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe having the testimonies,
it will happen one day.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
You asked me one thing
that I-- that I regretted,

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
that there's not
much more sub-facets

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:90%
studied of the testimonies.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And there is--

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, you need another lifetime.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I need another lifetime, yes.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:90%
For many things, I would--

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I would accept it
with gratitude.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:90%
But I know what I have.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there anything else,
that I haven't asked, that you

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:90%
think it's important to say?

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.335 align:middle line:90%
I think we have covered.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming in today.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:16:26.454 align:middle line:90%
