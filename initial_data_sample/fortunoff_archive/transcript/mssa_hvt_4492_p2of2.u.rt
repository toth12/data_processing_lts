<br>
<br>
<time begin="00:35.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
--tapes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="00:35.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it made it more difficult.<br>
<br>
<time begin="00:38.068"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And we are rolling.<br>
<br>
<time begin="00:41.280"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So we were just discussing<br>
the interviewer methodology.<br>
<time begin="00:45.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I-- if you're willing,<br>
and you don't have to--<br>
<time begin="00:50.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to comment, you<br>
said that you used<br>
<time begin="00:53.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to do five to seven<br>
testimonies in one day, which<br>
<time begin="00:59.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to me is mind-boggling.<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:01.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I can't imagine doing that.<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:04.879"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I can't imagine<br>
the mental stamina<br>
<time begin="01:08.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the physical<br>
stamina it takes.<br>
<time begin="01:10.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And you said you swam to<br>
kind of relieve yourself.<br>
<time begin="01:15.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And you talked a little bit<br>
about protective amnesia.<br>
<time begin="01:18.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But at that point, you<br>
were so immersed in it.<br>
<time begin="01:24.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And also, five days<br>
a week, working<br>
<time begin="01:28.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
as a psychiatrist, as-- as an<br>
interviewer and as a survivor,<br>
<time begin="01:33.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
yourself, how did that<br>
impact the process for you?<br>
<time begin="01:39.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And do you think that,<br>
in general, survivors<br>
<time begin="01:44.020"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
should be interviewers?<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:45.864"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Should be interviewed?<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:46.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Should be interviewers?<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:50.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
If I take myself as<br>
a model, then, yes.<br>
<time begin="01:54.445"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="01:57.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Of course, their own experience<br>
is alive and awakened.<br>
<time begin="02:03.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think that part--<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:06.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
exans-- an example of that<br>
is my interview of my mother,<br>
<time begin="02:11.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that she spoke of experiences<br>
that I was part of.<br>
<time begin="02:16.500"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they were the same.<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:17.475"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Or they were<br>
different, sometimes.<br>
<time begin="02:20.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And there was, uh, moments<br>
in which I pointed out<br>
<time begin="02:25.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
the difference and<br>
moments I kept silent,<br>
<time begin="02:27.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
because she needed it to<br>
tell it the way she told it.<br>
<time begin="02:31.948"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Uh, I think the survivor<br>
herself knows whether she<br>
<time begin="02:38.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
could be an interviewer or not.<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:41.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You know, if it take-- there<br>
may be people for whom this is<br>
<time begin="02:47.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
so, uh, upsetting, so--<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:52.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, such-- causes such<br>
an emotional storm,<br>
<time begin="02:56.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that they shouldn't<br>
be interviewer.<br>
<time begin="02:58.160"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But they will know it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="02:59.076"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they will know it,<br>
at least till they try.<br>
<time begin="03:01.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they know what-- they<br>
find out that they do it.<br>
<time begin="03:03.975"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It's-- I have a<br>
lifelong training,<br>
<time begin="03:07.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
how to involve myself and<br>
come back to m-- to the orig--<br>
<time begin="03:14.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
my original self, so.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:18.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And be completely<br>
there, yet return.<br>
<time begin="03:24.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Does it take a toll?<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:25.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:26.260"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Will I need to swim after this?<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:28.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:29.472"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I probably will go swimming.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:32.938"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Uh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:34.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Is there any alternative<br>
way to do it?<br>
<time begin="03:37.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I say this with<br>
qualifications-- no.<br>
<time begin="03:42.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You have to be all the<br>
way there and to live it<br>
<time begin="03:46.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and to struggle with<br>
it and to feel it.<br>
<time begin="03:49.615"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And sometimes, it's terrifying<br>
in order to make it--<br>
<time begin="03:56.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
make it come into being.<br>
<br>
<time begin="03:58.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You can stop faking.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:01.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No faking here.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:03.980"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:05.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So if survivors were--<br>
are able to live a life,<br>
<time begin="04:09.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they're also able to have an--<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:11.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to do an interview and to,<br>
uh, be in-- into themselves<br>
<time begin="04:19.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and into the experience<br>
they are sharing,<br>
<time begin="04:21.899"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
they are h-- they are<br>
hearing, and the-- the impact<br>
<time begin="04:25.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that the one has on the other.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:28.996"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:30.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Do, uh, particular<br>
situations stir me up more?<br>
<time begin="04:38.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Absolutely, uh,<br>
particularly when<br>
<time begin="04:40.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there's terror<br>
involved, when, uh,<br>
<time begin="04:46.060"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
German uniforms are present.<br>
<br>
<time begin="04:48.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I'm not talking<br>
empty uniform,<br>
<time begin="04:50.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I'm talking with, uh,<br>
the soldiers inside.<br>
<time begin="04:54.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I remember my own<br>
moments of terror in that.<br>
<time begin="05:00.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, maybe that's how I can.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:05.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The-- the person<br>
interviewed feels<br>
<time begin="05:09.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
better understood<br>
and better, um,<br>
<time begin="05:13.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
touched if they sensed that<br>
they elicit something in me.<br>
<time begin="05:17.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:21.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So, uh, do I pay a price for it?<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:25.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yes, I pay a price for it.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:26.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It's not-- I have to<br>
bring myself back to--<br>
<time begin="05:32.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
What is terribly<br>
important is that you--<br>
<time begin="05:35.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
interviewer feels<br>
loved, that he's not--<br>
<time begin="05:38.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
not alone.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:41.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, I was very<br>
fortunate in that way.<br>
<time begin="05:47.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I felt loved as a child and<br>
also throughout my life.<br>
<time begin="05:51.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um.<br>
<br>
<time begin="05:54.370"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think, you know, I'm free<br>
associating, and that's OK.<br>
<time begin="05:57.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think that here is how<br>
I married [? Johanna, ?]<br>
<time begin="06:01.420"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
who was able to not only cross<br>
an ocean but cross a religion,<br>
<time begin="06:13.530"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
cross an experience, and<br>
became an observant Jew.<br>
<time begin="06:18.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it was a way of<br>
loving and being with me.<br>
<time begin="06:23.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, that was<br>
enormously empowering.<br>
<time begin="06:29.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Uh.<br>
<br>
<time begin="06:31.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So it's, uh, the<br>
interviewed's relationship<br>
<time begin="06:39.320"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but stemming from a--<br>
<br>
<time begin="06:41.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
a relatedness of the<br>
interviewer, who can offer it.<br>
<time begin="06:46.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="06:50.682"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um.<br>
<br>
<time begin="06:53.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I think it continues<br>
to be a relationship<br>
<time begin="06:56.690"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
after the interview is over.<br>
<br>
<time begin="06:58.540"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I found that, when<br>
I re-interviewed people,<br>
<time begin="07:00.830"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that we were-- there was a very<br>
strong connection between us,<br>
<time begin="07:04.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
although we hadn't<br>
spoken for decades.<br>
<time begin="07:06.815"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:09.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Even, it was embarrassing that<br>
I'd forgotten who they were.<br>
<time begin="07:14.684"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh--<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:16.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But not the reverse?<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:18.180"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Pardon?<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:18.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But not the reverse?<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:19.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:19.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But not the reverse.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:20.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:22.990"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, I-- in some case,<br>
I'd forgotten [INAUDIBLE] part<br>
<time begin="07:27.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of their story.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:28.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But in others, I remembered<br>
their story, very vividly.<br>
<time begin="07:31.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And there are<br>
psychological factors<br>
<time begin="07:33.600"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
why there is more forgetting<br>
or less forgetting.<br>
<time begin="07:36.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So when you did<br>
these re-interviews,<br>
<time begin="07:38.670"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
you didn't watch<br>
the first testimony<br>
<time begin="07:40.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
before you went in to<br>
do the re-interview?<br>
<time begin="07:41.950"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:42.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I didn't want to do that, no.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:43.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I wanted to rely on<br>
what I remembered.<br>
<time begin="07:46.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And that was for another<br>
project, not for us.<br>
<time begin="07:49.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That was for another<br>
project for--<br>
<time begin="07:53.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, funded by the Slave Labor--<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:55.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Right, right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="07:56.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But when we did the<br>
re-interviews here,<br>
<time begin="08:00.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
we did watch the<br>
first testimonies.<br>
<time begin="08:02.304"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I don't know if<br>
you remember that.<br>
<time begin="08:03.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I remember, vaguely, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:04.750"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Right.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:05.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:06.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, um, you know, that<br>
was part of our protocol--<br>
<time begin="08:09.581"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yeah, yeah.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:10.080"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
--in doing those re-interviews.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:12.156"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:14.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Going back to the-- the whole<br>
development of this methodology<br>
<time begin="08:18.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the way you think about it<br>
and the influence you've had,<br>
<time begin="08:22.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
um, and contrasting<br>
it with others, it--<br>
<time begin="08:26.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think it's, um--<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:27.708"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:31.380"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I don't want to use<br>
the word "risky,"<br>
<time begin="08:33.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but it takes a lot<br>
more confidence--<br>
<time begin="08:36.210"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:37.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
--to do what you do<br>
and to do what we do,<br>
<time begin="08:40.559"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
than it does to go in<br>
with a set of questions.<br>
<time begin="08:43.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Sure.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:45.360"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I'm wondering-- and--<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:47.290"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and it's risky to do what we<br>
do, because we expose ourselves<br>
<time begin="08:51.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to the potential of<br>
hearing terrible--<br>
<time begin="08:56.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I-- I-- there isn't words.<br>
<br>
<time begin="08:58.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
There aren't words to describe<br>
some of the experiences<br>
<time begin="09:02.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that we've heard.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:04.590"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But with a questionnaire,<br>
you control that.<br>
<time begin="09:09.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So it's much less risky.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:10.751"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:11.250"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:13.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Now, do you think that, in<br>
spite of that questionnaire,<br>
<time begin="09:17.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
people can share those memories?<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:21.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think the<br>
questionnaire is a buffer<br>
<time begin="09:23.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and probably<br>
reduces the sharing.<br>
<time begin="09:25.800"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Except that there is a<br>
internal pressure to tell<br>
<time begin="09:32.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and a yearning to be heard.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:37.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So that's why, now, interviews,<br>
simply making this available.<br>
<time begin="09:43.062"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It wa-- the child was born.<br>
<br>
<time begin="09:45.970"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It came out with<br>
some help, sometimes.<br>
<time begin="09:51.310"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So I think that, in spite<br>
of the questionnaire,<br>
<time begin="09:53.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
people will speak and<br>
say what is pressuring,<br>
<time begin="10:01.995"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
because it's a relief.<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:04.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And there's this--<br>
this yearning.<br>
<time begin="10:05.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And whether-- at<br>
least, they can--<br>
<time begin="10:08.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
for them, there can<br>
be an imaginary, uh,<br>
<time begin="10:11.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
listener behind<br>
that piece of paper,<br>
<time begin="10:12.850"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that page with the questions.<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:15.636"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Um, it's bo-- also likely that<br>
the interviewer will interfere.<br>
<time begin="10:21.174"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it's enough that you show<br>
that you don't want to hear,<br>
<time begin="10:25.490"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and then it's all--<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:27.140"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
there's no story--<br>
there's no testimony.<br>
<time begin="10:30.730"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So, again, it-- it's<br>
a wide spectrum.<br>
<time begin="10:35.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In some situations, yes, the--<br>
something will come through.<br>
<time begin="10:39.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
In others, it will<br>
be chopped off.<br>
<time begin="10:44.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Do you think that there's any<br>
difference between those early<br>
<time begin="10:48.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
testimonies, that were taken<br>
in the '70s and '80s, only--<br>
<time begin="10:54.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I'm saying "only"--<br>
<br>
<time begin="10:55.740"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
30-something to<br>
40-something years<br>
<time begin="10:57.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
after the experience,<br>
and the later ones,<br>
<time begin="11:01.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that you did re-interviews of--<br>
of people who are now 60 and 70<br>
<time begin="11:07.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
years from this experience?<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:09.030"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:12.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I-- I think the<br>
time li-- time is--<br>
<time begin="11:16.748"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, I don't think there's<br>
a difference between '70s<br>
<time begin="11:19.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and '80s and the--<br>
the later ones.<br>
<time begin="11:22.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
There could be a difference<br>
between '45, '47,<br>
<time begin="11:27.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and the later ones.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:30.840"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And I've a little--<br>
uh, uh-- studied them,<br>
<time begin="11:34.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
both their interviews.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:36.070"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:37.650"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And they have much more<br>
a quality of immediacy<br>
<time begin="11:42.415"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and of an appeal.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:44.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
There's a message of<br>
this-- the "shtetl brennt,"<br>
<time begin="11:48.890"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
to tell that maybe<br>
some help will come in.<br>
<time begin="11:52.090"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It's not yet over.<br>
<br>
<time begin="11:54.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Uh, even, still rescue and<br>
change the course of history.<br>
<time begin="11:57.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That's a quality of the<br>
immediate interview.<br>
<time begin="12:00.580"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
My daughters were taken<br>
away, sent to Auschwitz.<br>
<time begin="12:03.610"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But are they dead?<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:05.171"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The question mark.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:07.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So those early<br>
interviews are a--<br>
<time begin="12:09.900"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
have a quality of a cry for<br>
help and for intervention.<br>
<time begin="12:15.480"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Whereas the later<br>
one, it's clear<br>
<time begin="12:17.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that the daughter is dead.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:19.724"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And how does one deal with a<br>
memory and the last moments?<br>
<time begin="12:24.500"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And, uh, there's<br>
work that has been<br>
<time begin="12:27.400"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
done, in the-- in the<br>
interim, by the survivor.<br>
<time begin="12:32.350"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But I do not know that there's<br>
a difference between the 1970s,<br>
<time begin="12:36.040"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
'80s, and later on.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:39.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yes, I-- what I can say<br>
about the interviews,<br>
<time begin="12:43.810"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that when I<br>
re-interviewed people,<br>
<time begin="12:47.620"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Leon's interview, the<br>
first time, is one hour.<br>
<time begin="12:51.330"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
The second time is<br>
two and a half hours.<br>
<time begin="12:54.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Well, that was because you<br>
only had one hour of tape.<br>
<time begin="12:57.430"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
We had 20-minutes tape then.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:58.971"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Tape.<br>
<br>
<time begin="12:59.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But, you-- you know, it<br>
was very limited, by the--<br>
<time begin="13:01.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
It was limited.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:03.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And so but who is the cause?<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:05.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think, it's also our<br>
ways-- way of interview,<br>
<time begin="13:07.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
of knowing how to interview.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:09.100"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And it's a com-- very<br>
more differentiated story,<br>
<time begin="13:12.510"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that he was not only<br>
a-- the thief of bread<br>
<time begin="13:15.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
but the bread bringer.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:17.170"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He worked in a bakery and<br>
brought her, uh, bread, each--<br>
<time begin="13:21.780"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
and he used to extract the<br>
bread through the window.<br>
<time begin="13:25.720"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And then there were grates,<br>
so it was two sticks.<br>
<time begin="13:27.910"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That this cut up<br>
the bread next time.<br>
<time begin="13:30.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So he enourished his family, not<br>
only took bread to his family,<br>
<time begin="13:33.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
nourished.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:34.300"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
This was a very different.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:35.470"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So the first memory was like a<br>
cover memory, a screen memory--<br>
<time begin="13:38.680"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Mhm.<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:39.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
--that didn't tell<br>
the full memory.<br>
<time begin="13:42.340"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But is it Leon who has in--<br>
<br>
<time begin="13:45.855"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
uh, integrated more,<br>
knows more with age,<br>
<time begin="13:49.390"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
or is it our interviewing that<br>
was different 25 years later?<br>
<time begin="13:54.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
That's very interesting to me,<br>
because, when we were doing<br>
<time begin="13:57.940"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
our re-interview project,<br>
which was quite a bit earlier--<br>
<time begin="14:01.120"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
it was in the early to<br>
mid-'90s-- and we asked Leon.<br>
<time begin="14:05.920"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He said no.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:07.371"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He what?<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:07.870"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He said?<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:08.410"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He said no.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:09.010"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He didn't want to<br>
be interviewed?<br>
<time begin="14:09.930"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
No.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:10.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
He wouldn't be re-interviewed.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:11.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Interesting.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:13.450"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You know, we asked all<br>
four of those original.<br>
<time begin="14:16.000"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And two said yes,<br>
and two said no.<br>
<time begin="14:18.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And Leon said no.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:19.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
So, you know, I'm just wondering<br>
about the passage of time.<br>
<time begin="14:24.021"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:24.520"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:27.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Again, you are raising<br>
questions that I<br>
<time begin="14:31.200"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
think should be studied in a<br>
methodological, rigorous way.<br>
<time begin="14:36.550"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And unfortunately, I don't<br>
see that study happening.<br>
<time begin="14:39.150"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Or maybe having the testimonies,<br>
it will happen one day.<br>
<time begin="14:42.440"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:46.130"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Well--<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:46.630"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
You asked me one thing<br>
that I-- that I regretted,<br>
<time begin="14:50.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
that there's not<br>
much more sub-facets<br>
<time begin="14:54.230"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
studied of the testimonies.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:56.220"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
And there is--<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:57.460"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Well, you need another lifetime.<br>
<br>
<time begin="14:59.640"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I need another lifetime, yes.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:01.270"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
For many things, I would--<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:03.110"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I would accept it<br>
with gratitude.<br>
<time begin="15:06.190"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
But I know what I have.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:10.700"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Now, is there anything else,<br>
that I haven't asked, that you<br>
<time begin="15:13.570"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
think it's important to say?<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:16.960"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
I think we have covered.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:18.335"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:21.770"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Thank you for coming in today.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:23.710"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
<time begin="15:25.560"><pos y="3"/><clear/>
<br>
<br>
