00:00:00.000,00:00:35.270

00:00:35.270,00:00:35.770
--tapes.

00:00:35.770,00:00:38.068
And it made it more difficult.

00:00:38.068,00:00:41.280
And we are rolling.

00:00:41.280,00:00:45.530
So we were just discussing
the interviewer methodology.

00:00:45.530,00:00:50.680
And I-- if you're willing,
and you don't have to--

00:00:50.680,00:00:53.060
to comment, you
said that you used

00:00:53.060,00:00:59.540
to do five to seven
testimonies in one day, which

00:00:59.540,00:01:01.970
to me is mind-boggling.

00:01:01.970,00:01:04.879
I can't imagine doing that.

00:01:04.879,00:01:08.360
I can't imagine
the mental stamina

00:01:08.360,00:01:10.040
and the physical
stamina it takes.

00:01:10.040,00:01:15.410
And you said you swam to
kind of relieve yourself.

00:01:15.410,00:01:18.030
And you talked a little bit
about protective amnesia.

00:01:18.030,00:01:24.130
But at that point, you
were so immersed in it.

00:01:24.130,00:01:28.840
And also, five days
a week, working

00:01:28.840,00:01:33.490
as a psychiatrist, as-- as an
interviewer and as a survivor,

00:01:33.490,00:01:39.840
yourself, how did that
impact the process for you?

00:01:39.840,00:01:44.020
And do you think that,
in general, survivors

00:01:44.020,00:01:45.864
should be interviewers?

00:01:45.864,00:01:46.780
Should be interviewed?

00:01:46.780,00:01:50.890
Should be interviewers?

00:01:50.890,00:01:54.445
If I take myself as
a model, then, yes.

00:01:54.445,00:01:57.520

00:01:57.520,00:02:03.970
Of course, their own experience
is alive and awakened.

00:02:03.970,00:02:06.920
I think that part--

00:02:06.920,00:02:11.920
exans-- an example of that
is my interview of my mother,

00:02:11.920,00:02:16.500
that she spoke of experiences
that I was part of.

00:02:16.500,00:02:17.475
And they were the same.

00:02:17.475,00:02:20.590
Or they were
different, sometimes.

00:02:20.590,00:02:25.180
And there was, uh, moments
in which I pointed out

00:02:25.180,00:02:27.130
the difference and
moments I kept silent,

00:02:27.130,00:02:31.948
because she needed it to
tell it the way she told it.

00:02:31.948,00:02:38.470
Uh, I think the survivor
herself knows whether she

00:02:38.470,00:02:41.580
could be an interviewer or not.

00:02:41.580,00:02:47.410
You know, if it take-- there
may be people for whom this is

00:02:47.410,00:02:52.610
so, uh, upsetting, so--

00:02:52.610,00:02:56.530
uh, such-- causes such
an emotional storm,

00:02:56.530,00:02:58.160
that they shouldn't
be interviewer.

00:02:58.160,00:02:59.076
But they will know it.

00:02:59.076,00:03:01.270
And they will know it,
at least till they try.

00:03:01.270,00:03:03.975
And they know what-- they
find out that they do it.

00:03:03.975,00:03:07.420
It's-- I have a
lifelong training,

00:03:07.420,00:03:14.470
how to involve myself and
come back to m-- to the orig--

00:03:14.470,00:03:18.730
my original self, so.

00:03:18.730,00:03:24.250
And be completely
there, yet return.

00:03:24.250,00:03:25.390
Does it take a toll?

00:03:25.390,00:03:26.260
Yes.

00:03:26.260,00:03:28.120
Will I need to swim after this?

00:03:28.120,00:03:29.472
Yes.

00:03:29.472,00:03:32.938
And I probably will go swimming.

00:03:32.938,00:03:34.330
Uh.

00:03:34.330,00:03:37.770
Is there any alternative
way to do it?

00:03:37.770,00:03:42.570
And I say this with
qualifications-- no.

00:03:42.570,00:03:46.810
You have to be all the
way there and to live it

00:03:46.810,00:03:49.615
and to struggle with
it and to feel it.

00:03:49.615,00:03:56.940
And sometimes, it's terrifying
in order to make it--

00:03:56.940,00:03:58.890
make it come into being.

00:03:58.890,00:04:01.510
You can stop faking.

00:04:01.510,00:04:03.980
No faking here.

00:04:03.980,00:04:05.320
Um.

00:04:05.320,00:04:09.520
So if survivors were--
are able to live a life,

00:04:09.520,00:04:11.650
they're also able to have an--

00:04:11.650,00:04:19.060
to do an interview and to,
uh, be in-- into themselves

00:04:19.060,00:04:21.899
and into the experience
they are sharing,

00:04:21.899,00:04:25.990
they are h-- they are
hearing, and the-- the impact

00:04:25.990,00:04:28.996
that the one has on the other.

00:04:28.996,00:04:30.730
Um.

00:04:30.730,00:04:38.800
Do, uh, particular
situations stir me up more?

00:04:38.800,00:04:40.960
Absolutely, uh,
particularly when

00:04:40.960,00:04:46.060
there's terror
involved, when, uh,

00:04:46.060,00:04:48.730
German uniforms are present.

00:04:48.730,00:04:50.420
And I'm not talking
empty uniform,

00:04:50.420,00:04:54.350
I'm talking with, uh,
the soldiers inside.

00:04:54.350,00:05:00.310
And I remember my own
moments of terror in that.

00:05:00.310,00:05:05.650
And, uh, maybe that's how I can.

00:05:05.650,00:05:09.450
The-- the person
interviewed feels

00:05:09.450,00:05:13.380
better understood
and better, um,

00:05:13.380,00:05:17.920
touched if they sensed that
they elicit something in me.

00:05:17.920,00:05:21.580

00:05:21.580,00:05:25.340
So, uh, do I pay a price for it?

00:05:25.340,00:05:26.950
Yes, I pay a price for it.

00:05:26.950,00:05:32.620
It's not-- I have to
bring myself back to--

00:05:32.620,00:05:35.290
What is terribly
important is that you--

00:05:35.290,00:05:38.900
interviewer feels
loved, that he's not--

00:05:38.900,00:05:41.640
not alone.

00:05:41.640,00:05:47.410
And, uh, I was very
fortunate in that way.

00:05:47.410,00:05:51.920
I felt loved as a child and
also throughout my life.

00:05:51.920,00:05:54.370
Um.

00:05:54.370,00:05:57.170
I think, you know, I'm free
associating, and that's OK.

00:05:57.170,00:06:01.420
I think that here is how
I married [? Johanna, ?]

00:06:01.420,00:06:13.530
who was able to not only cross
an ocean but cross a religion,

00:06:13.530,00:06:18.550
cross an experience, and
became an observant Jew.

00:06:18.550,00:06:23.510
And it was a way of
loving and being with me.

00:06:23.510,00:06:29.310
And, uh, that was
enormously empowering.

00:06:29.310,00:06:31.270
Uh.

00:06:31.270,00:06:39.320
So it's, uh, the
interviewed's relationship

00:06:39.320,00:06:41.580
but stemming from a--

00:06:41.580,00:06:46.770
a relatedness of the
interviewer, who can offer it.

00:06:46.770,00:06:50.682

00:06:50.682,00:06:53.620
Um.

00:06:53.620,00:06:56.690
And I think it continues
to be a relationship

00:06:56.690,00:06:58.540
after the interview is over.

00:06:58.540,00:07:00.830
And I found that, when
I re-interviewed people,

00:07:00.830,00:07:04.920
that we were-- there was a very
strong connection between us,

00:07:04.920,00:07:06.815
although we hadn't
spoken for decades.

00:07:06.815,00:07:09.710

00:07:09.710,00:07:14.684
Even, it was embarrassing that
I'd forgotten who they were.

00:07:14.684,00:07:16.870
And, uh--

00:07:16.870,00:07:18.180
But not the reverse?

00:07:18.180,00:07:18.800
Pardon?

00:07:18.800,00:07:19.350
But not the reverse?

00:07:19.350,00:07:19.550
No.

00:07:19.550,00:07:20.480
But not the reverse.

00:07:20.480,00:07:22.990
No.

00:07:22.990,00:07:27.510
And, uh, I-- in some case,
I'd forgotten [INAUDIBLE] part

00:07:27.510,00:07:28.410
of their story.

00:07:28.410,00:07:31.730
But in others, I remembered
their story, very vividly.

00:07:31.730,00:07:33.600
And there are
psychological factors

00:07:33.600,00:07:36.570
why there is more forgetting
or less forgetting.

00:07:36.570,00:07:38.670
So when you did
these re-interviews,

00:07:38.670,00:07:40.200
you didn't watch
the first testimony

00:07:40.200,00:07:41.950
before you went in to
do the re-interview?

00:07:41.950,00:07:42.750
No.

00:07:42.750,00:07:43.960
I didn't want to do that, no.

00:07:43.960,00:07:46.470
I wanted to rely on
what I remembered.

00:07:46.470,00:07:49.410
And that was for another
project, not for us.

00:07:49.410,00:07:53.110
That was for another
project for--

00:07:53.110,00:07:55.410
uh, funded by the Slave Labor--

00:07:55.410,00:07:56.640
Right, right.

00:07:56.640,00:08:00.390
But when we did the
re-interviews here,

00:08:00.390,00:08:02.304
we did watch the
first testimonies.

00:08:02.304,00:08:03.720
I don't know if
you remember that.

00:08:03.720,00:08:04.750
I remember, vaguely, yes.

00:08:04.750,00:08:05.250
Right.

00:08:05.250,00:08:06.150
Yeah.

00:08:06.150,00:08:09.581
And, um, you know, that
was part of our protocol--

00:08:09.581,00:08:10.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:10.080,00:08:12.156
--in doing those re-interviews.

00:08:12.156,00:08:14.490
Um.

00:08:14.490,00:08:18.360
Going back to the-- the whole
development of this methodology

00:08:18.360,00:08:22.350
and the way you think about it
and the influence you've had,

00:08:22.350,00:08:26.040
um, and contrasting
it with others, it--

00:08:26.040,00:08:27.708
I think it's, um--

00:08:27.708,00:08:31.380

00:08:31.380,00:08:33.220
I don't want to use
the word "risky,"

00:08:33.220,00:08:36.210
but it takes a lot
more confidence--

00:08:36.210,00:08:37.740
Mhm.

00:08:37.740,00:08:40.559
--to do what you do
and to do what we do,

00:08:40.559,00:08:43.560
than it does to go in
with a set of questions.

00:08:43.560,00:08:45.360
Sure.

00:08:45.360,00:08:47.290
And I'm wondering-- and--

00:08:47.290,00:08:51.840
and it's risky to do what we
do, because we expose ourselves

00:08:51.840,00:08:56.460
to the potential of
hearing terrible--

00:08:56.460,00:08:58.440
I-- I-- there isn't words.

00:08:58.440,00:09:02.430
There aren't words to describe
some of the experiences

00:09:02.430,00:09:04.590
that we've heard.

00:09:04.590,00:09:09.430
But with a questionnaire,
you control that.

00:09:09.430,00:09:10.751
So it's much less risky.

00:09:10.751,00:09:11.250
Mhm.

00:09:11.250,00:09:13.770

00:09:13.770,00:09:17.640
Now, do you think that, in
spite of that questionnaire,

00:09:17.640,00:09:21.700
people can share those memories?

00:09:21.700,00:09:23.470
I think the
questionnaire is a buffer

00:09:23.470,00:09:25.800
and probably
reduces the sharing.

00:09:25.800,00:09:32.330
Except that there is a
internal pressure to tell

00:09:32.330,00:09:37.140
and a yearning to be heard.

00:09:37.140,00:09:43.062
So that's why, now, interviews,
simply making this available.

00:09:43.062,00:09:45.970
It wa-- the child was born.

00:09:45.970,00:09:51.310
It came out with
some help, sometimes.

00:09:51.310,00:09:53.350
So I think that, in spite
of the questionnaire,

00:09:53.350,00:10:01.995
people will speak and
say what is pressuring,

00:10:01.995,00:10:04.010
because it's a relief.

00:10:04.010,00:10:05.480
And there's this--
this yearning.

00:10:05.480,00:10:08.330
And whether-- at
least, they can--

00:10:08.330,00:10:11.010
for them, there can
be an imaginary, uh,

00:10:11.010,00:10:12.850
listener behind
that piece of paper,

00:10:12.850,00:10:15.636
that page with the questions.

00:10:15.636,00:10:21.174
Um, it's bo-- also likely that
the interviewer will interfere.

00:10:21.174,00:10:25.490
And it's enough that you show
that you don't want to hear,

00:10:25.490,00:10:27.140
and then it's all--

00:10:27.140,00:10:30.730
there's no story--
there's no testimony.

00:10:30.730,00:10:35.550
So, again, it-- it's
a wide spectrum.

00:10:35.550,00:10:39.910
In some situations, yes, the--
something will come through.

00:10:39.910,00:10:44.350
In others, it will
be chopped off.

00:10:44.350,00:10:48.120
Do you think that there's any
difference between those early

00:10:48.120,00:10:54.510
testimonies, that were taken
in the '70s and '80s, only--

00:10:54.510,00:10:55.740
I'm saying "only"--

00:10:55.740,00:10:57.780
30-something to
40-something years

00:10:57.780,00:11:01.170
after the experience,
and the later ones,

00:11:01.170,00:11:07.200
that you did re-interviews of--
of people who are now 60 and 70

00:11:07.200,00:11:09.030
years from this experience?

00:11:09.030,00:11:12.770

00:11:12.770,00:11:16.748
I-- I think the
time li-- time is--

00:11:16.748,00:11:19.930
uh, I don't think there's
a difference between '70s

00:11:19.930,00:11:22.400
and '80s and the--
the later ones.

00:11:22.400,00:11:27.910
There could be a difference
between '45, '47,

00:11:27.910,00:11:30.840
and the later ones.

00:11:30.840,00:11:34.570
And I've a little--
uh, uh-- studied them,

00:11:34.570,00:11:36.070
both their interviews.

00:11:36.070,00:11:37.650
Mhm.

00:11:37.650,00:11:42.415
And they have much more
a quality of immediacy

00:11:42.415,00:11:44.300
and of an appeal.

00:11:44.300,00:11:48.890
There's a message of
this-- the "shtetl brennt,"

00:11:48.890,00:11:52.090
to tell that maybe
some help will come in.

00:11:52.090,00:11:54.300
It's not yet over.

00:11:54.300,00:11:57.810
Uh, even, still rescue and
change the course of history.

00:11:57.810,00:12:00.580
That's a quality of the
immediate interview.

00:12:00.580,00:12:03.610
My daughters were taken
away, sent to Auschwitz.

00:12:03.610,00:12:05.171
But are they dead?

00:12:05.171,00:12:07.330
The question mark.

00:12:07.330,00:12:09.900
So those early
interviews are a--

00:12:09.900,00:12:15.480
have a quality of a cry for
help and for intervention.

00:12:15.480,00:12:17.620
Whereas the later
one, it's clear

00:12:17.620,00:12:19.724
that the daughter is dead.

00:12:19.724,00:12:24.500
And how does one deal with a
memory and the last moments?

00:12:24.500,00:12:27.400
And, uh, there's
work that has been

00:12:27.400,00:12:32.350
done, in the-- in the
interim, by the survivor.

00:12:32.350,00:12:36.040
But I do not know that there's
a difference between the 1970s,

00:12:36.040,00:12:39.190
'80s, and later on.

00:12:39.190,00:12:43.810
Yes, I-- what I can say
about the interviews,

00:12:43.810,00:12:47.620
that when I
re-interviewed people,

00:12:47.620,00:12:51.330
Leon's interview, the
first time, is one hour.

00:12:51.330,00:12:54.520
The second time is
two and a half hours.

00:12:54.520,00:12:57.430
Well, that was because you
only had one hour of tape.

00:12:57.430,00:12:58.971
We had 20-minutes tape then.

00:12:58.971,00:12:59.470
Tape.

00:12:59.470,00:13:01.870
But, you-- you know, it
was very limited, by the--

00:13:01.870,00:13:03.100
It was limited.

00:13:03.100,00:13:05.110
And so but who is the cause?

00:13:05.110,00:13:07.930
I think, it's also our
ways-- way of interview,

00:13:07.930,00:13:09.100
of knowing how to interview.

00:13:09.100,00:13:12.510
And it's a com-- very
more differentiated story,

00:13:12.510,00:13:15.460
that he was not only
a-- the thief of bread

00:13:15.460,00:13:17.170
but the bread bringer.

00:13:17.170,00:13:21.780
He worked in a bakery and
brought her, uh, bread, each--

00:13:21.780,00:13:25.720
and he used to extract the
bread through the window.

00:13:25.720,00:13:27.910
And then there were grates,
so it was two sticks.

00:13:27.910,00:13:30.190
That this cut up
the bread next time.

00:13:30.190,00:13:33.680
So he enourished his family, not
only took bread to his family,

00:13:33.680,00:13:34.300
nourished.

00:13:34.300,00:13:35.470
This was a very different.

00:13:35.470,00:13:38.680
So the first memory was like a
cover memory, a screen memory--

00:13:38.680,00:13:39.190
Mhm.

00:13:39.190,00:13:42.340
--that didn't tell
the full memory.

00:13:42.340,00:13:45.855
But is it Leon who has in--

00:13:45.855,00:13:49.390
uh, integrated more,
knows more with age,

00:13:49.390,00:13:54.930
or is it our interviewing that
was different 25 years later?

00:13:54.930,00:13:57.940
That's very interesting to me,
because, when we were doing

00:13:57.940,00:14:01.120
our re-interview project,
which was quite a bit earlier--

00:14:01.120,00:14:05.920
it was in the early to
mid-'90s-- and we asked Leon.

00:14:05.920,00:14:07.371
He said no.

00:14:07.371,00:14:07.870
He what?

00:14:07.870,00:14:08.410
He said?

00:14:08.410,00:14:09.010
He said no.

00:14:09.010,00:14:09.930
He didn't want to
be interviewed?

00:14:09.930,00:14:10.460
No.

00:14:10.460,00:14:11.710
He wouldn't be re-interviewed.

00:14:11.710,00:14:13.450
Interesting.

00:14:13.450,00:14:16.000
You know, we asked all
four of those original.

00:14:16.000,00:14:18.150
And two said yes,
and two said no.

00:14:18.150,00:14:19.440
And Leon said no.

00:14:19.440,00:14:24.021
So, you know, I'm just wondering
about the passage of time.

00:14:24.021,00:14:24.520
Yes.

00:14:24.520,00:14:27.960

00:14:27.960,00:14:31.200
Again, you are raising
questions that I

00:14:31.200,00:14:36.550
think should be studied in a
methodological, rigorous way.

00:14:36.550,00:14:39.150
And unfortunately, I don't
see that study happening.

00:14:39.150,00:14:42.440
Or maybe having the testimonies,
it will happen one day.

00:14:42.440,00:14:46.130

00:14:46.130,00:14:46.630
Well--

00:14:46.630,00:14:50.270
You asked me one thing
that I-- that I regretted,

00:14:50.270,00:14:54.230
that there's not
much more sub-facets

00:14:54.230,00:14:56.220
studied of the testimonies.

00:14:56.220,00:14:57.460
And there is--

00:14:57.460,00:14:59.640
Well, you need another lifetime.

00:14:59.640,00:15:01.270
I need another lifetime, yes.

00:15:01.270,00:15:03.110
For many things, I would--

00:15:03.110,00:15:06.190
I would accept it
with gratitude.

00:15:06.190,00:15:10.700
But I know what I have.

00:15:10.700,00:15:13.570
Now, is there anything else,
that I haven't asked, that you

00:15:13.570,00:15:16.960
think it's important to say?

00:15:16.960,00:15:18.335
I think we have covered.

00:15:18.335,00:15:21.770

00:15:21.770,00:15:23.710
Thank you for coming in today.

00:15:23.710,00:15:25.560
Thank you.

00:15:25.560,00:16:26.454
