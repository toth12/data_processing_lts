[00:00:00.00]


[00:00:35.27]
--tapes.

[00:00:35.77]
And it made it more difficult.

[00:00:38.07]
And we are rolling.

[00:00:41.28]
So we were just discussing
the interviewer methodology.
[00:00:45.53]
And I-- if you're willing,
and you don't have to--
[00:00:50.68]
to comment, you
said that you used
[00:00:53.06]
to do five to seven
testimonies in one day, which
[00:00:59.54]
to me is mind-boggling.

[00:01:01.97]
I can't imagine doing that.

[00:01:04.88]
I can't imagine
the mental stamina
[00:01:08.36]
and the physical
stamina it takes.
[00:01:10.04]
And you said you swam to
kind of relieve yourself.
[00:01:15.41]
And you talked a little bit
about protective amnesia.
[00:01:18.03]
But at that point, you
were so immersed in it.
[00:01:24.13]
And also, five days
a week, working
[00:01:28.84]
as a psychiatrist, as-- as an
interviewer and as a survivor,
[00:01:33.49]
yourself, how did that
impact the process for you?
[00:01:39.84]
And do you think that,
in general, survivors
[00:01:44.02]
should be interviewers?

[00:01:45.86]
Should be interviewed?

[00:01:46.78]
Should be interviewers?

[00:01:50.89]
If I take myself as
a model, then, yes.
[00:01:54.45]


[00:01:57.52]
Of course, their own experience
is alive and awakened.
[00:02:03.97]
I think that part--

[00:02:06.92]
exans-- an example of that
is my interview of my mother,
[00:02:11.92]
that she spoke of experiences
that I was part of.
[00:02:16.50]
And they were the same.

[00:02:17.48]
Or they were
different, sometimes.
[00:02:20.59]
And there was, uh, moments
in which I pointed out
[00:02:25.18]
the difference and
moments I kept silent,
[00:02:27.13]
because she needed it to
tell it the way she told it.
[00:02:31.95]
Uh, I think the survivor
herself knows whether she
[00:02:38.47]
could be an interviewer or not.

[00:02:41.58]
You know, if it take-- there
may be people for whom this is
[00:02:47.41]
so, uh, upsetting, so--

[00:02:52.61]
uh, such-- causes such
an emotional storm,
[00:02:56.53]
that they shouldn't
be interviewer.
[00:02:58.16]
But they will know it.

[00:02:59.08]
And they will know it,
at least till they try.
[00:03:01.27]
And they know what-- they
find out that they do it.
[00:03:03.98]
It's-- I have a
lifelong training,
[00:03:07.42]
how to involve myself and
come back to m-- to the orig--
[00:03:14.47]
my original self, so.

[00:03:18.73]
And be completely
there, yet return.
[00:03:24.25]
Does it take a toll?

[00:03:25.39]
Yes.

[00:03:26.26]
Will I need to swim after this?

[00:03:28.12]
Yes.

[00:03:29.47]
And I probably will go swimming.

[00:03:32.94]
Uh.

[00:03:34.33]
Is there any alternative
way to do it?
[00:03:37.77]
And I say this with
qualifications-- no.
[00:03:42.57]
You have to be all the
way there and to live it
[00:03:46.81]
and to struggle with
it and to feel it.
[00:03:49.62]
And sometimes, it's terrifying
in order to make it--
[00:03:56.94]
make it come into being.

[00:03:58.89]
You can stop faking.

[00:04:01.51]
No faking here.

[00:04:03.98]
Um.

[00:04:05.32]
So if survivors were--
are able to live a life,
[00:04:09.52]
they're also able to have an--

[00:04:11.65]
to do an interview and to,
uh, be in-- into themselves
[00:04:19.06]
and into the experience
they are sharing,
[00:04:21.90]
they are h-- they are
hearing, and the-- the impact
[00:04:25.99]
that the one has on the other.

[00:04:29.00]
Um.

[00:04:30.73]
Do, uh, particular
situations stir me up more?
[00:04:38.80]
Absolutely, uh,
particularly when
[00:04:40.96]
there's terror
involved, when, uh,
[00:04:46.06]
German uniforms are present.

[00:04:48.73]
And I'm not talking
empty uniform,
[00:04:50.42]
I'm talking with, uh,
the soldiers inside.
[00:04:54.35]
And I remember my own
moments of terror in that.
[00:05:00.31]
And, uh, maybe that's how I can.

[00:05:05.65]
The-- the person
interviewed feels
[00:05:09.45]
better understood
and better, um,
[00:05:13.38]
touched if they sensed that
they elicit something in me.
[00:05:17.92]


[00:05:21.58]
So, uh, do I pay a price for it?

[00:05:25.34]
Yes, I pay a price for it.

[00:05:26.95]
It's not-- I have to
bring myself back to--
[00:05:32.62]
What is terribly
important is that you--
[00:05:35.29]
interviewer feels
loved, that he's not--
[00:05:38.90]
not alone.

[00:05:41.64]
And, uh, I was very
fortunate in that way.
[00:05:47.41]
I felt loved as a child and
also throughout my life.
[00:05:51.92]
Um.

[00:05:54.37]
I think, you know, I'm free
associating, and that's OK.
[00:05:57.17]
I think that here is how
I married <<? Johanna, ?>>
[00:06:01.42]
who was able to not only cross
an ocean but cross a religion,
[00:06:13.53]
cross an experience, and
became an observant Jew.
[00:06:18.55]
And it was a way of
loving and being with me.
[00:06:23.51]
And, uh, that was
enormously empowering.
[00:06:29.31]
Uh.

[00:06:31.27]
So it's, uh, the
interviewed's relationship
[00:06:39.32]
but stemming from a--

[00:06:41.58]
a relatedness of the
interviewer, who can offer it.
[00:06:46.77]


[00:06:50.68]
Um.

[00:06:53.62]
And I think it continues
to be a relationship
[00:06:56.69]
after the interview is over.

[00:06:58.54]
And I found that, when
I re-interviewed people,
[00:07:00.83]
that we were-- there was a very
strong connection between us,
[00:07:04.92]
although we hadn't
spoken for decades.
[00:07:06.82]


[00:07:09.71]
Even, it was embarrassing that
I'd forgotten who they were.
[00:07:14.68]
And, uh--

[00:07:16.87]
But not the reverse?

[00:07:18.18]
Pardon?

[00:07:18.80]
But not the reverse?

[00:07:19.35]
No.

[00:07:19.55]
But not the reverse.

[00:07:20.48]
No.

[00:07:22.99]
And, uh, I-- in some case,
I'd forgotten <<INAUDIBLE>> part
[00:07:27.51]
of their story.

[00:07:28.41]
But in others, I remembered
their story, very vividly.
[00:07:31.73]
And there are
psychological factors
[00:07:33.60]
why there is more forgetting
or less forgetting.
[00:07:36.57]
So when you did
these re-interviews,
[00:07:38.67]
you didn't watch
the first testimony
[00:07:40.20]
before you went in to
do the re-interview?
[00:07:41.95]
No.

[00:07:42.75]
I didn't want to do that, no.

[00:07:43.96]
I wanted to rely on
what I remembered.
[00:07:46.47]
And that was for another
project, not for us.
[00:07:49.41]
That was for another
project for--
[00:07:53.11]
uh, funded by the Slave Labor--

[00:07:55.41]
Right, right.

[00:07:56.64]
But when we did the
re-interviews here,
[00:08:00.39]
we did watch the
first testimonies.
[00:08:02.30]
I don't know if
you remember that.
[00:08:03.72]
I remember, vaguely, yes.

[00:08:04.75]
Right.

[00:08:05.25]
Yeah.

[00:08:06.15]
And, um, you know, that
was part of our protocol--
[00:08:09.58]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:08:10.08]
--in doing those re-interviews.

[00:08:12.16]
Um.

[00:08:14.49]
Going back to the-- the whole
development of this methodology
[00:08:18.36]
and the way you think about it
and the influence you've had,
[00:08:22.35]
um, and contrasting
it with others, it--
[00:08:26.04]
I think it's, um--

[00:08:27.71]


[00:08:31.38]
I don't want to use
the word "risky,"
[00:08:33.22]
but it takes a lot
more confidence--
[00:08:36.21]
Mhm.

[00:08:37.74]
--to do what you do
and to do what we do,
[00:08:40.56]
than it does to go in
with a set of questions.
[00:08:43.56]
Sure.

[00:08:45.36]
And I'm wondering-- and--

[00:08:47.29]
and it's risky to do what we
do, because we expose ourselves
[00:08:51.84]
to the potential of
hearing terrible--
[00:08:56.46]
I-- I-- there isn't words.

[00:08:58.44]
There aren't words to describe
some of the experiences
[00:09:02.43]
that we've heard.

[00:09:04.59]
But with a questionnaire,
you control that.
[00:09:09.43]
So it's much less risky.

[00:09:10.75]
Mhm.

[00:09:11.25]


[00:09:13.77]
Now, do you think that, in
spite of that questionnaire,
[00:09:17.64]
people can share those memories?

[00:09:21.70]
I think the
questionnaire is a buffer
[00:09:23.47]
and probably
reduces the sharing.
[00:09:25.80]
Except that there is a
internal pressure to tell
[00:09:32.33]
and a yearning to be heard.

[00:09:37.14]
So that's why, now, interviews,
simply making this available.
[00:09:43.06]
It wa-- the child was born.

[00:09:45.97]
It came out with
some help, sometimes.
[00:09:51.31]
So I think that, in spite
of the questionnaire,
[00:09:53.35]
people will speak and
say what is pressuring,
[00:10:02.00]
because it's a relief.

[00:10:04.01]
And there's this--
this yearning.
[00:10:05.48]
And whether-- at
least, they can--
[00:10:08.33]
for them, there can
be an imaginary, uh,
[00:10:11.01]
listener behind
that piece of paper,
[00:10:12.85]
that page with the questions.

[00:10:15.64]
Um, it's bo-- also likely that
the interviewer will interfere.
[00:10:21.17]
And it's enough that you show
that you don't want to hear,
[00:10:25.49]
and then it's all--

[00:10:27.14]
there's no story--
there's no testimony.
[00:10:30.73]
So, again, it-- it's
a wide spectrum.
[00:10:35.55]
In some situations, yes, the--
something will come through.
[00:10:39.91]
In others, it will
be chopped off.
[00:10:44.35]
Do you think that there's any
difference between those early
[00:10:48.12]
testimonies, that were taken
in the '70s and '80s, only--
[00:10:54.51]
I'm saying "only"--

[00:10:55.74]
30-something to
40-something years
[00:10:57.78]
after the experience,
and the later ones,
[00:11:01.17]
that you did re-interviews of--
of people who are now 60 and 70
[00:11:07.20]
years from this experience?

[00:11:09.03]


[00:11:12.77]
I-- I think the
time li-- time is--
[00:11:16.75]
uh, I don't think there's
a difference between '70s
[00:11:19.93]
and '80s and the--
the later ones.
[00:11:22.40]
There could be a difference
between '45, '47,
[00:11:27.91]
and the later ones.

[00:11:30.84]
And I've a little--
uh, uh-- studied them,
[00:11:34.57]
both their interviews.

[00:11:36.07]
Mhm.

[00:11:37.65]
And they have much more
a quality of immediacy
[00:11:42.42]
and of an appeal.

[00:11:44.30]
There's a message of
this-- the "shtetl brennt,"
[00:11:48.89]
to tell that maybe
some help will come in.
[00:11:52.09]
It's not yet over.

[00:11:54.30]
Uh, even, still rescue and
change the course of history.
[00:11:57.81]
That's a quality of the
immediate interview.
[00:12:00.58]
My daughters were taken
away, sent to Auschwitz.
[00:12:03.61]
But are they dead?

[00:12:05.17]
The question mark.

[00:12:07.33]
So those early
interviews are a--
[00:12:09.90]
have a quality of a cry for
help and for intervention.
[00:12:15.48]
Whereas the later
one, it's clear
[00:12:17.62]
that the daughter is dead.

[00:12:19.72]
And how does one deal with a
memory and the last moments?
[00:12:24.50]
And, uh, there's
work that has been
[00:12:27.40]
done, in the-- in the
interim, by the survivor.
[00:12:32.35]
But I do not know that there's
a difference between the 1970s,
[00:12:36.04]
'80s, and later on.

[00:12:39.19]
Yes, I-- what I can say
about the interviews,
[00:12:43.81]
that when I
re-interviewed people,
[00:12:47.62]
Leon's interview, the
first time, is one hour.
[00:12:51.33]
The second time is
two and a half hours.
[00:12:54.52]
Well, that was because you
only had one hour of tape.
[00:12:57.43]
We had 20-minutes tape then.

[00:12:58.97]
Tape.

[00:12:59.47]
But, you-- you know, it
was very limited, by the--
[00:13:01.87]
It was limited.

[00:13:03.10]
And so but who is the cause?

[00:13:05.11]
I think, it's also our
ways-- way of interview,
[00:13:07.93]
of knowing how to interview.

[00:13:09.10]
And it's a com-- very
more differentiated story,
[00:13:12.51]
that he was not only
a-- the thief of bread
[00:13:15.46]
but the bread bringer.

[00:13:17.17]
He worked in a bakery and
brought her, uh, bread, each--
[00:13:21.78]
and he used to extract the
bread through the window.
[00:13:25.72]
And then there were grates,
so it was two sticks.
[00:13:27.91]
That this cut up
the bread next time.
[00:13:30.19]
So he enourished his family, not
only took bread to his family,
[00:13:33.68]
nourished.

[00:13:34.30]
This was a very different.

[00:13:35.47]
So the first memory was like a
cover memory, a screen memory--
[00:13:38.68]
Mhm.

[00:13:39.19]
--that didn't tell
the full memory.
[00:13:42.34]
But is it Leon who has in--

[00:13:45.86]
uh, integrated more,
knows more with age,
[00:13:49.39]
or is it our interviewing that
was different 25 years later?
[00:13:54.93]
That's very interesting to me,
because, when we were doing
[00:13:57.94]
our re-interview project,
which was quite a bit earlier--
[00:14:01.12]
it was in the early to
mid-'90s-- and we asked Leon.
[00:14:05.92]
He said no.

[00:14:07.37]
He what?

[00:14:07.87]
He said?

[00:14:08.41]
He said no.

[00:14:09.01]
He didn't want to
be interviewed?
[00:14:09.93]
No.

[00:14:10.46]
He wouldn't be re-interviewed.

[00:14:11.71]
Interesting.

[00:14:13.45]
You know, we asked all
four of those original.
[00:14:16.00]
And two said yes,
and two said no.
[00:14:18.15]
And Leon said no.

[00:14:19.44]
So, you know, I'm just wondering
about the passage of time.
[00:14:24.02]
Yes.

[00:14:24.52]


[00:14:27.96]
Again, you are raising
questions that I
[00:14:31.20]
think should be studied in a
methodological, rigorous way.
[00:14:36.55]
And unfortunately, I don't
see that study happening.
[00:14:39.15]
Or maybe having the testimonies,
it will happen one day.
[00:14:42.44]


[00:14:46.13]
Well--

[00:14:46.63]
You asked me one thing
that I-- that I regretted,
[00:14:50.27]
that there's not
much more sub-facets
[00:14:54.23]
studied of the testimonies.

[00:14:56.22]
And there is--

[00:14:57.46]
Well, you need another lifetime.

[00:14:59.64]
I need another lifetime, yes.

[00:15:01.27]
For many things, I would--

[00:15:03.11]
I would accept it
with gratitude.
[00:15:06.19]
But I know what I have.

[00:15:10.70]
Now, is there anything else,
that I haven't asked, that you
[00:15:13.57]
think it's important to say?

[00:15:16.96]
I think we have covered.

[00:15:18.34]


[00:15:21.77]
Thank you for coming in today.

[00:15:23.71]
Thank you.

[00:15:25.56]


[00:16:26.45]
