        So we were just discussing<br/>
the interviewer methodology.

        to do five to seven<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.54" end="00:01:01.97" style="1">
        to me is mind-boggling.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.97" end="00:01:04.88" style="1">
        I can't imagine doing that.<br/>

        I can't imagine<br/>
the mental stamina

        And you said you swam to<br/>

      <p begin="00:01:15.41" end="00:01:18.03" style="1">
        And you talked a little bit<br/>

      <p begin="00:01:18.03" end="00:01:24.13" style="1">
        But at that point, you<br/>

        And also, five days<br/>

        as a psychiatrist, as-- as an<br/>

        yourself, how did that<br/>

      <p begin="00:01:44.02" end="00:01:45.86" style="1">
        should be interviewers?<br/>

        Of course, their own experience<br/>
is alive and awakened.

      <p begin="00:02:03.97" end="00:02:06.92" style="1">
        I think that part--<br/>

      <p begin="00:02:06.92" end="00:02:11.92" style="1">
        exans-- an example of that<br/>
is my interview of my mother,

      <p begin="00:02:11.92" end="00:02:16.50" style="1">
        that she spoke of experiences<br/>
that I was part of.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.50" end="00:02:17.48" style="1">
        And they were the same.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.48" end="00:02:20.59" style="1">
        Or they were<br/>
different, sometimes.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.59" end="00:02:25.18" style="1">
        And there was, uh, moments<br/>
in which I pointed out
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.18" end="00:02:27.13" style="1">
        the difference and<br/>
moments I kept silent,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.13" end="00:02:31.95" style="1">
        because she needed it to<br/>
tell it the way she told it.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.95" end="00:02:38.47" style="1">
        Uh, I think the survivor<br/>
herself knows whether she
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.47" end="00:02:41.58" style="1">
        could be an interviewer or not.<br/>

      <p begin="00:02:41.58" end="00:02:47.41" style="1">
        You know, if it take-- there<br/>
may be people for whom this is
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.41" end="00:02:52.61" style="1">
        so, uh, upsetting, so--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.61" end="00:02:56.53" style="1">
        uh, such-- causes such<br/>
an emotional storm,

      <p begin="00:02:56.53" end="00:02:58.16" style="1">
        that they shouldn't<br/>

      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.16" end="00:02:59.08" style="1">
        But they will know it.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.08" end="00:03:01.27" style="1">
        And they will know it,<br/>
at least till they try.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.27" end="00:03:03.98" style="1">
        And they know what-- they<br/>
find out that they do it.

      <p begin="00:03:03.98" end="00:03:07.42" style="1">
        It's-- I have a<br/>
lifelong training,

      <p begin="00:03:07.42" end="00:03:14.47" style="1">
        how to involve myself and<br/>

        And be completely<br/>

        Yes.<br/>

      <p begin="00:03:37.77" end="00:03:42.57" style="1">
        And I say this with<br/>
qualifications-- no.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.57" end="00:03:46.81" style="1">
        You have to be all the<br/>

        and to struggle with<br/>
it and to feel it.

      <p begin="00:03:49.62" end="00:03:56.94" style="1">
        And sometimes, it's terrifying<br/>

        Do, uh, particular<br/>

      <p begin="00:04:38.80" end="00:04:40.96" style="1">
        Absolutely, uh,<br/>
particularly when

      <p begin="00:04:40.96" end="00:04:46.06" style="1">
        there's terror<br/>

      <p begin="00:04:54.35" end="00:05:00.31" style="1">
        And I remember my own<br/>

      <p begin="00:05:00.31" end="00:05:05.65" style="1">

        The-- the person<br/>
interviewed feels

        better understood<br/>

        touched if they sensed that<br/>

      <p begin="00:05:21.58" end="00:05:25.34" style="1">
        So, uh, do I pay a price for it?<br/>

        What is terribly<br/>

        I think, you know, I'm free<br/>

        I think that here is how<br/>
I married [? Johanna, ?]

      <p begin="00:06:23.51" end="00:06:29.31" style="1">
        And, uh, that was<br/>
enormously empowering.

        a relatedness of the<br/>

      <p begin="00:08:40.56" end="00:08:43.56" style="1">
        than it does to go in<br/>
with a set of questions.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:08:43.56" end="00:08:45.36" style="1">
        Sure.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:08:45.36" end="00:08:47.29" style="1">
        And I'm wondering-- and--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:08:47.29" end="00:08:51.84" style="1">
        and it's risky to do what we<br/>
do, because we expose ourselves

      <p begin="00:08:51.84" end="00:08:56.46" style="1">
        to the potential of<br/>
hearing terrible--

      <p begin="00:08:56.46" end="00:08:58.44" style="1">
        I-- I-- there isn't words.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:08:58.44" end="00:09:02.43" style="1">
        There aren't words to describe<br/>
some of the experiences
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:02.43" end="00:09:04.59" style="1">
        that we've heard.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.59" end="00:09:09.43" style="1">
        But with a questionnaire,<br/>
you control that.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:09.43" end="00:09:10.75" style="1">
        So it's much less risky.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.75" end="00:09:11.25" style="1">
        Mhm.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.77" end="00:09:17.64" style="1">
        Now, do you think that, in<br/>
spite of that questionnaire,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:17.64" end="00:09:21.70" style="1">
        people can share those memories?<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.70" end="00:09:23.47" style="1">
        I think the<br/>
questionnaire is a buffer
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.47" end="00:09:25.80" style="1">
        and probably<br/>
reduces the sharing.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.80" end="00:09:32.33" style="1">
        Except that there is a<br/>
internal pressure to tell
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.33" end="00:09:37.14" style="1">
        and a yearning to be heard.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.14" end="00:09:43.06" style="1">
        So that's why, now, interviews,<br/>
simply making this available.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:43.06" end="00:09:45.97" style="1">
        It wa-- the child was born.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.97" end="00:09:51.31" style="1">
        It came out with<br/>
some help, sometimes.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:51.31" end="00:09:53.35" style="1">
        So I think that, in spite<br/>
of the questionnaire,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.35" end="00:10:02.00" style="1">
        people will speak and<br/>
say what is pressuring,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.00" end="00:10:04.01" style="1">
        because it's a relief.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:04.01" end="00:10:05.48" style="1">
        And there's this--<br/>
this yearning.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.48" end="00:10:08.33" style="1">
        And whether-- at<br/>
least, they can--
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:08.33" end="00:10:11.01" style="1">
        for them, there can<br/>
be an imaginary, uh,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:11.01" end="00:10:12.85" style="1">
        listener behind<br/>
that piece of paper,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.85" end="00:10:15.64" style="1">
        that page with the questions.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:15.64" end="00:10:21.17" style="1">
        Um, it's bo-- also likely that<br/>
the interviewer will interfere.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.17" end="00:10:25.49" style="1">
        And it's enough that you show<br/>
that you don't want to hear,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.49" end="00:10:27.14" style="1">
        and then it's all--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.14" end="00:10:30.73" style="1">
        there's no story--<br/>
there's no testimony.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.73" end="00:10:35.55" style="1">
        So, again, it-- it's<br/>
a wide spectrum.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.55" end="00:10:39.91" style="1">
        In some situations, yes, the--<br/>
something will come through.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.91" end="00:10:44.35" style="1">
        In others, it will<br/>
be chopped off.

        And so but who is the cause?<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:05.11" end="00:13:07.93" style="1">
        I think, it's also our<br/>
ways-- way of interview,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:07.93" end="00:13:09.10" style="1">
        of knowing how to interview.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.10" end="00:13:12.51" style="1">
        And it's a com-- very<br/>
more differentiated story,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:12.51" end="00:13:15.46" style="1">
        that he was not only<br/>
a-- the thief of bread
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.46" end="00:13:17.17" style="1">
        but the bread bringer.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.17" end="00:13:21.78" style="1">
        He worked in a bakery and<br/>
brought her, uh, bread, each--
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:21.78" end="00:13:25.72" style="1">
        and he used to extract the<br/>
bread through the window.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.72" end="00:13:27.91" style="1">
        And then there were grates,<br/>
so it was two sticks.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:27.91" end="00:13:30.19" style="1">
        That this cut up<br/>
the bread next time.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:30.19" end="00:13:33.68" style="1">
        So he enourished his family, not<br/>
only took bread to his family,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.68" end="00:13:34.30" style="1">
        nourished.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:34.30" end="00:13:35.47" style="1">
        This was a very different.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:35.47" end="00:13:38.68" style="1">
        So the first memory was like a<br/>
cover memory, a screen memory--
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:38.68" end="00:13:39.19" style="1">
        Mhm.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:39.19" end="00:13:42.34" style="1">
        --that didn't tell<br/>
the full memory.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:42.34" end="00:13:45.86" style="1">
        But is it Leon who has in--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:45.86" end="00:13:49.39" style="1">
        uh, integrated more,<br/>
knows more with age,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.39" end="00:13:54.93" style="1">
        or is it our interviewing that<br/>
was different 25 years later?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:54.93" end="00:13:57.94" style="1">
        That's very interesting to me,<br/>
because, when we were doing
      </p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.94" end="00:14:01.12" style="1">
        our re-interview project,<br/>
which was quite a bit earlier--
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:01.12" end="00:14:05.92" style="1">
        it was in the early to<br/>
mid-'90s-- and we asked Leon.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.92" end="00:14:07.37" style="1">
        He said no.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.37" end="00:14:07.87" style="1">
        He what?<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.87" end="00:14:08.41" style="1">
        He said?<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.41" end="00:14:09.01" style="1">
        He said no.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.01" end="00:14:09.93" style="1">
        He didn't want to<br/>
be interviewed?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.93" end="00:14:10.46" style="1">
        No.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:10.46" end="00:14:11.71" style="1">
        He wouldn't be re-interviewed.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:11.71" end="00:14:13.45" style="1">
        Interesting.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:13.45" end="00:14:16.00" style="1">
        You know, we asked all<br/>
four of those original.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:16.00" end="00:14:18.15" style="1">
        And two said yes,<br/>
and two said no.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:18.15" end="00:14:19.44" style="1">
        And Leon said no.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.44" end="00:14:24.02" style="1">
        So, you know, I'm just wondering<br/>
about the passage of time.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.02" end="00:14:24.52" style="1">
        Yes.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.96" end="00:14:31.20" style="1">
        Again, you are raising<br/>
questions that I
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:31.20" end="00:14:36.55" style="1">
        think should be studied in a<br/>
methodological, rigorous way.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.55" end="00:14:39.15" style="1">
        And unfortunately, I don't<br/>
see that study happening.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:39.15" end="00:14:42.44" style="1">
        Or maybe having the testimonies,<br/>
it will happen one day.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.13" end="00:14:46.63" style="1">
        Well--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:46.63" end="00:14:50.27" style="1">
        You asked me one thing<br/>
that I-- that I regretted,
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.27" end="00:14:54.23" style="1">
        that there's not<br/>
much more sub-facets
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.23" end="00:14:56.22" style="1">
        studied of the testimonies.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.22" end="00:14:57.46" style="1">
        And there is--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.46" end="00:14:59.64" style="1">
        Well, you need another lifetime.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.64" end="00:15:01.27" style="1">
        I need another lifetime, yes.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:01.27" end="00:15:03.11" style="1">
        For many things, I would--<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:03.11" end="00:15:06.19" style="1">
        I would accept it<br/>
with gratitude.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:06.19" end="00:15:10.70" style="1">
        But I know what I have.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:10.70" end="00:15:13.57" style="1">
        Now, is there anything else,<br/>
that I haven't asked, that you
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.57" end="00:15:16.96" style="1">
        think it's important to say?<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:16.96" end="00:15:18.34" style="1">
        I think we have covered.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:21.77" end="00:15:23.71" style="1">
        Thank you for coming in today.<br/>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:15:23.71" end="00:15:25.56" style="1">
