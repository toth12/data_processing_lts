We had, and it was all government left Poland, but what to do? Poland was not prepared for war, because we had only twa – 20 years to start to be alone, not divided between our friends, Germany and Russia. Therefore, it was completely too hard even understand why, because Russia is so big [indecipherable] they came first of September came Germany, without telling that we start to – to fight and this is beginning of war. They came, killing as much as possible, bombarding ne – it was a really very hard time. But 17 days later, our friend from Russia came to divide some part for themself.

What happened after that, to your family?  Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 18 A: It was very difficult to find bread, because even this places was bombarding them, people couldn’t do nothing, and they didn’t have even flour. Therefore, I remember that my sister – my brother, the oldest, was in an organization which prepared for, from school, after finishing school, high school, and they start to – they send them to – to Lithuanian, I think. These young people. It was very difficult to be there because they wanted to take Polish boys to Russia. And he came v-very – without permission of course, he came back to Warsaw.

A: Oh, when I saw first time, I was shocked, because these people looked for me like – because I romantic and I suppose it – like [indecipherable] coming on [indecipherable] with an [indecipherable] and with – and these faces was for me it was terrible shock. But these people who were just sitting in our cellar, everybody was very unhappy because they couldn’t go even to family, because on the street, Germany was ba – very bad to everybody. Q: Did you see, at that time, any people who were killed? Did you see any dead bodies on the streets? A: You see, yes, I saw. One part of this house where we were living was bombarding and couple people were dead. But everybody was so shocked and unhappy and afraid of life. Q: Was this the first time you had seen somebody who was dead? A: You see – Q: Or was killed, actually? A: Yes. They usually were many people pay – after bombarding they lost life in houses. But I don’t remember – for example, for me it was very painful to see how  Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 20 parl – parlay(ph) of our – our king was in fire, and falling down, and I was crying, because I was – my first years I spent so often in this – this park, across the zarek(ph). This is like the mi – nicest Polish – Q: Well, I’m trying to imagine what it is like for an 11 year old child to have all these things happening around her. A: Everything fo – was tense, everybody was without an idea what to do. Not food, and no – and people hungry, without families. Everybody lost some – some other people. Q: What were you most frightened of? A: I believe I was so close with family that I tr – I – thing that my parents do everything for us. I wasn’t st – in this time I was not conscious even what does it mean? But for me i-is very hurt by to see [indecipherable] mother, how my father were hol – helping other. Q: How did things develop? You mentioned earlier that your father’s factory had to make something for the Germans. What was it? A: It was ni – necessary, if s – some factories do something, then government didn’t – government wanted to take some part for them. Q: Okay. A: And it was very difficult to do that. Q: So, if I understand it properly, your father still was able to keep his business.  Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 21 A: Still, but that is it was not so good as before. Q: Okay, and – and yet, he had to probably pay either heavy taxes, or give many of the goods up to the Germans. A: Of course. Q: Okay, okay. How did life develop for your family, for you and your family, how did life change? A: A – you see this five – five years was very, very difficult, because was very short of food. Light was only for a couple hours and other place, and then [indecipherable] and we h-have use [indecipherable]. It – it was very, very, very smell – smelling, but instead of light, because light. And food was for people, for example, we can buy, but bread was like greener, like something old, some ny – not – not good, of course. And it – food was only [indecipherable] for eat. If somebody wants to eat, should buy from other people who brought from the country. They kill animal and they bring in. But it was very expensive. Some people really almost dying from hunger. But still, for us, my mother had a difficult to – to get it. And especially giving us lot of sa-salad, green salad, and sauerkraut we made at home, is also – and each Sunday, ea-each morning it was make place with cebula. Q: With onions? A: Onion, onion. Q: With onions, mm-hm.  Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 22 A: Cut onion in oil, and it was very good against [indecipherable] or something. Q: Yeah.

Q: Yes, but let’s go – I – I – I’d like to understand how life developed, and what happened in your family, where you eventually ended up in concentration camp. Explain this to me. How did things happen, how long were you still in Warsaw? What were you most afraid of, you see. A: I tell you. In Warsaw was very dangerous, because they keep people from the street, take to concentration camp or to work in Germany, because a soldier were fighting, therefore, for work, they took lot of Polish people. And a lack – lack of food st-stress, because everybody was afraid that they could take me in any minute. Schools was closed. [indecipherable] Only they let – they let to have school for – to – to – maybe for – for class, and that’s it. The idea was to keep Polish people as – only to work, like – no. Q: Okay, I – A: You understand?  Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 23 Q: So – I hope I do, if I will say it in this way, that only children up to fourth – four classes were allowed to go to school, and otherwise all the schools in the country were closed. A: Yes. Q: And it was considered that they’re not necessary because all the Poles are good for is going to be to work for the Germans. A: Yes, it – therefore we had, always living afraid that somebody come, go, and arrest for nothing. In – since this operation start, underground start to work [indecipherable] people start to fight for freedom. And regarding me, I tell you that I lost my childhood, because all the time I was thinking, what I can do for my country. I was 12 - 13 - 14 - 15. But I was too young. I suppose that my older siblings, they probably were in organization, therefore I do what is possible and thank God that my girlfriend was also of the same kind of family [indecipherable] Q: Which girlfriend is this? Which girlfriend is this? A: Is – Mishka(ph), like mouse. And she was – she lost a father who was dentist, because he was in an underground and they dis-dissolved this, they keeped, and he’s – he killed him. And so many people was killing without – probably maybe they do something against Nazis. Q: Mm-hm, the Nazis.  Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 24 A: Yes, of course, and we’re afraid because we – it was seven o’clock, everybody has to be at home. Light very – not always, food very poor, and only I – we couldn’t have radio. Everybody, if ki – kept radio, could be killed because they afraid of trouble, and so many people was without food, without place for live, taking – seeing something on the street, and asking for money. Q: How did – A: This fight – Q: Yeah. A: This five years was depression, and so many people so unhappy and dying, and sort of – we had always this – somebody sending to concentration camp. Q: All right, so explain now. A: And you know, this situation, wha-what’s happened with me? I was ma – dreaming to kill, in this age to kill German. I was hoping that is comes today that we can – they have to go to own. And in the – my friend, I – I told you, Mishka(ph), she took – she tried to take me to organization, and it was organization I didn’t know even what kind organization, but somebody – I’m looking all who can fight with Germany. I suppose it’s my part – my – my parents helped German – Jewish people, but my brother oldest, second brother was in – ah, sorry, it’s too, too far.

Interview with Wanda Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 25 Q: But your family – you – you didn’t know if your parents were, or if your brothers were, or your sister – A: No, because this is – I oath never talk, and even save – give my life for freedom of Poland.
