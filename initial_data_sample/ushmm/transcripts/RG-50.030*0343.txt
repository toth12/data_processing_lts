So there were four of   RG-50.030*0343 44 us. We have to go four, like military. I was always between the four. I was shaved. We had this shaving cream from maybe a hundred years old, but you rubbed your face. You rubbed, you rubbed and dry, only to look like—on the road, we met Russian prisoners of war, alone. They left already. (Inaudible). And we came—the first stop was that school, a village, that school. There’s an empty school which is ____________ with military. It’s no school anymore. So it was Slovaks living, Slovaks. They brought us soup, _________. There was steps up, and so the soup was upstairs, and someone would give it to everybody. I don’t know so much. So going up, one hit the other one by coincidence, and this other one lost his plate with the soup. So this guy said, who did it? He said, the sergeant, he said—I talk about somebody which I’ll tell you a story about, a guy by the name _________. That was his name. (Inaudible). He was my age. He said, come. He said, not me, him, you know, by impulse, not me, it was he, because he was a good man. He took out the other guy and killed him, and he survived all the way. The story with them I told you about after September 9, the September first or the second came a group of people who were found that _________. So here was this man, his wife and a child. The registration of this group was not done. The group was brought to us. We shall register. (Inaudible). A few senior people usually would go to the crematory because of age. You have women with small children who would go to the crematory because of the small children. We have them here. So you can talk to them. You can tell. So I started to talk to—not to him, but to his wife and tell her, tell her. I said, when he would come, a doctor, which is a military man, and I would suggest he will ask, is that your child? Don’t say it’s yours. Don’t tell them it’s yours. It’s possible they would take away the child, but you would survive. If you will keep the child, you will not survive. You will go and the child will go. So it’s a question. I said according to my feelings, you have to give away the child only to survive because the Germans want to kill you too. So they did. And she did it this way. She let the child go, and the child— and this couple, both of them, after the war, met and went to Israel. But he had on his conscience that somebody—he meant—he couldn’t—he gave away the child. (Inaudible). He put her before a dilemma. Q: A lot of difficult choices?   RG-50.030*0343 45 A: Sure. Sure. So we walked so long, from the assessment with us. He had civilian clothes under his uniform, and this son-of-a-gun found out, and he killed him. So the mayor from the village notified the army, German soldier, the sergeant _________. The morning came, the military police came, got us all together and said, now you are not anymore under _________ jurisdiction. We will take care of you, the army. The army took us to a place called __________. It’s—what is it? It’s another camp. We worked over there underground. They were making parts for tanks. This is already February. The Germans are still making parts of tanks. Here are sitting people underground. This was murder. The Pollacks, they were beating us up, because we came as old inmates. I had such a career of three years already. They just gave us a hard time and so on. Also, one day, must have been an order not to make any tanks anymore for the army, so we were all assembled in the morning. All from the 320 remained some 80 or 70, because the rest are somewhere on the road. Q: They died along the way? A: They died. They were killed. He shot them. So no more Gestapo, only the army. (Inaudible). All the Jewish step out. When he said, Jews step out, I said to myself, I am not a Jew. I also—my friend—I had a friend with me. He said, you will go with me. Let’s go. I made a mistake. I know. So the non-Jews were taken to a transport, a transport which was on its way to ___________ mountains. Auschwitz, the liquidation of Auschwitz inmates, that we found out later, but this transport was standing and waiting for more people between ___________ the non-Jews over there. The others were taken to 3__________. It was only ten kilometers from ___________. ___________ was a Jewish and we didn’t know about the history that the commandant of __________ refused, which was an assessment, refused to kill the people.

This man and his friend and 18 other people, this transport, after two days on the road, seven kilometers a day the train was going, we came to a place and I said to my friend, even if this transport was stopped some in Czechoslovakian territory, I’ll jump. I’ll not go to the end. They not take us to sanatoriums or something. They take us for liquidation. It’s only ten percent. We have ten percent a chance. We have   RG-50.030*0343 46 already 19. We have ten percent. (Inaudible). The local population was a big railroad station, a lot of empty railroads on the tracks, railroad wagons and so on, and I see people jump, jumping and running, jumping from the train. (Inaudible). There were hills, and they’re running up. So I said to someone, the SS was busy with soups. The local community brought all kinds of soup and fed and, you know—so I jumped, and my friend jumped, and we went in one of the railroad wagons, empty and was there as long until about an hour or two hours later. The transport moved, and we stayed here. And came in some local miners it was mine territory—and said, wait here. We will bring you clothes. Some men will come, and we will pick you up, and we will bring you to some other place. After an hour, we had clothes. We had normal clothes. And he was going, the men, taking.

People on the floor. I knew right away that we were with KGB. I saw the people were shot down. These were Russians with the big suitcases. They robbed from the Germans and so on.

The next day came out an old—brought a little desk and started to make a list of people and the names and so on, and I saw right away—I knew Russian. I knew what it is. It’s written list of arrested people or something like that. So anyway, they took me another 24 hours. When it came to _________, I said, I’m not Russian, I’m Polish. I’m from Warsaw, and I want to go home. You want to go home? Go to hell. Go. Now I want to go to Prague. I didn’t go home. I went to Prague. Prague is a Jewish community, and I’m sure after the war, they’re taking care of—maybe Suzy is back. That’s this woman. So here is another—so   RG-50.030*0343 47 there was not a railroad station. The train goes normal to Prague. It was not far from Prague too. May 9, May 9, yes, we were still in the mines, and they came, Czechoslovakians, so happy you’re here. Go.
