SUBJECT: Mhm. 

CREW: OK. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. 

SUBJECT: Oh, so, n-- in the-- in June, I-- '49 I came to Israel. And because I-- I didn't know here anybody, so I was in-- in Bethlehem near Haifa the first time, the first few days. I was working, as I told you, in tracking the Jewish orphanage. I was working with the-- with the small children. 

[HONK] 

Say, I had children from 4 to-- to 12. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did they survive? 

SUBJECT: They were some-- some were in-- in some convents. Two childrens, three childrens, I had say, stayed in Theresienstadt till-- till the end. And then they found them and brought them. It was always a-- it was a Jewish school before the war. So I-- I worked with the small children. But the big ones lived there too. And I lived there. So I was in contact with the bigger ones. There were boys and girls about 16, 17, till 18. 

[HONK] 

For 18 olds there was another house. So they went to this kibbutz. And they found me. It was very near Haifa. And they found me in this beyt olim. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Kibbutz. 

SUBJECT: And they took me to the kibbutz. And I spoke to the mazkir to the-- and they took me on. So I stayed there. But it was all right. I liked it. But I was the oldest, even from the old ones that were there from-- from-- I don't know-- from 40 or from 38 or 39. I was the oldest from the-- from older [CHUCKLES] people. 

So after two years, I-- I decided to go. I had a friend on Mount Carmel. And she found me a place to take care of a little girl in a family with-- with a sleeping in. So that solved my problems of-- of-- of a flat, because I had no one, no money and flats. 

So I stayed there for a few months. And then I-- I-- I went to an other family with two children. And I stayed there for many years till the children grow up. They are like my sons till-- till now. We are still very, very close. And then I worked in-- in their shop. 

Later, I-- when I got money from the Germans, I got a pension after my husband, I quitted work and went for five months to a Ulpan to learn properly Hebrew, because I learned always in the evenings after work. So I went for five hours a day. And then I worked in their shop as a cashier. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Are you happy here in Israel? 

SUBJECT: Very happy, very happy. Now, I am not working anymore, only without money. I work now for two years in a kindergarten in a shkhuna, in Mahane David. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In the neighborhood? 

SUBJECT: Yes, Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Volunteer work. 

SUBJECT: And-- Hm? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You do volunteer work. 

SUBJECT: Volunteer work, yes, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ever think of-- about getting married?

SUBJECT: Yeah? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Go ahead. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Go ahead. 

SUBJECT: It's all right? Ah. So you-- you want to know the story of the clothing in Auschwitz. We had to go always after two, three days to the entlausung. So we didn't have lice because we didn't have any hair. But that was it. So we had to go to-- 

[INAUDIBLE] 

CREW: Sorry. 

SUBJECT: --to where. 

CREW: I'm sorry. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Wait a minute. 

SUBJECT: Ah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: There's too much noise. 

CREW: We could hide this. 

INTERVIEWER 2: We can't-- 

[THUD] 

Some funny thing. 

SUBJECT: In Auschwitz, there were some funny things that happened to us, too. So when we went to the Entlausung, they took all our clothes away. And when we went through the-- the barrack, on the other end, they gave us some clothes. We didn't know what it was. And we went back to our barrack. And then we could see what it was. So once I got a-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: You were all undressed? 

SUBJECT: We were undressed, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Wet? 

SUBJECT: We had to wait outside with the clothes on our hand. And then in the-- in the door of the barrack, they took them away. And then we went through. They were three showers, I think. But we didn't got the shower. We did throw little water we get. And on the other hand, we got the clothes, and we went back. Because we-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: You were naked. 

SUBJECT: Naked. We couldn't wait, because always, you had to run. So we went back to the barrack. And there, we could see what we got. It were-- it were always old things. And so once I came back, and I looked what I had. So I got a winter jacket, a very nice one, a lumberjack, and some short combination. And that was all. So-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: You mean a short vest, or-- 

SUBJECT: No, no. What-- what do you wear under-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: It's a--

So she saw it. She said, how can you go like this? So I said, that's what I got yesterday at the entlausung. So she took me inside and sent for something and gave me something to-- to wear till the next time. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You weren't humiliated? You thought it was funny? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You didn't feel humiliation?
