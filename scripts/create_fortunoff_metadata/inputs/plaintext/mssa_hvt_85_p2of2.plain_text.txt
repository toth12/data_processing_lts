SUBJECT 1: Everything, what I built up. 

CREW: [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But to build up, you need something to build on. 

SUBJECT 1: This is true because you can't go just with the shield. 

CREW: Roll 19. I mean, tape 19. 

SUBJECT 1: You can't go with a shield in the center. Because, because, because of this, I am so much disturbed. And then you have to believe me. Nobody wants to hear this. So you have to build up yourself. How I managed. 

CREW: Rolling. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you manage? 

SUBJECT 1: I-- I think this came because I am very proud. It's by nature. And I really didn't want nobody to-- to-- to pity me. So instead to cry and to-- so I built up my personality to be very strong, to-- to appear very strong. And nobody has to-- to be very sorry for me. 

INTERVIEWER 2: In-- in the convent, though, what were you feeling? 

SUBJECT 1: I will tell you, in the convent, it was very nice, because the nuns are very nice people. They-- they-- very nice to me. It was really-- and there came a Polish family. And they wanted even to adopt me, because they saw that I am Polish child and I am an orphan. I didn't know how to get out from it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Is that what everybody thought about you?

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you think the nuns would do if they knew? 

SUBJECT 1: They will throw me out. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were there other Jewish children there? 

SUBJECT 1: I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Nobody told you? Did you think about being Jewish? 

SUBJECT 1: It was a time-- I must be-- true that I didn't want to be Jewish. And I really-- this is the thing-- I was praying to Jesus Christ. And I believed that he will help me, because I was talking to him. I remember the picture. It was a picture of Maria and Jesus Christ. The sandal is felling down from his leg, from the-- and I was praying every night. And I believed-- I was begging on him to help me. 

And even when I came to Israel, I was in between youths. I was waiting till everybody will fell asleep. And I was going down to pray. 

INTERVIEWER 1: On your knees? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. I really believed in it. And I really wanted to-- I didn't want to be Jewish. I didn't want to be Jewish because they killed every Jewish child.

INTERVIEWER 2: Why? 

SUBJECT 1: Because I was different. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You knew it, or they knew it?

INTERVIEWER 2: The children said this? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What about the nuns, the sisters? 

SUBJECT 1: No. The children from the street. They said, you have Jewish eyes. I don't know how they-- but the Polish people, they could say exactly who is Jewish and who is not. 

INTERVIEWER 2: In the convent, the other children, did they say this too? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. Why you have such a Jewish eyes? 

INTERVIEWER 2: What did you say? 

SUBJECT 1: I don't know. How do I know? 

INTERVIEWER 2: When your aunt came, where were you? 

SUBJECT 1: I was again in Krakow. I was every day coming to look to the Jewish community, if somebody is alive. Everybody was coming to the Jewish community to see. And one day, I came, and I saw my aunt. So I-- I took her by the skirt, and I didn't I want her to move from one-- one centimeter. He had to go with me. I was afraid that she will leave me. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Why did you go to the Jewish community? You didn't want to be Jewish. You were trying not to be Jewish. 

SUBJECT 1: Yes, but I wanted to find my father. I knew that my father was alive when I left him. So I wanted to find my father. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did your aunt have anyone left? 

SUBJECT 1: My aunt stayed with her whole family. She ran away to-- to Hungarian. They ran away from Poland to Hungarian through-- through Slovakia, and I don't know how. It was complicated. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But she came back to Krakow to look for people? 

SUBJECT 1: To look-- and she had also a mother-in-law. She left by Polish people. But she was dead. The German found her and the kid. They killed her, and the-- and the owner who hold her. It was the whole story. I found-- I found my aunt, and I was very happy. But didn't last long. It was very difficult for me. Nobody wanted-- it was difficult after the war. Nobody wanted to hold an orphan, not even an aunt. 

So they sent me to Israel. And the word "Israel," for me, it was very strange. I was afraid, very much. Israel-- where is Israel? And I was alone again without no relatives. But this was my luck. I came to Israel. I was sent to Ben Shemen. This was a children farm, and it was a man there. He was a teacher. He was a great man. He was Dr. Jacobson, named. He was a great psychiatrist. And he really, he took me, and he-- he took care of me.
