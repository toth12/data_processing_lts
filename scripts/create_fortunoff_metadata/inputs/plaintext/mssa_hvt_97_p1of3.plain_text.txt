CREW: We're rolling. 

WALTER KARLINER: This picture was taken out of the porthole. In fact, I took that picture with a little box camera from the St. Louis facing our relatives that came to call us on the-- call and they sand manana, tomorrow. Every day as they came, they said, manana, tomorrow you'll come down. And I took that picture. In fact, I have another one at home like that. 

In background you see is the city of Havana. That was in the port and the-- the port is quite a large circle there somehow. The ship was right in the middle and there was policemen there-- you know, the Cuban police was there watching us when we couldn't land. And that is a picture from that. It came out very good. It doesn't look that clear on the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your uncle was there on the shore? 

WALTER KARLINER: I had an uncle, a dentist. He was-- he's in Paris, France now. A dentist, he's from Breslau. That was taken-- I don't know who took it. This was taken-- you know, the St. Louis was the name of it, the ships and all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was this an American ship? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. It was a German ship by the Haapag Lloyd company of Hamburg, Germany. And by the way, we had to-- by the way, we had to buy tickets-- round trip tickets in case we couldn't land to go back. This is me in front on the ship. That's in front and in back is my little sister, Ruth. And where this was taken, I don't remember. It looks like the port of I don't know, Hamburg or Le Havre or someplace. Because we stopped in La Havre before we went on. We picked up more passengers in Le Havre, France. 

INTERVIEWER 2: We were in France. Then again, my husband was in the army. And we were in La Rochelle. We often went to Poitiers. 

WALTER KARLINER: Poitiers 

INTERVIEWER 2: I know. That's where I used to go. 

WALTER KARLINER: Isn't that something? 

INTERVIEWER 2: And our best friend was the rabbi in the American Army in Poitiers. 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. That's-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: We're going back to the other page. 

WALTER KARLINER: So that-- say it again. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. That-- this is fine, Edward. It's the other one that we didn't have on the other page. If you-- 

WALTER KARLINER: In each picture-- on each I marked it in back what it is, actually-- for you, I mean, you know, the collection you see. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But it's better you tell me. How old was your sister there? 

WALTER KARLINER: Oh, she was-- wait a minute. She was four years younger than I am. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Could you describe this again? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. This was taken out of the porthole of the ship St. Louis on-- in front of us the people, our friends and relatives came, and hollered to us, manana, manana, tomorrow you'll come down. On the back you see the city of Havana, Cuba. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They're on what, you friends and relatives? 

WALTER KARLINER: It's hard to describe, but I know I took them because I was there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But are those boats? 

WALTER KARLINER: On-- on that boat. On this boat, I don't know which one-- I-- I-- probably the first one there on the right-- on the right hand side. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So where were you? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, that was taken in France. And that's me in the French underground in 1943. And I was in the French underground and that was the uniform we had. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Would you say that again? That was you? 

WALTER KARLINER: This was taken in 1943 when I was in the French underground. This was the uniform we used to wear. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they know you were Jewish? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. No. The-- the pictures come out excellent. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Wonderful. 

WALTER KARLINER: I can't believe-- it's better than the real picture. Well, this was taken on the ship. Some of my brother's friends and my friends. The pictures come out excellent. I can't believe it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What are we waiting for? 

CREW: I'm waiting for somebody to come back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Whitney? 

CREW: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Going back. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I used to go to Landour. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I've never been. 

WALTER KARLINER: Oh. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Wait. Wait. Wait till he tells you to speak. I want to activate both machines so the machine-- 

WALTER KARLINER: Yeah, but I'm not-- well, I'm almost there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well, you tell us when you're ready to speak. 

WALTER KARLINER: My uncle is-- I'm on the side, my brother is there, and there's our uncle-- my uncle the dentist that's in France now. He's-- I can see him. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Where does he live in France? 

WALTER KARLINER: Paris. He was a dentist in Germany, Breslau. 

INTERVIEWER 1: All right. We have to be quiet so that you can speak about this. 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, first of all, I don't see my uncle which is on the-- they don't show the whole picture. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can we pull back, Craig, to see the whole picture? 

WALTER KARLINER: My uncle is on this side. Yeah. That's it. Again he's not there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who else is in this picture? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, on that picture is-- in front is Mr. And Mrs. Spitz. These are some relatives of ours. On the left-- on the right corner there is Mr. Spitz. On the upper right is me, Walter. and on the left, there is my brother, Herbert. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where was this? 

WALTER KARLINER: And that was taken on the ship on the voyage from Germany towards Cuba, which was very-- it was a happy occasion because we expected to land. The voyage from Germany towards Cuba was very happy for all of us because we expected to land and so on. The voyage back was something different again. Ah, here's my uncle. that's my-- that's my sister, Ilse, on this ship. She was-- at that time, she was 16 years old. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This was going to Cuba? 

WALTER KARLINER: That was going to Cuba. On the way back, I don't think I have any pictures of her. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You knew what you were escaping. 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes, but we didn't know what was waiting for us. Now is my mother. Yeah. This is my mother on your left and my sister, Ilse, on the right laying on our couch. That's also pictures taken on the voyage between Hamburg and Cuba on the voyage towards Cuba. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And give the year, sir. 

WALTER KARLINER: It was 1939. All of it was 1939. OK. This was my little sister, Ruth, on the ship St. Louis in 1939-- May 1939. How old she could have been? I was 14. About 10 years old. Oh, the second-- this is my father. The second person, the male on that picture, from left is my father, Joseph. The third person is my sister, Ilse. 

And way in back there with that hat, the lady with the hat was my mother, Martha. And that was boarding the ship in Hamburg, Germany. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who took the picture? 

WALTER KARLINER: This was taken by the German, uh, people that-- you know, to sell pictures on the- aboard. And in that book, he sees pictures like that, too. That's my father and my sister boarding the ship in Hamburg. Can they hear my voice on there? OK. 

CREW: We're going to do one where a second chair. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. 

CREW: Just wait five or 10 seconds. OK. We're rolling. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. Mr. Karliner, can you sit down and identify the photograph? 

WALTER KARLINER: I don't know the year this was taken. It's-- it's my Hebrew school. That's the-- the rabbi, the teacher of Hebrew classes. I am on the bottom right and my sister, Ilse, is next to me. And a cousin of mine is the first-- first person on your left. That's a cousin of mine. She passed away in the war. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did she pass away? 

WALTER KARLINER: In a concentration camp. The pictures are mixed up now, but that's all right. This was taken-- I was-- after the war, I was a trainer. I also worked for the Ort, and I was a cabinetmaker. And we were staying in that home, in that house. It was called Moulin-- Moul-- Le Moulin. And that was in the southern part of France. And this was owned by the Eclaireurs Israel-- Israelites de France, the French Jewish Boy Scouts, this picture. 

There was about 250 Jewish boys and girls. It was a kosher home, by the way. This was taken in '46-- '45, '46. Actually, it's a postcard. Now, should I wait 10-- 10 seconds? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Go ahead. 

WALTER KARLINER: This was in 1939-1940 in Chateau de Chemons. That was a home of-- for Jewish refugee children. And we went out on a picnic. My brother is on the-- the first on the right on the bottom and I'm on the upper part, the second on your left with the white pants. Now, this was taken in France. This is my sister, Ilse, on your right, and my sister, Ruth, on your left. And this was taken in France 1940-41 probably. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This was after the ship? 

WALTER KARLINER: This was after the-- in France was after the ship. because the ship was in 1939. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened to them? 

WALTER KARLINER: They was deported with my parents and never returned. In 1942 they was-- until 1942 we heard from them and then they was deported and never-- we never heard from them. This is my mother, my father, and my oldest sister, Ilse. This was taken in-- I guess in Poitiers, France. I figure 1940-- 1939, 1940, I would guess. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who took the picture? 

WALTER KARLINER: I don't know. I was in the children's home while they was living in Poitiers. I-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why were they taken away after this? 

WALTER KARLINER: Because my parents couldn't take care of us. When we arrived in France, my parents could not take care of us. So we was put-- the-- the younger ones, we was put in a children's home by the Osee and my sister was too old for the home so she stayed with my parents. My little sister was with us, too, but she was very homesick so my parents took her back. And if she would have stayed with us, probably she would be alive today. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened to your parents after this? 

WALTER KARLINER: They was deported to Drancy and I never heard from them. This is me in France. I think it was taken in 1944, almost the end of the war. I don't know which town it was taken in so I don't remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were living on false papers? 

WALTER KARLINER: I was still living on false papers. Oh, that's very-- this is taken-- I better wait. I'm sorry. This was taken in Germany Peitskretsham, Silesia. I guess probably 1934. In back of our house, we had horses and we loved horses. I am in back of the horse, my brother is in front, and my two sisters are next-- standing next to the horse. And my Uncle Walter-- I remember that for some reason, my Uncle Walter after whom I was named took that picture. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old were you there? 

WALTER KARLINER: Probably-- I don't know. I might have been eight, nine years old. No, maybe 10 years old or so, probably. Uh-- I better wait. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hold on. 

WALTER KARLINER: No, it's-- oh, now it's right. This was taken in-- I guess in Poitiers, France, I would guess 1940, maybe '41. My parents and my two sisters. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where were they living? 

WALTER KARLINER: In Poitiers, France. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But where? They were not prisoners, they were not-- 

WALTER KARLINER: No. This was before the-- the-- France was already occupied but they were still free until 1942. By the way, my parents was in the occupied zone while I was in the children's home in the free zone. There was two zones in France. We was a baby. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were your parents allowed to live freely? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes, they was. Yes. This is me and my brother coming here. Yeah. This is me and my brother on the ship SS John Ericsson when we arrived to America. It was taken on the ship by somebody. And I'm on your left, my brother is on the right. You can see the clothes we had on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where was your brother during the war? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, he was-- first he was with me in the children's home. And after they came to try to get us, the police, we ran away and he was working in a farm. He was-- he was more steady than me. He was staying in a farm mostly while I traveled back and forth all the time. 

CREW: We're rolling. 

WALTER KARLINER: Should I? This is my false papers that's actually survived. Through that paper I survived France and maybe my life. Uh, it was given to me by the French underground. Everything is false on that paper. They changed my name from Walter Karliner to Paul Kiener. They made me a little younger. 

And I was born in France, dans le Vosges which is Alsace-Lothringen because I had a German accent and that made me some kind of a-- it made me easier to identify because of my speaking French with the German accent. And that-- that paper-- I had the paper for four years. I used it for four years in France. 

CREW: Can we get the front cover of his passport? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Sure. 

WALTER KARLINER: That-- that's another one. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Go ahead. 

WALTER KARLINER: But I don't remember that. If I see the back. Which one is it, the Jewish-- from the Jewish organization? No. This was taken for the Jeunesse. This was taken by the Jeunesse, uh, France. I was hiding there and I had to have some identification and that is the paper. It's called the Moison Nouvelle, and I was working there as a carpenter- no, as a-- apprentice, carpenter apprentice. 

And that was near Limoges, France. Yeah. That-- that-- that's also-- no. Saint Junien. This was given to me by the Eclaireurs Israelites de France I see on the stamp there. And also the identification was still the same-- the false papers, my false name, and so on. Maybe I spoke too early. Should I--? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You have to hold on a minute. 

WALTER KARLINER: I-- I said it already what I had to say. 

CREW: Yeah. We just wanted to straighten the picture. It was too crooked at first. 

INTERVIEWER 1: It's good. We're-- just like I like it now 

CREW: Is there a shot you want us to do that we haven't done yet on this? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Pardon? No, it's right there. There you've got it. 

CREW: OK. We'll hold that. For a bit. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You know what a fantastic cutaway. 

WALTER KARLINER: Saint Junien is very close to Limoges, France. That's where they make the fine china. In fact-- oh, that's now. That's my brother. Maybe I'll wait. What's the snow on-- on the jacket? I took that last year. She's French, by the way. She also was in a children's home. That little one, she looks so much like my little sister that-- and she acts like her, too. That's better now. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Would you say all that? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yeah. But there was no [INAUDIBLE]. I guess it's-- this is my brother in Florida-- north Miami, Florida, with his wife. And my niece on your left is Michelle, on your right this is Debbie Karliner. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you said Debbie reminds you-- 

WALTER KARLINER: Debbie reminds me and everybody else of my little sister, Ruth, which I lost. I have some baby pictures of both of them at home and there's such a resemblance. Everybody says it. I should-- I have a big picture of my little sister and then I have one of her as babies. And they look so much-- it-- it's-- Carte d'identite, that's-- that's-- that's a carte d'identite I already identified, the French one. 

That's the carte d'identite I already identified which saved my-- it was-- I had it all through-- during the war. 

CREW: I think we're good. I think we got all of them, didn't we? 

WALTER KARLINER: OK. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I want to start with the store and the 18,000 people and the 100 Jewish-- you know all of that, everything that's here leading up to it. 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, my name is Walter Karliner. I was born in Germany, Peiskretscham. That's the state of Silesia, Germany, near the Polish border. I was born August 11, 1924. And I was born in my parents'-- in the house where my parents was-- my father was born and my grandparents was born, too. It was a very old, old house. 

My father used to have a grocery store. It was a grocery store that his grand-- his father used to run. And it was-- it used to be very successful. We deal mostly with farmers. The farmers bought our groceries and we sold them fertilizers and, uh, grain-- no. We made exchanges. They gave us grain and we gave them fertilizers in return and so on. And, uh, the city where I was born was about 18,000 people. It was near Gliwice, Germany. Actually, this is-- Gliwice is where the Second World War started. 

And we had a-- my father had a very good income. He also had-- he also was a merchant of horses. He bought and sold horses with a partner. And, uh, I had four-- I had two sisters and a brother. And, uh, the Jewish population in my town was about I would say 80 or 100 people-- I guess families or people. And we had a large synagogue because at one time, that town had a population of maybe 250, 300 Jewish families. 

But by 1930-35, the population subsided. People started to emigrate and so on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, because I guess people moved away in the '30s. Times was hard in the '30s, I guess. I was a child, I didn't know. In-- in the '30s, they had the German, uh, the inflation where everything was so high and people moved away to bigger cities or some people moved to-- I remember to South America and other places. And I had my bar mitzvah was in 1936. It was a very big thing for us. 

My parents invited about 140, 150 people to that bar mitzvah. And it was a big day for me. And-- well, anyway. At that time already Hitler was in existence and I had trouble. I was in a class of 55 German boys. Because in Germany, there was only-- the classes was only for boys or girls. They wasn't-- they was not together, you know. 

And, uh, I was the only Jew in my class. And I was quite discriminated about, you know. Some boys spit on me, they told me the dirty Jew and things like that as a child. And, uh-- I 1930s. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Let-- let me go back a little bit in time. You were in school with non-Jewish youngsters, boys and you had-- you suffered discrimination. Do you remember the having to say Heil Hitler or salute or anything like that? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, yes. But I did not have to say it because me as a Jew, they would not allow me to say heil Hitler and all these things. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you feel about not being allowed? 

WALTER KARLINER: I-- as a child, I couldn't understand it. Because the boys that I went to school with, they was marching, doing-- you know, marching in parades, they do-- did different-- they went to different sporting events. I could not go. I could not go swimming because I was a Jew. I was discriminated about. I could not go to a movie because they didn't allow any-- any Jews into the movie house. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did they know you were Jewish? 

WALTER KARLINER: In a small town, everybody knew us-- everybody. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your teachers, how did they treat you? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: And when did the differences begin? 

WALTER KARLINER: I don't remember which year it was. I was in school and we had-- I had one teacher, he was a very short fellow-- and he was Protestant, by the way-- and he was very, uh, he was a Nazi already. Everybody knew about it. And for no reason at all, or one day because I did something wrong-- I didn't fill out the papers right-- and so he hit me with a stick. And, uh-- I-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old were you? 

WALTER KARLINER: Maybe 11, 12 years old. So he hit me for no reason at all. I came home and I showed my parents my whole derriere was-- you could see the streaks of the way he hit me. My parents wanted to go to the police and complain about it, but as I said, there no-- there was no sense to do it because they couldn't do anything about it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who said there was no sense? 

WALTER KARLINER: My parents because the police wouldn't have done anything about it. There was no reason to hit me like that. I'll never forget it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: It is still painful for you to think about. 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes, it is. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I know it's painful, but I want to talk about it a little more, if we could. He hit you with what? 

WALTER KARLINER: They had these long sticks, uh, wooden sticks. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Which were used for? 

WALTER KARLINER: They was hitting the children usually when they was punished. Most of them was hit on the hand like that. But he hit me on my behind, on my derriere. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In front of other children? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. The whole class. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did he say? What did you say? 

WALTER KARLINER: I was crying. And when I got home, I-- I-- I didn't know. My-- it-- I was blue-- red and blue all over. And there was no reason for it. In fact, I like to mention that the principal of our school, he was very tall, very nice German principal. He was in the First World War, he was an officer. And I-- my parents told him about it. But he says, yes-- he was very nice, he was a good man-- he says, I can do nothing about it. He was very good to me and the class and other Jewish-- I do remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did he say why he couldn't do anything about it? 

WALTER KARLINER: Because he didn't belong to the Nazi Party while that little short teacher belonged to the Nazi Party. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did the teacher wear a uniform in school? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did anyone wear uniforms in school? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What year was that, approximately? 

WALTER KARLINER: Could have been 1935, '36, '37. I don't remember exactly. I would say '35-'36, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were there any other incidents of, uh, abuse in school? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, yes. There were some-- I remember and I know my brother mentioned it to me all the time, but we had a-- a fellow in-- who lived a few houses away from us. He was crippled. He was-- he had one arm short. He was-- and he was one of the most anti-Semitic young boys there was. His name was-- I'll never forget it-- his name was Mantle. I-- Mantle was his name. 

And his father was a-- a tailor. But he was very bitter because of his-- I guess his deformity. And he spit on-- on me, on my brothers and sisters, on all the Jewish boys and girls in class. And he formed a group of other boys and girls that-- not-- mostly boys that hated us. And he hit us out, but not-- you know, he tried to hit us in the streets and things like that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember any, um, effort to-- by the teachers or by the other children to distinguish you as a Jew, any way in which they called attention to your Jewishness? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, they all knew it so they didn't pay attention to it. Except school in Germany was, uh, six days a week, from Friday till Saturday. But because my parents-- my mother was quite a religious-- she did not send us to school on Saturday. We never went to school on Shabbat, Saturday-- Saturday. And any-- any Jewish holiday, we did not attend school either, me or my brothers-- my brother or sisters. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did that, uh, in any way jeopardize you at school, not going on Satuday? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, it did because they learned certain things on Saturday while Monday I did not know what it was all about. Yes, I did. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What else do you remember about those early days in Germany? 

WALTER KARLINER: It was tough. I mean, for us children to-- you know, we couldn't understand why we couldn't attend certain things, certain affairs or so on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ever have to sing German national songs or anti-Jewish songs? I have heard about having to sing the Horst-Wessel song. 

WALTER KARLINER: No. I was never forced. I never did it. As I remember, I never did it and I was never forced to sing it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did others sing it? 

WALTER KARLINER: Jewish boys or girls? 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. 

WALTER KARLINER: The other-- yes. Yes. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You remember the song? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you sing it now? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, one of them was a song when the "Wenn das Judenblut vom Messer spritzt". 

INTERVIEWER 1: Meaning? 

WALTER KARLINER: When Jewish blood comes off the knife. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They sang that song in school? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember what you felt when they sang that song? 

[SIGH] 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, I-- I-- I thought the-- I don't-- I just-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you talk to your parents about that? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes, I did. But they-- they couldn't do-- they couldn't do anything about it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you talk about it with your brother? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, no. I-- I never did discuss it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your sisters? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. In fact, my sister-- my oldest sister was sent to a school, a private girls' school in Breslau, which was a Jewish school earlier in the time. So she was out of that. She was in Breslau for quite awhile. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So you went on in school until when? 

WALTER KARLINER: Until I was about 13 years old and then they did not allow any Jews to attend school. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you were able to have a bar mitzvah. 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. But school and bar-- you see, I had-- I had Hebrew classes and I-- I attended these classes and I became-- I was bar mitzvah'd, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did they hold the bar mitzvah? 

WALTER KARLINER: In our synagogue in Peiskretscham, Silesia, Germany. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was there any reaction from your fellow students or from the town about this celebration of your bar mitzvah? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, I guess they didn't even know about it, they didn't pay attention to it. They didn't. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were your parents frightened in any way or concerned in any way about what was happening? 

WALTER KARLINER: They was afraid. But in 1936, things wasn't as bad as-- as they became later. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why? 

WALTER KARLINER: Because Hitler didn't have the power as he had in 1937 or '38. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what happened after the bar mizvah, what happened to you? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you weren't allowed to go to school, what did you do? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, I stayed home. My parents had a grocery store and we always-- my brother and my older sister, we always helped out in the store selling and things like that. But later, it became very hard for even my parents to open the store because the Nazis put-- there were some not SS, but SR. There was obviously SS, which had the black uniform and the SR had a brown uniform. The put them in front. They was all-- not always. Most of the time, there was an SR man in front of our store telling the Gentile people not to go into our store and buy stuff. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You remember that. 

WALTER KARLINER: I remember that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you think? 

WALTER KARLINER: Oh I-- I don't know what to think-- what-- what I thought of at-- at that time. But my parents-- my father mentioned about leaving Germany and we checked going to Israel, which was very hard to get into Israel. And that must have been 1937 already. And also at one time, we tried to get to Mozambique. It's a-- it was a French island somehow and some Jews was allowed to go there. But then my father said it's very hot there and he didn't want to go there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what did the family do then? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, we tried to go to Israel, we tried to go to America. We are-- we had relatives in Hartford, Connecticut and also in Baltimore. So we applied for visas to exit Germany to go to America and we was on a quota on a waiting list. When our quota came up, we would have or probably what might have gone there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Then what happened? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, then what happened? Uh, the Kristallnacht came up. That was in November 1938. Uh, my-- our stove was in front and we lived in back. And we heard some noise that night. I do remember I heard some noise. My father-- and he looked out, he couldn't see anything. But then he went in the morning-- at eight o'clock he went into the store, and when he came into the store our whole store was a mess. Everything was destroyed. 

The-- the bottles, the glass, everything was turned around. Our front plate glass window was open. They came through that plate glass window in and destroyed everything. So my father thought some burglars broke into the store and we called the police. And the police says they was going to be over, but they never came. Because we didn't know what was happening. And that night every-- every store in my town was destroyed by-- I mean, was burglarized or destroyed by the Nazis. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You mean he broke all the glass in the store and you never heard it that night? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yeah. They had-- I was-- the store was way in front and our living quarters was way in back. In between there was a hole, there was an empty spot. It was quite a big house. The front house was entirely different from the back house. In fact, I'd like to mention that front house was on Main Street while the back house was close to the Catholic church. There was a back and another street was in back. This is how long the house was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So you came-- they came during the night and they-- they-- they created that terrible destruction but you didn't know until the morning. 

WALTER KARLINER: We didn't know and we thought somebody broke in on something like that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So then what did you find out? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, my father called the police and they wouldn't-- they said they was coming over. Nobody came over. And a few-- half hour later, the SR came in and asked my father to come with him. By that time, we already heard from other Jewish families that our synagogue burned down. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where were you during these-- these few hours? 

WALTER KARLINER: In back in our bedroom. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When your fa-- when the police-- when the Sr came to the store, were you with your father or were you in back? 

WALTER KARLINER: I think I was with my-- if I remember, I was with my father. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you see, what do you remember of that moment that they came? 

WALTER KARLINER: I was frightened. I didn't know what was going on. I-- they took my father and-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the scene of them taking your father? Would you describe it as you saw it? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, they didn't shackle him up, but they took him and, uh, he just put a suit with him I think a coat because it was winter, you know November is already cold. And he left. He didn't know where he was going. And later on, we found out they took all the German men up to the age of-- no, over the age of 16. I was not 16. If I was 16, they would have taken me then, too. 

And, uh, they took him some place and from there they made a ship-- they shipped them-- also my uncle who lived about 20 miles from us-- two uncles of mine-- to Buchenwald. And my mother didn't-- she was alone, she didn't know what to do. And well anyway, uh-- about four or five hours later on the corner, there was a man that had a small grocery store. He was-- he belonged to the SR, too. He came and asked my mother to sell her-- the house and the store. 

INTERVIEWER 1: To sell him her house and her store? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yeah, our-- well, our house and the store. The whole building and everything. And she says, no. I'm not going to sell it. Why should I? So within a few days or a few weeks, she-- she was forced to sell our house and store to him for 18-- I remember, it was 18,000 marks. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who forced her? 

WALTER KARLINER: Him and the SR or the SS somehow. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your mother didn't know what happened to your father, didn't know where he was. 

WALTER KARLINER: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Didn't hear from him? 

WALTER KARLINER: We didn't hear from them until I think four or five days later that he and his brothers, two brothers, and other relatives was in Buchenwald. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know what Buchenwald was? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did you think he had gone? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, it was some-- some kind of a camp. And they said they was going to send them from there some other places. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you frightened, were you worried? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, yes. But you see, I was young. I didn't real-- I didn't realize what things were all about it as much as later on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was your mother saying, what was she doing? 

WALTER KARLINER: She was crying. She was crying. And some other relatives came to her and, uh, we didn't know what to do. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long did this go on? What happened next to you? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, my father and my uncle, who later on moved to Hartford, he was told-- my-- my mother and my-- my aunt from Breslau, from Gliwice, she was told that if they buy tickets to go to Shanghai, they would be released from Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: From Auschwitz? 

WALTER KARLINER: From Ausch-- I'm sorry. 

INTERVIEWER 1: From Buchenwald. 

WALTER KARLINER: From Buchenwald. I'm sorry. From Buchenwald. They would be released if they-- if they can prove that they have tickets to go to leave the country. So my mother and my aunt bought tickets for my father and her husband to go to Shanghai. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And for the children? 

WALTER KARLINER: No. They couldn't go. Only-- only the men. And my father stayed about two months in Buchenwald with his brother. And when he came home, he had the tickets to go to Shanghai. And, uh, when my-- when my father came home, I didn't recognize him. His head was all shaven and he was skin and bones. And he didn't want to talk of what happened in that camp because he was told not to say anything of what he saw there. 

And from that point on, he didn't want to leave us. He didn't want to leave us in Germany and go to Shanghai. He says, we have to go out together. So I think by that time already, it was fairly easy to go-- to get tickets or to buy visas to go to Cuba. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, he didn't tell you-- even you, his-- his children and his wife-- what happened to him in Buchenwald? 

WALTER KARLINER: No, he didn't. No. Later on, we found out, but he didn't tell us. We was too young to-- you know. Uh, so my father got some tickets to go-- he bought some tickets for-- I think not tickets. He bought some visas to go to, uh, Cuba for the whole family for $500. At that time was $500. And, uh, we also booked-- we tried to-- there was every month there went two small ships from Germany to Cuba. 

They were smallest freighters. And they was all booked up. There was about-- they had to rooms for about 60 passengers. And because they could not get enough people on that board, so the Haapag, the German, uh, shipping company, put a big ship to get a bigger amount of people to Cuba and that was the St. Louis that they put together. 

So my father booked ship-- booked that ship for us, for our family, to go to Cuba. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your immediate family or your uncle and his family? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, no. It was my immediate family and also my uncle, my Uncle Walter. And also I had an uncle and aunt, they was older people from Gliwice. They had a-- a bakery in Gliwice. They also booked on that ship. Their name was Handler and they had-- their son-- they had two sons that was in Baltimore already. So on-- anyway, my uncle and aunt Handler from Gliwice book that-- that boat, that St. Louis. 

My uncle Walter from Breslau, who is a dentist, and my parents, my brothers and sisters. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember going to the boat, getting on the boat, packing to leave? Do you remember? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. I remember the packing. We could not take any money out, and because we couldn't take any money out, my parents bought-- they bought four German Leica cameras because we had some money on the-- so the Leica cameras, we hid them someplace in our furniture because they was bought here in America $500 apiece at that time. And also my parents bought a refrigerator, a new refrigerator. And they bought a lot of new clothing and we took beds for six people because were six beds and furniture for six people. 

Altogether, we had 26 cases that we-- that we tried to get out from Germany to go overseas to Cuba and later on to America. I also remember the voyage. We took a train from-- from Gliwice to Berlin and we stayed in Berlin for a few days and then we went to Hamburg. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you remember about your stay in Berlin? 

WALTER KARLINER: Uh, we stayed only one day in Berlin, I think. But I remember the-- the stay in-- in Hamburg, Germany. We stayed in-- I remember it was in the Hotel Bismarck. And while we was in-- we had to stay four or five days. I don't know why the wait was in-- in Hamburg before we could board the ship. And while we was there, our uncle-- several uncles came to say goodbye to us and we took some cruises, you know some ships, small ships, cruises along the port. I remember that. In fact, I have some pictures at home. And-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you feel sad to be leaving Germany? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. I-- I-- I felt sad. But my-- my parents, especially my mother, felt much worse. 

INTERVIEWER 1: She felt? 

WALTER KARLINER: She felt much worse leaving Germany and our relatives that was behind and whatever we-- my father or grandfather ever worked for. In fact, when we-- we got on the ship, and my mother cried quite a bit on the ship, especially when we left, when the ship started to move. And the-- there was-- on the ship, there was an orchestra and they played [GERMAN] this is leaving a city, you know. This is a German song. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember it? 

WALTER KARLINER: The whole song? I don't, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the tune? 

WALTER KARLINER: "Muss ich dann, muss ich dann, von Stadt allein nach Hause" or something like that. I don't-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What does that mean? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, uh, I must leave-- I must leave my home. And the orchestra was playing that when we left. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This was a luxury ship? 

WALTER KARLINER: It was a very-- it was a very beautiful ship, by the way. It was a luxury ship, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many people were on the ship and who were they? 

WALTER KARLINER: On that ship, there was about supposedly 960 people, passengers. Out of them, there was-- some of them was mixed messages, I mean between Gentile-- marriages between Gentile and Jewish people, men or women. There was also-- I understand later, there was also about, uh, 18 or 20 Cubans that boarded that ship that was not-- not Jewish. And-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: They were going home. 

WALTER KARLINER: They was going home, the Cubans. Yeah. But the-- most of the people on the boat was Jewish, the passengers. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Cubans had been visiting in Europe and-- 

WALTER KARLINER: I guess so. I didn't know it at that time there was Cubans aboard. I did not know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were your accommodations on the ship? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, uh, my parents had a cabin and I had a cabin with my brother and my sisters had a cabin, too. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And where were you going? What was the-- what was the-- where was the ship bringing you and why? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, my mother wasn't too happy to leave Germany. She was very sad. My father said, too, but there was no hope for us to stay there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And so you thought you were going to Cuba to live or-- 

WALTER KARLINER: No. We was going to Cuba just for a while until our passports-- until our visas-- our quota comes up to come to America. Because we had quotas, numbers for entrance to come to America. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why do you-- why were you allowed to go to Cuba? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, the-- at that point, the Germans was very glad to get rid of the Jews. It-- they was glad to-- to-- for Jews to leave the country at-- at that point. And, uh, they let us go. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And the Cubans were-- were welcoming Jews? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, I-- we didn't know at that time. Uh, on the boat, it was a very happy occasion for all of us because the ship was very beautiful. Every night there was a dance on the boat. In fact, we-- we also had a masquerade party. By the way, the boat left Hamburg, Germany, the 13th of May, 1939. But it also stopped in South-- Southampton-- Southampton. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Southampton. 

WALTER KARLINER: Yeah. And picked up more refugees, I guess German refugees there. And we also stopped in Le Havre out of the port to pick up some more. And then we kept on going towards Cuba. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many days till you reached Cuba? 

WALTER KARLINER: I think six days altogether. In fact, the first-- the first day out at sea, most people-- I got very seasick and it was terrible. But, uh-- well, anyway, we had movies aboard and everybody was happy. It was a fairly happy occasion later on. We realized there was no way of return and probably we would have a better life in America, Cuba and America. 

Except I think, uh, two or three days out at sea, one of the Jewish men died. There was a man that died aboard. And during the night, they put him-- he died, uh-- they put him at sea. And when the ship stopped for that occasion, one sailor that I did not know, he was-- he was a Russian sailor, supposedly. He was a little-- he jumped overboard and the ship never-- they never found him. This was one of the sailors that was not a passenger. And then the ship kept on going towards Cuba. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was the reaction of the, uh, passengers to this Russian sailor who had jumped overboard? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, he also had a brother. There was two brothers there. Both was Russian sailors. And they said that he was not normal. He was a little, uh-- I don't know, depressed or something was wrong with him so he jumped. When the ship stopped, he jumped overboard. They never found him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So then what happened? Can you describe the rest of the voyage? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, the voyage towards Cuba was, I would say to us, a quite occasion. 

INTERVIEWER 1: There were lots of activities? 

WALTER KARLINER: There were lots of activities and things like that. Once we got into Cuba, we did not land. We-- we came into Cuba and we stayed in the middle of the port, which was very funny for us because we were supposed to land on a dock. We didn't land on a dock. But they said that our papers have to be cleared first. And I remember two or three small boats came with Cuban police aboard. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Police? 

WALTER KARLINER: Well, it was-- yes, the Cuban police at that time, you know. And they kept-- there was two exits from the boat, you know. The boat was in the middle of the harbor of Cuba. And they-- they said they have to clear our papers. And we stayed there overnight and another day or something like that. They didn't clear our papers and we start asking what happened. 

Later on, small boats came. Many of the German Jewish people that was already in Cuba came-- they had relatives aboard. They came on small boats and they-- they hollered up to us that we're going to come down tomorrow or something like that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They pulled alongside. 

WALTER KARLINER: Alongside. Not-- they couldn't get close to-- fairly close to the boat, but not on the boat, you know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: These were German people already in Cuba coming out to greet you on launches? 

WALTER KARLINER: Yes. In fact I, had an uncle who was in Germany. He was a lawyer. He was there. He was in Cuba and he came on boat. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You could see him from-- 

WALTER KARLINER: I could see him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --from the St. Louis. 

WALTER KARLINER: From the St. Louis. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You saw your uncle. 

WALTER KARLINER: I saw my uncle and I saw other relatives that are from Baltimore on that boat. In fact, I-- I had a small box camera and I went to the portholes and I took some pictures which I still have some. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hm. 

WALTER KARLINER: The others came and they-- they hollered to us, manana, manana, manana. We didn't know what it means. It means tomorrow, tomorrow you come down. And you know, people started to get a little nervous, how come we're already here a day, two days, we can't land? And then it came out that the-- there was something wrong with our passports to-- to get to Cuba. 

But the UGA, the Joint Distribution Committee, would work for us that we could land. I remember in-- in the port of Havana, Cuba it was very hot every day. And every afternoon, we got a shower. I remember that.
