MARTA: --be older when they had daughters about si-- 17 or 18. So they could be 40. My own mother was only 48. 

CREW: Number 17, cassette 17. 

INTERVIEWER 1: All right. The-- the-- and-- and then I want you to describe, if you didn't feel well-- I mean, after all, women have special, you know, women-- 

MARTA: No, you didn't. Nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I want to ask-- they're terrible questions. They're almost embarrassing to ask. 

MARTA: You can ask. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But-- women have discharges. They have-- I mean, what did they do? The-- 

MARTA: Oh-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you can stand it. 

CREW: Achshav ze oved. Should be ready. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This-- 

CREW: OK. It's rolling. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Go ahead. 

MARTA: So it was a-- a very primitive working camp. I spoke with-- with my friends after the war. They didn't have such conditions. I think it was one of the worst. We were 1,000 womans there. 1,000. And we lived in one, this round house. 

We were about 60, which was fine, because it kept us warm. We slept three on one straw mattress. And we got one-- no. Decke How do you call it? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Um, cover. 

MARTA: One blanket. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Blanket. 

MARTA: One blanket, but a thin one. So we slept always three together, and one blanket we put here on our feet, and one here, and one over your head, so you-- you-- you were completely covered, and so we could keep warm. I think that the cold was-- was worse than the hunger. 

And we got up-- they woke us at 4:00 in the morning, in winter. Then we had to stand about one and one and half hours in appel outside. And then we had-- we went to work. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What about the latrine, visiting the-- getting-- going to the latrine? 

MARTA: Nothing. You-- you-- we worked in a-- in a forest. So there you could go. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When they woke you, they-- you had no chance to relieve yourself. You just had to go-- 

MARTA: No, we had a la-- we had a latrine in the-- in the-- in the camp. But it was much nicer in the forest. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They gave you nothing to clean yourself with. 

MARTA: No. No. Nothing. You had no handkerchief. You had nothing. Nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You must have been very, very dirty. 

MARTA: And you didn't have-- have-- we-- we worked with our hands, and without gloves, of course. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What kind-- describe the work. 

MARTA: That I can't say in English. I have to say it in-- in Hebrew. We made te'alot neged tankim russim. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Anti-tank-- 

MARTA: Anti-tanks-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: --ditches. Ditches. 

MARTA: Di-- yes. Very, very deep, till we came on the water. It was supposed to hold the-- the-- the Russian front, because it was in Oberschleisen this. And it was very near to Poland, this village. So we worked from 6:00, about 6:00 in the morning we went to the-- but it was in a big forest. And we had to cut the trees. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And the ground must have been hard. 

MARTA: Oh, yes. Yes. And without-- we girls did it. Always two girls. And it w-- it were old forest, old, big trees. And we had to get out all this from the trees, how do you call it? ---wurzeln 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. The roots and everything. 

MARTA: The roots and the everything. And then we could make the-- It was the Todt Organisation, the Todt organization, that was the engineers from the Germans. And they told us where to go, you know. They put very, very nicely, it was straight, and-- and how many meters you went-- you had to go. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they give you tools, proper tools to work-- 

MARTA: Yeah. We had to carry them from-- from the camp. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were they heavy? 

MARTA: No. That were-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

MARTA: --not so heavy. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was supervising you? 

MARTA: The-- the Germans. But not the-- not the SS. They were soldiers from the Wehrmacht. The old soldiers that they didn't send to the front, they were there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You didn't-- 

MARTA: They were not bad. They didn't speak with us. But they didn't do anything. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know any of their names? 

MARTA: But we had the-- no. No. Never. They never-- didn't spoke to us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you know any-- 

MARTA: But we have a few woman SS there, and one Oberscharfuhrer. He was the machaneleite. He was a very, very low man. Not educated, nothing. 

And he drank. And when he drank so he was drunk, so he-- so he always had the speech to us. When we came back in the evening, frozen, we had to stand out and he had-- he wanted to speak, sometimes about an hour. 

I had a friend, she was-- she-- she was later in Czechoslovakian newspaper. I was with her in Theresienstadt. And we were always standing five in the appel, you know? Five and five. And she always told me, Marta, if I could have a little piece of paper and something to write, if-- if I could only write what he is speaking. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why did she want to write what he was speaking? 

MARTA: Because-- because he was so stupid. He-- and she-- she said, I will never remember all-- all these things what he said, which he spoke to us, about Fatherland and about Germany, and-- and-- and-- 

We had to carry-- we-- we got food in the forest. We had no kitchen in our-- that came from somewhere else. So we had to carry a-- it was a-- how to tell you? It was a kaze ke'ara gdola. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Ah, a dish-- 

MARTA: A-- a big-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Cauldron. 

MARTA: Yeah. A big dish, but it was from some ceramic or something. And you could broke it. So we had to have our tools. And we have to had this-- this dish. 

Sometimes we were so frozen, sometimes it fell, and you broke it. So then he was very furious. And he said we are sabotaging Germany because he has to buy another one for us if we broke it. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What about the SS women? 

MARTA: SS women came with us to the work. But they never stayed. They only went with us. Because it was too cold. They were very mean. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How? 

MARTA: Very mean. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Can you tell us about it? 

MARTA: Look, there were only two or three. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they have guns? 

MARTA: Yes, of course. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How were-- 

MARTA: They weren't like the-- they wear-- they wear clothes like the SS, with the-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Boots. And, and this. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How were they mean? In what way? 

MARTA: [LAUGHS] They didn't help. You could tell them something 'cause, or you need something, or someone is not feeling well, they didn't-- they said we have a hard time, too. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What-- what was the relationship between them? Did you notice anything, the way they talked to each other? 

MARTA: No. We didn't. They lived in a-- they lived in the village. In the evening, they were not in there. Only the Germans or Wehrmacht was outside. They had a pre-fabricated house outside the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: I meant-- 

MARTA: I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --did they compete with each other for-- in any way? 

MARTA: I don't think so. One was after that in-- in Bergen-Belsen. One of them we met after this in Bergen-Belsen. 

And he told-- she told us she didn't want to be SS, only she was-- she was af-- afraid because her-- her boyfriend went to the front, went to Russian or something, and deserted. And then she had to do it because they would close her up and something like this. Because she knew already this-- it will end. So she wanted us to-- to-- I think, interfere-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know her name? 

MARTA: --with the English or with someone. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know her name? 

MARTA: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm. When you got your food, you were carrying this dish. And what-- 

MARTA: No. We-- we put it down in-- in the forest. And then came the food, about midday, I think. And then we had to stand and there were soldiers that came with it and gave us this food. 

It was a-- a soup. Rice, all things in this. And that was it. And we got bread each day. In the evening, when we came back, we-- we got a little bread and sometimes a little margarine or-- or something. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you eat it all at once? Did you save it? 

MARTA: There were girls that did-- did eat, that ate it in the evening and that was it. I didn't. Many of us didn't. We-- we ate a half in the evening and a half in the morning in work. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they supervise you when you were eating? 

MARTA: No, no, no. No. No, they-- they-- in the evenings, they closed us in and they went. They were sleeping outside. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What happened when people were sick? 

MARTA: There was a-- one-- one house for sick people. And there was, with us, a-- a girl, I think she was studying to be doctor. She was not ready. But she-- she did the work there. 

But you-- you know, it was so cold, and it was-- we had nothing. And almost all of us were healthy with the war. I don't know how it is. Maybe the air was-- was so good there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened-- 

MARTA: Very few were-- were sick. Most of them, I think, from the chill-- chill burns, from the frost. Not so-- and then about end of January, the-- the Russian front was very near. So they evacuated us. And we went in the Germany. You know? Near-- to-- to the west. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did you go there? 

MARTA: More to the west. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did you go? 

MARTA: I don't know. We-- we walked, about, I think it was one week or more, we walked. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You walked-- 

MARTA: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: --the whole way? 

MARTA: Yeah, all the way. 

INTERVIEWER 2: It was a forced march? 

MARTA: Yes. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How was that? 

MARTA: The Germans came with us. All of them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You ma-- 

MARTA: The soldiers and the-- and the gesta-- and the-- we went from morning till evening. And when we came in the evening to some village, they-- they put us in some barn and closed us. And in the morning, then-- we were without food. 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you didn't-- 

MARTA: If-- if someone didn't-- didn't-- couldn't go, so they shot him. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Shot him right then? 

MARTA: Yes. Left him there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you didn't-- 

MARTA: Someone-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: --feel well in the middle of the night, could-- 

MARTA: You couldn't go out. Nobody was there. We are always closed. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what happened? What-- what-- what happened? 

MARTA: I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were never sick. 

MARTA: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You never felt like-- 

MARTA: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any-- 

MARTA: No. You-- we didn't have food. So you-- you were not sick. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No one had dysentery. 

MARTA: No, not yet. Later. [LAUGHS] In Bergen-Belsen. But not there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Then what happened? 

MARTA: Then we came till a concentration camp that we are belonging to them, that this-- this working camp was belonging to Gross-Rosen. It was a-- a men concentration camp. But we came there. And we waited till they had trains. We were there about, I don't know. The time I can't tell you anymore. 

And then we went with a train from there till Bergen-Belsen. It was maybe five, or four or five days. Days and nights. In open trains. This was for coal. In open trains. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This was in the winter. 

MARTA: The whole-- yeah. The whole Germany. Because we went-- on the way, we get-- we got, once, food. It was near some concentration camp-- I think Buchenwald. Till we came to-- to Bergen-Belsen. It's in the north of Germany, you know, after Hanover Zähle. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You don't know how many days you were on this train. 

MARTA: I don't know. I re-- I don't remember anymore. I think four or five days it was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No place to relieve yourself, no place to be ill. 

MARTA: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you ever get off the train? 

MARTA: No. We had one-- one soldier-- one Hungarian soldier was sitting in-- in the train with us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did anybody die? 

MARTA: No. But we-- we stayed one day or half a day in a station that was bombarded in a air attack. And-- and we didn't know it. But because the train was very, very long-- I think I was in the end-- and can be that-- the-- the first wagons got some something. Because the-- the-- train-- the railway station was-- had a-- no. 

Kibel... was hit. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was hit directly? 

MARTA: Was hit. Yes. Because when we came to-- to Bergen-Belsen and we went to the camp, we walked to the camp, we had to go out. So we-- we saw many dead girls on-- on the outside. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Prisoners? 

MARTA: Yes. And they were-- they were hid in this station. But they had to-- to-- they left them in the wagons till Bergen-Belsen. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was this the worst time, or was something worse? 

MARTA: No, Bergen-Belsen. Was-- was worse. Worse than Auschwitz, I think. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why? 

MARTA: I think Auschwitz is-- was an organized hell. But Bergen-Belsen was an unorganized hell. Because-- maybe because it was already the end, you could hear already the-- the-- the cannons on something. We had no water, no drinking water. And we had no facilities. There were no latrines and there was nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What did you do? 

MARTA: And-- and-- you-- you went outside. And that's where the-- it was a-- there was a big typhus epidem-- typhoid epidemic. Not only typhus. 

INTERVIEWER 1: There was what? Typhus? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Typhoid. 

MARTA: Typhus, yeah. Typhoid. Ble-- "flecktyphus," they called it, you know? 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was the worst moment in Bergen-Belsen? 

MARTA: The whole time, I think. The whole time in Bergen-Belsen. I was there-- it was from February and the English came, I think, in March. No. No. In April. Before the war-- maybe one month before end of the war. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What made it worse? 

MARTA: I don't-- because we didn't work. And we were ill. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What did you do all day? 

MARTA: You lied there on the-- on the floor. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And what did you think? 

MARTA: We didn't think anymore. It's like yesterday I heard the-- about [INAUDIBLE]. It was the same. When the English came, it was nothing for us anymore. Because each day on my side here and on my side there, someone died in the night. 

Sometimes in the room there were 10 or 15 girls that I-- I didn't know them well. But I-- I knew them. We worked together. And they were dead in the morning. So you-- you-- you couldn't react to anything anymore. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you think that you were gonna die? 

MARTA: I don't know if I think-- I don't know what I thought. I-- I know we had no-- no drinking water. And few of my friends were-- were ill with typhus. 

And we had one place where there was drinking water. So I-- I went, so at about 4:00 in the morning, it was still dark, because I had no strength to go, and later there were so many people there that I couldn't fight them. Because they were fighting about a little drinking water. 

So we had some-- we bought for-- for-- for bread or something from the kitchen, we had some tins. And I-- I put the tins on my hand. And I went to bring water for them. 

But I-- I couldn't walk anymore. I went and fall. Because we-- we had to sleep there in such a cramped position that my knees couldn't straighten out anymore. So I went each day, that was my whole work. I went each day and brought how much water I could back. And that was our drinking water. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you think when you were liberated? What happened? 

MARTA: When we were liberated? In the-- in the first time, didn't happen anything. You know, they-- they-- it was the first camp they came to, the-- the English and the-- and they didn't know what to do. So nothing happened. 

We neither had a doctor. We didn't have anything. We didn't had food. 

Only much later, and then the food was not good for us. Because they gave us tins with-- with-- with bacon and-- and things like that, from the soldiers. And girls that ate it died from it. Many, many died after the-- after the liberation. Many. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They weren't accustomed to eating? Is that what-- 

MARTA: They couldn't eat such-- such fat things after not eating for-- for a half a year, only a little bread. I didn't eat it. There were always some biscuits there, you know? Some-- I-- I already ate this and I-- I bought for the other things they can get us, Ukraine girls from the kitchen. And they bought the things. And they brought me a little bread. 

So I had for my-- for my friends with the typhus and for myself a little. That was after the liberation. Till they took us in the hospital. That's it-- it-- they-- I think it was only June when I came to the hospital. I couldn't walk anymore, and nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your-- 

MARTA: I had to wait till they come. Because these girls that still could wait went outside and they took them with the cars to the hospital. But this one came latest-- last-- that couldn't walk and was still lying there on the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You stayed there in Bergen-Belsen until June. 

MARTA: Yes. In this camp. They were already burning the whole camp. They burned the whole camp because it was so contaminated. The-- the English. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And so you stayed there-- 

MARTA: Then-- then they took, uh-- took me to a hospital. It was a recreation center for the SS in the village. Was a nice hospital. And there I was maybe two weeks or three weeks. And then I came to Sweden. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you know how much you weighed when you got in there? 

MARTA: In Sweden when they could weighed me, I think I was 28 kilo, or-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: 28? 

MARTA: --27 Kilo. Something like this, yes. I couldn't stand a long time after that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: 27 kilo. 

MARTA: About, yeah. I am now 42, so you can imagine. [LAUGHS] 

INTERVIEWER 1: When did you get to Israel? 

MARTA: I-- I w-- I was one year in Sweden and I came back to-- to Czechoslovakia. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And what did you find? 

MARTA: Nothing. I didn't find nobody and nothing. And I worked for two years in-- in the Jewish orphanage in-- in Prague. And then when the children went here or somewhere else, I came here. In '49. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No one left in Czechoslovakia that you knew. 

MARTA: From my family? No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many people in your family? 

MARTA: My mother was from six children. So-- and we were 11--
