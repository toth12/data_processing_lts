SUBJECT: Wir sind darunter galaufen und sehr viele sind schon drin geblieben, die Kinder und Frauen weil sie waren schon Tot. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now I don't understand. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They-- they left as quickly as they could. But many were left behind because they were already dead-- women and children. 

SUBJECT: Und die SS Manner haben angefangen zu schreien "rechts und links, rechts und links." 

INTERVIEWER 2: The SS people started telling them right and left [INAUDIBLE]. 

SUBJECT: Die junge Frauen in einer Seite und die Frauen, junge bei Kindern in einer andere Seite. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Young women on one side and women with children on the other. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You know, we heard-- did you know that if you went to one side, it meant extermination and if you went to another side, it meant something else? Did people know.

INTERVIEWER 2: Say it again.

INTERVIEWER 2: She said what I felt. 

SUBJECT: Ich habe gefuhlt das ist nicht der selbe Planet, das ist nicht die selbe Welt.

SUBJECT: Und das schlimmste war... 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did-- did-- did women try to save their children? 

SUBJECT: Yes. One moment-- I explain you. Sie haben gesagt dass die Frauen mit Kindern sollen in ein Auto, den Roten Kreuz, steigen... 

INTERVIEWER 2: They told the women with children to go into a-- a-- 

SUBJECT: Red Cross. 

INTERVIEWER 2: A bus or something marked with a Red Cross. 

SUBJECT: Red Cross. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They deceived them? 

SUBJECT: Die Frauen... 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sie haben sie gelogen? 

SUBJECT: Selbstverstandlich. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Of course. 

SUBJECT: Wenn der Motor angefangen ist, angefangen zu reisen, ist Gas ausgekommen und sie waren alle vergast im Auto von dem Roten Kreuz, internationale... 

INTERVIEWER 1: In-- in the truck? 

INTERVIEWER 2: When they started the engine in the truck, the gas was pumped in and they all died. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The truck was the gas chamber? 

SUBJECT: Yes. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But were some people separated from their-- some women separated from their children? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. They always took mothers with the children? 

SUBJECT: With children, with children. Und sie haben gedacht weil die SS haben gesagt das zu Auschwitz ist sehr weit zu gehen und das ist vielleicht in ein Autobus zu fahren, da haben sie geglaubt. 

INTERVIEWER 2: The SS people told them that it is too far to walk to Auschwitz. And it will be much easier to take a ride in a bus. And that's why they believed them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did-- did the other people standing there-- you were standing there-- did you see what was happening? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You couldn't see what was happening? 

SUBJECT: No. No. Das haben wir spater erfahrt. 

INTERVIEWER 2: This they found out about later. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So when they first started the bus, it just was a bus? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, bus with gas. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And then they moved it away? Then they pumped the gas into the bus? I-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Als die ertmitteln Bus abgefahren ist, haben Sie gedacht das ist ein einfacher Bus? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Yeah. Ja wir haben geglaubt das ist wahr. Wir wussten noch nicht wie die SS konnen lugen. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They didn't know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: [INAUDIBLE]. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They didn't know how the SS could lie. And so they were deceived. They did believe that this was regular bus. 

SUBJECT: Und dann als sie angefangen war... 

INTERVIEWER 1: How do you know that that's what they thought? 

SUBJECT: Later in Auschwitz... 

INTERVIEWER 1: But how did you know? None of these people stayed alive to tell you. So how did you know what they thought that it was-- 

SUBJECT: The people never come to Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 2: No, but what she's asking-- 

SUBJECT: [INAUDIBLE] 

INTERVIEWER 2: --is how did you know-- how did you know-- 

SUBJECT: Nein, sagen Sie in Deutsch. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Wie haben Sie spater erfahren? 

SUBJECT: Erfahren. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Wie wussten Sie das stimmt? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Weil nie sind die Frauen mit den kindern herein gekommen im Lager. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Because they never saw the women and the children arrive at the camp. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I understand. But how did she know that the women and the children that got into that bus did not think or know-- did not believe that they would be murdered? How would she know what they thought? 

INTERVIEWER 2: You understand? 

SUBJECT: Das war nicht der erste Fahrt. Immer wenn die Frauen mit Kindern wurden nach Auschwitiz deportiert sie sind nie im Lager angekommen und die Kommaraden die war da schon, bevor uns, sie haben uns erzahlt. 

INTERVIEWER 2: People who were there before told them. And this was always the case, that these women and children have arrived in-- at the camp. Aber wie haben die Frauen und die Kinder... 

SUBJECT: Man wusste alles. 

INTERVIEWER 2: She says everything was known. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Zum Beispiel ich war nicht im Gaskammer, nicht, sonst ich nicht hier gewesen, aber wir wussten genau was Gaskammer ist, was Krematorium ist 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do understand that? 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They-- they knew, even though, of course, she says the fact that she is here means that she didn't go to the gas chamber. But they knew where it was and what it was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Many people say that these people that were gassed didn't resist, didn't care, went willingly. And I want to understand how you knew that they got into that bus without knowing that they were going to be killed. And if they-- and if they thought something, or why couldn't someone tell them, they're going to kill you? 

SUBJECT: Ich werde erzahlen was mir personlich ist passiert. 

INTERVIEWER 2: She wants to tell you what happened to her personally. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes. 

SUBJECT: Zwei Jahre habe ich gearbeitet als Dolmetscher in der Politsche Abteilung von Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 2: She worked for two years as a translator in the political department in Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT: Und jeden Tag mussten man zweitausen Frauen vergasen. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And every day, they had 2,000 women gassed. 

SUBJECT: Every day. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How-- how did you see-- did you see them gassed? 

SUBJECT: Yes, one moment. Ein tag hat sie...das war ein schwarzer Autobus ist stehen geblieben neben unser Buro und ein SS ist herein gekommen und hat genommen eine Kameradin der Department von links, und hat sie genommen in der Autobus nach Gaskammer. 

INTERVIEWER 2: One day, a black bus stopped by the place of her work and picked up a woman worked on her left. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Could you say the same thing in English? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Try it-- about the black bus. 

SUBJECT: Now, when I worked in Politisch Abteilung, in office, one bus come to a door from office. 

INTERVIEWER 2: A black bus. 

SUBJECT: Black-- and this SS come and take my friend. She was my side. And she was put in auto. And SS, Nazi, he per-- give permission. This is was two minutes. You understand? 

INTERVIEWER 1: No, I-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: It took two minutes to take her away, I mean. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And nobody said anything. 

SUBJECT: Nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 2: He just came in and told her to go. 

SUBJECT: Told-- yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did she know? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: She didn't know. 

SUBJECT: Sure. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you know later that this bus took her to the gas chamber? Did you know when she left? 

SUBJECT: Look, I tell you, I-- I works in office, Politisch Abteilung. I have lists. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You had lists of people that were going to be killed? 

SUBJECT: Sure. Sure. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why didn't you stop them from taking her? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Warum haben sie das nicht vermeiden? 

SUBJECT: This was impossible. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But did you know then that they were going to take her? 

SUBJECT: Sure. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You knew and she didn't know? 

SUBJECT: She-- Ist immer eine Hoffnung da, man glaubt immer man wird das uberleben. Viellecht wird sie weglaufen von diesem Autobus. 

INTERVIEWER 2: There was always some hope. She thought she could always-- 

SUBJECT: No, [INAUDIBLE] 

INTERVIEWER 2: --maybe she could run away or maybe something will happen. 

SUBJECT: Sie hat gar nicht Zeit zu sprechen. Aber was ich haette gedacht... 

INTERVIEWER 2: She had no time to speak. But this is what she thought, that she-- what she would have thought in her place. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What would have-- what would have happened to you if you had tried to keep them from taking her? 

SUBJECT: What? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was Tat ihm passieren wenn Sie versucht... 

SUBJECT: Weg zu laufen? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Nein, nicht weg zu laufen, dass Sie vermeiden das sie ihm nimmt? 

SUBJECT: Gaskammer. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They-- they will take you to the gas chamber then, too? 

SUBJECT: No, no. Wenn ich... 

INTERVIEWER 2: If you try to stop them. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Aber es war Momente in Auschwitz ich wollte gehen Freiwillige im Gaskammer. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yes. 

SUBJECT: Ja weil man konnte davon nicht mehr sehen. 

INTERVIEWER 2: She says that there were moments when she wanted to go to the gas chamber out of her own free will. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And what stopped you? What stopped you from just going? 

SUBJECT: Um. Ich habe Hoffnung gehabt dass mein Mann lebt und meine Familie. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You were married? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How-- how long had you been married before they took you? 

SUBJECT: One year. 

INTERVIEWER 2: One year? You got married when you were 19 years old. 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And you hoped that your husband was still alive? 

SUBJECT: [INAUDIBLE], yes. But no. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And he wasn't. But you were hoping all the time that maybe-- 

SUBJECT: Yes, and my family. 

INTERVIEWER 2: --maybe he was alive. Maybe you'll see him again. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And that stopped you? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Wa-- had he been-- was he in a concentration camp? Did you know where he was? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You knew where he was? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where was he? 

SUBJECT: In Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You knew he was there? 

SUBJECT: Ich werde ihn erzhalen wie ich wusste. Ich konnte in die Karte sehen, I habe erlaubnis gehabt, ja, und eines Tages kommt ein SS und sagt mir "Ihr sollte suchen auch die Karte, der Name fangt an mit O" und ich habe gesucht... 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did the SS in the office where you worked-- what did they-- how did they treat you? 

SUBJECT: Yes. I want him to... 

INTERVIEWER 2: You wanted me to translate that? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: She had permission-- she had access to the-- to the cards of people. And one day, an SS person came in and told her to look up somebody starting with an O. And so she had access to go in. Apparently, this is how she found out that her husband was at Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT: A moment. 

INTERVIEWER 2: There were records. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. A moment, it's very interesting. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And she [INAUDIBLE] the records. 

SUBJECT: Wir haben zwei Kartotheken gehabt wie die grosste Amerikanische Firma. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Can you try to say that in English? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So I can follow you. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So she can understand? Try. I'll help you. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Just try. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I'll help you with it. 

SUBJECT: Wie sagt man Kartothek? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Um, cards.

SUBJECT: --if he live. 

INTERVIEWER 2: If he's alive. 

SUBJECT: --is alive, if he sick, if he was in gas chamber. And the card what I take was my husband, Gaskammer. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So you saw the record? 

SUBJECT: And I-- and I see so. And SS told me, quickly, quickly. Schnell, schnell. And I asked them "Ihr habet mein Mann vergast? 

INTERVIEWER 2: And she said to them, you gassed my husband. 

SUBJECT: And he tell me, it's OK. "Du wirst auch vergast." 

INTERVIEWER 2: And he said to her, it's all right. They're going to gas you, too. We're going to gas you, too. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What-- what was-- what did he look like when he said this to you? How did he act when he said this to you, that your husband had been gassed and now you would be gassed?
