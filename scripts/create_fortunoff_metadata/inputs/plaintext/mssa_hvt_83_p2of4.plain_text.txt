And mother could take a certain amount each month. Not much, but because my brother and my husband were working, so it was-- what we could buy for that, what we could buy, it was enough. 

And then, my father was very much loved in our town. And we got-- I don't know till today from whom, someone from a village sent us each week a package with food till we went away. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You don't know now? 

SUBJECT: I don't know. No. It was never with a name. Maybe he was afraid or something, but it came with the post. And we got always the same things.

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you do? 

SUBJECT: I worked in a laundry. But in a big, big one. That was washing for the whole ghetto. It was outside of the ghetto. Not in the ghetto. We walked. We walked there about one hour. One hour and one hour back. Not alone, of course. With Czech gendarmes

And from there, they had to load it on trucks. And from the trucks, it came to the ghetto. And there, they had to unload it. So some worked outside and some worked inside. Potatoes and mostly. For the kitchens. Because we didn't-- 

It was not like in Polish ghettos. Theresienstadt was organized other-- we didn't cook for ourselves. We didn't got food. We got cooked food in the big kitchens.

But we couldn't-- we could see each other in the day. During the day. But 8 o'clock, you had to be in your place. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was there any possibility for intimacy between husband and wife?

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you know where? 

SUBJECT: No. We knew only it goes to the east. But where, we didn't know. We didn't get anything in from there. We got sometimes-- there were Czech gendarmes. Those people that were working outside of the ghetto. And they were-- with them, sometimes they brought a newspaper or something to read. So we had some information from outside, but not from the transport where they are going. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you-- 

SUBJECT: But always-- but we were not so afraid because my work and my husband's work was very useful for the ghetto. So we-- we were-- we, we didn't come to the transports. For the two years, we never came from that because we worked in these sections. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you angry to be incarcerated like that? Kept in a place? 

SUBJECT: Look. You didn't have time and you were hungry. And you worked very hard. It was physical arbeit, I work. My husband worked was very hard physical. We washed-- we had a washing machine there that washed in one time 160 kilo. And you had to put it in. And you had to take it out. And then, there was a centrifuge for the same amount. It was very hard work. 

There-- we worked about 120 women there. The most of them were older women. Only we-- we were six young, young girls that were on the machines for the ironing and things like that, that worked. They were-- the older women worked there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you get enough to eat? No? 

SUBJECT: No. No, of course not. So we worked-- we never had a day off. We worked from, uh, 6:00 in the morning to 12:00 one week. No, two days. And then, from 12:00 to 8:00 in the evening. And then, from 8:00 in the evening till 6:00 in the morning. 

And one hour you had to go there. So we had to be on this place from where we went out of the ghetto. We had to be there one hour earlier because we had to give them our-- we had such passports and that we had to give them. 

And then when we came back, we had to wait till they gave us to us back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What if you didn't feel well, if you were sick? 

SUBJECT: So you could go to a doctor if you-- if you get from the doctor, you could be off. 

INTERVIEWER 2: In the ghetto? 

SUBJECT: Yes. There were hospitals, too. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were there children there?

INTERVIEWER 1: Was there any education? Was there any-- 

SUBJECT: Yes, there was. It was not allowed, but there was. There were two houses, Jugend houses, from young-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Youth houses? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. There were children from 12 till 16 or 15. They were living together. One house were boys. And one house-- and the teachers, the Jewish teachers that were there, were living with them. It was like-- like they were only working with them, but they-- they had regular school. And we had theater. And we had opera. And we had-- we had a philharmonic orchestra there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said it wasn't allowed, but they must have seen this?

INTERVIEWER 1: They were supposed to be playing? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. They worked a little for the Germans. There was a-- a garden there. Vegetable garden. And the young people worked there. It was for the Germans, not for us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened after that, after the two years? 

SUBJECT: After the two years, it was already autumn of '44. So many transports were going out from the ghetto. Only young people. Later, I heard they were afraid maybe there would be some because there was the Warsaw Uprising. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uprising. 

SUBJECT: Uprising, yes. So they were afraid it would happen in Theresienstadt because-- so they sent the young people out. 

So first went to transport only men without women. My husband was in the third one. And they were already-- before the transport, they were always concentrated in one place. You couldn't go in and you couldn't go out. 

And, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What kind of place? 

SUBJECT: The whole Theresienstadt that was a military town from the Czech army. So they were-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Barracks.

INTERVIEWER 2: Barracks. 

SUBJECT: Not barracks. Houses, but with big, big rooms for 300 people. With big kitchens and so. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Armories. 

SUBJECT: There were houses, private houses, too. We lived in private houses. But most of them. And it was like this, you know? Around the town was a wall. And after the-- from-- in the walls were big doors. You could go out only to these doors. It were, I think, five. So it was very easy to be in, to be closed in. They didn't have to-- they didn't have much people to-- there are not many gestapo people. They had one house in the middle of the town. And that was it, I think. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And how many people were in the town? 

SUBJECT: Oh. There were times where sixty hundred people. It was a little town. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So your husband-- 

SUBJECT: 60. 40. 40,000 people. Usually. If it was too full, they sent more transport to the east. To the concentration camps. 

INTERVIEWER 1: People kept coming in to Theresienstadt? 

SUBJECT: Yes. From-- not only from Czechoslovakia. There were German Jews, Holland Jews. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what happened when your husband was-- 

SUBJECT: My husband was in transport, but women were not allowed at that time. But they had no trains, I think. And they had to wait one week. So they gave them allowed They could go out for a few hours. 

And then, they said some women can go. They said, I think 50 or something, when-- when they want to go. So I heard it, so I went immediately. And they took me. They told me I can go. 

So I went with my husband. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where? 

SUBJECT: To Auschwitz. We didn't know, of course. I was with him only in the train, of course. And then when we came to Auschwitz, women went alone and men went alone.
