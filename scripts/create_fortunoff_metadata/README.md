# Fortunoff Metadata Transformation

> A script to extract information from data provided by Fortunoff Archive Yale University. It is a Marc XML file (archived as fortunoff.marcxml, and copied to /data/inputs/fortunoff/metadata/) transformed into a python dictionary, and then to app conformant mongo collection (output_fortunoff_metadata), which is finally copied into the testimonies collection, the final output of all transformations.
