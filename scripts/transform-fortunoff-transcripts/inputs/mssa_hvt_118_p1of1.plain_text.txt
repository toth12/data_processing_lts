They were voting for the lowest people to make this ever think to live. 

And later they came in and went around our committee, committee. They were but 13 people. And the 13 people was among them, the most prominent people from the city. Among them was the commissar for the police. When they came in, a lot of them and this kind of people were my new customers. They couldn't look me in the face. 

And the commissar start to say, Mr. Rayfberger, I hear you are very good tailor. Only this is so dirty for you, it is impossible to go to you for a suit. I told him, please, show me where there dirt is. There were pieces from this from cutting the goods. 

I said, I was already in different countries. I never saw that the-- the difference made to work, that after cutting to put this in the pocket, only to throw on the floor. Well, Mr. Rayfberger, you pay 15 zlotys. If you don't pay now the pay, is tomorrow 30, 30 zlotys. I paid rather than wait. And this went down not only by me, only to a lot of Jewish stores.

And this told him, Mr. Mendel-- like I don't know exactly now the name. Uh-- if you have such a sentiment for Jew, you go to order three suits in one time. This time when we don't want to-- we trying to-- not to-- uh-- not to-- to help the Jew. We-- we tell you-- this has another word that I cannot now say.
