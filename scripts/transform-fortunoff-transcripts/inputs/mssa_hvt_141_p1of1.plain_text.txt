INTERVIEWER: How did you happen to change your name? 

MAURICE POST: Well, I have four children, and when they went to school, to pronounce Poznanski was too hard, and the kids were making fun of them. So we decided to change the name, to shorten it, and to change it to Post.

INTERVIEWER: Four boys and two-- can you describe your home in Lodz for me a little bit? 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. It was a regular home. It was a two-- three-room apartment, and they were tailors. Until 1939, when the Germans invaded Poland. Then they-- in May 5, 1940, they-- they send us to ghetto. 

INTERVIEWER: All right. Let's-- let's let's back up a little bit to your-- to your being a tailor. Were you both tailors? Did you learn from your father? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yes. 

MAURICE POST: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: What language did you speak at home? 

MAURICE POST: Yiddish. 

INTERVIEWER: Yiddish. When did you speak Polish? 

MAURICE POST: Just in school. 

INTERVIEWER: What about-- 

MAURICE POST: And in the government. When we came to the government. 

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh. What about you? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Governmental institutions. 

INTERVIEWER: In mental institutions? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: The governmental. 

INTERVIEWER: Governmental institutions. I see. What type of religious training did you receive? 

MAURICE POST: Just the Jewish, and we had to talk Polish when we had-- when we came to places where they couldn't understand Yiddish. 

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh. Was that the same with you? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yes. That's correct. 

INTERVIEWER: At what age did you start to work? 

MAURICE POST: I was nine years old, I start working. 

INTERVIEWER: Tell me a little bit about that. 

MAURICE POST: My father died when I was eight years old, and my mother was left with six children. My older brother was 12 years old, my sister 11, my brother Abe was 10, and I was eight and 1/2. And then I have a brother five years. And my sister, the youngest, she was born 11 weeks after my father's death. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. How many hours a day did you work? 

MAURICE POST: 16 hours a day. 

INTERVIEWER: What about you, Mr. Poznanski? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Well, first of all, when my father passed away, we had to go to school and work half day. When we came home from school, we had to work to support the family. We were the only ones, and my brother and him and the other brother. We had to do some work, and otherwise, we wouldn't-- couldn't make it. 

INTERVIEWER: Until how late at night would you work? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Went till late. 11, 12 o'clock. 

INTERVIEWER: Then you'd get up, and you'd go to school? 

MAURICE POST: Yes. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yes, in the morning. We'd have to go to school. 

INTERVIEWER: Were you comfortable as a Polish citizen in the 1930s? 

MAURICE POST: Never. Not in the '30s, not in the '40s, never. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you want to explain that a little bit? How did you feel? 

MAURICE POST: We were semi-prosecuted. Semi. Not officially. But wherever it was something, even when it was a Polish holiday, they always jumped on the Jews. They always said, Jews, why don't you go to Israel, to Palestine. At that time, it was Palestine, not Israel. We were never welcome. And a Jew couldn't hold high official office in Poland. 

INTERVIEWER: What about you? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: I'm the same way. We both went through the same experience. 

INTERVIEWER: When-- when did you feel it getting a little worse, the anti-Semitism? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: When Hitler came to power. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. And what happened then? 

MAURICE POST: And then they always spend-- they wanted to tease us. In the way it was teasing, and in the way it was true. They said, let's only wait until Hitler comes to Poland, then he will show the Jews what they can do. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. Did you have any personal experiences of anti-Semitism? 

MAURICE POST: Oh yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Would you tell us? 

MAURICE POST: From the Poles, or from the Germans? 

INTERVIEWER: Either way. 

MAURICE POST: Either way. From the Poles, we had-- in Poland, in Lodz, where we were born, it was not a ghetto, but mostly the Jews live in-- in one place. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Concentrated in one place. 

MAURICE POST: Concentrated in one place. And when we got out of that place, they came a little bit farther out in the city, where the Gentiles lived. They always-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Chased us. 

MAURICE POST: Chased us and beat us up and said, Jew, Jew, Jew. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They would throw stones. 

MAURICE POST: [INAUDIBLE] Jew. 

INTERVIEWER: Would you fight back? 

MAURICE POST: How could we fight back? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: We didn't have a chance. 

MAURICE POST: We haven't got a chance. If it was-- if it was the-- even the government was against the Jews. 

INTERVIEWER: OK. When did you-- when were you aware that there might be a war in Poland? When did you first hear about Hitler? 

MAURICE POST: In 1938. We-- they start talking about the war. When Hitler set to Poland, it was about Czechoslovakia. And they said to Hitler, you take a-- a Czechoslovakia, and-- and we will give you Gdansk 

And since I-- Gdansk was a state from Germans and Poles. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Between. 

MAURICE POST: Between. So they said, if you let us take Czechoslovakia, we'll give you Gdansk 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. 

MAURICE POST: So that time, they thought they will get-- both of them will get rid of the Jews. But it didn't come out that way. Hitler invaded. In 1939, he invaded Poland. 

INTERVIEWER: What happened when Hitler invaded Poland? 

MAURICE POST: Right away, he confiscated all the Jewish properties. And the Jewish-- and they put all the Jews in the ghetto. Took him from-- they came in in September, 5th of September, and took him till May 1, 1940 to make the Lodz ghetto. 

And then the trouble started. We couldn't get out. We couldn't get in. We didn't get enough food to eat. And in the thousands, in the thousands die a day of hunger. 

INTERVIEWER: How old were you then? 

MAURICE POST: I was then 23 years old. 

INTERVIEWER: How old were you? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: 24. 

INTERVIEWER: You were 24 years old. What happened with the-- how did you survive in the ghetto? 

MAURICE POST: We were young, and we worked for the Germans. And as long as we work for the Germans, they gave us enough food to keep us alive. But we were always hungry. We were always hungry, naked, and barefooted. 

INTERVIEWER: Was all your family together with you? 

MAURICE POST: All the family was together. We lived in one-room apartment. And not enough in the winter, heat, and not enough food, and we had to work. 

INTERVIEWER: What kind of work did you do? 

MAURICE POST: Tailors. 

INTERVIEWER: You still did tailoring. 

MAURICE POST: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: When-- what happened to you after you left the ghetto? 

MAURICE POST: We-- they took us to Auschwitz. From Auschwitz, they took us to Dachau. Dachau-- not officially in Dachau, because Dachau was overfull. So they built 11 concentration camps around Dachau. They send us to those camps. 

INTERVIEWER: How long were you at Auschwitz? 

MAURICE POST: In Auschwitz, I was 10 days. 

INTERVIEWER: Were you both together? 

MAURICE POST: We were both together then. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: We were sent out together. 

INTERVIEWER: And what happened-- what happened to the rest of your family? 

MAURICE POST: They went to Auschwitz. And my sister had two children, and women with children they put to the-- to the gas chamber right away. And all-- my mother, too. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Older people and sick people and women with children had to go to be burned in the-- in the gas chambers. 

INTERVIEWER: Had you heard anything about Auschwitz before? 

MAURICE POST: We didn't have nothing because we didn't even know what's going on. It was so tight that we didn't even know what's going on. 

INTERVIEWER: What happened when you first got to Auschwitz? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: When they-- when they were about to evacuate us out of Lodz, they said we're going to go to a place where we are going to live together with all our families. But that wasn't the case. The case was that we were separated. 

MAURICE POST: They cheated us. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They send each one in a different place, so we'll never be together. And mostly didn't make it together. 

MAURICE POST: They told us a lie. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Of course they did. 

INTERVIEWER: Did they know that you were related? 

MAURICE POST: No. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: No, I don't think so. 

MAURICE POST: They didn't-- they didn't talk about it. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They never-- 

MAURICE POST: A Jew was a Jew was a Jew. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: And they didn't care who was related or who isn't. They just took all in a whole bunch. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you work in Auschwitz at all? 

MAURICE POST: In Auschwitz, no. They haven't got time to give up to put us to work because too many people came in one time. They liquidated the Lodz ghetto and the larger ghettos around Lodz. And so many people came to Auschwitz that they didn't even have time-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: To put us to work. 

MAURICE POST: --to put us to work and put numbers on us. Now, a few days later, in a few days, most, they did. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: In fact, I didn't get the number. Some did. The ones that were there the longest. 

MAURICE POST: They just [INAUDIBLE] the number. We lost the name. We only wore our number. 

INTERVIEWER: You only wore a number. 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: That's all. 

INTERVIEWER: And what happened when you got to Dachau? 

MAURICE POST: To Dachau, they put us in-- in-- in barracks, and then the sick people were staying in the barracks, and the little bit more healthy people went to work. I went to work. I carried dead people on a little buggy, 10 and 12 at a time. 

I-- I chopped wood. I went to the Krupp a German big comp-- big, big company for the government. And they build uh-- a [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] this means a factory-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Under-- under the ground. 

MAURICE POST: On six floors under the ground and six floors above. In one instance, we were standing by the-- by the toll. We-- we carried 50 pound cement on our backs. I was weighing 66 pounds, and I carried 50 pounds of cement. 

And just for fun, they pushed in a few people to that grave. Alive. And when we went home from work, it was cold, in the wintertime. I took a paper sack and put a hole over my head and pulled two arms through the-- through the-- paper sack. It was filled with cement. It was raining. When I got into the barracks, I watched a piece of cement. 

INTERVIEWER: When you got into where? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: The barracks. 

MAURICE POST: To the barracks. 

INTERVIEWER: Into the barracks. 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. I was a piece of cement. 

INTERVIEWER: This was the way you [INAUDIBLE]. 

MAURICE POST: The rain-- yeah, the rain and the cement-- 

CREW: Hardened. 

INTERVIEWER: How did you get-- how did you get out of it? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: [INAUDIBLE]. 

MAURICE POST: It was not-- it was-- it was not that hard. But it was beginning to harden. So when I came to the barrack, I tore off the paper sack. And-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Unless it fell off. 

MAURICE POST: --and we had so many lies, if I would have dollars, I would be a millionaire. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. What type of work did you do in the camp? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: We both did the same work. We worked toge-- went together in the same type of work. Carrying cement, carrying iron, doing it for the building of that factory, in the ground-- under the ground factory. So whatever he worked, I worked the same thing. 

INTERVIEWER: What type of food were you given? 

MAURICE POST: A little bit dirt and warm water. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Watery soup. 

MAURICE POST: With-- with sand. They didn't even bother to wash-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Wash the-- 

MAURICE POST: The-- the-- the grass. We were eating grass. On the barracks, the barracks was on the ground, and they were like-- like that, pointed, and on the top was growing grass. We tore out the grass, and we ate it. 

INTERVIEWER: You tore out the grass of the ground? 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. Until we were swollen. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: What he means, the barracks were in the ground. Just the roof was above the ground. 

INTERVIEWER: Oh, I see. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: And it was all grown grass over it. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. Was there any way to manage to get extra food? 

MAURICE POST: No. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: I tried once. I went to the kitchen to-- to steal a potato. I was beaten up. I was getting 50 on my-- 

MAURICE POST: Lashes. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Lashes. And I-- I couldn't feel mine for-- for months. 

MAURICE POST: I-- I saw one guy stole a head of cabbage, and the log elders, they shot him on the-- on the spot. They caught him. They shot him on the spot. 

INTERVIEWER: Did people help each other in the camp? 

MAURICE POST: They haven't had with what To help 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They didn't have anything to help each other. And everybody was on his own. 

MAURICE POST: One was-- was expected to earn it. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you mean everybody was on his own? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: When-- when somebody couldn't get something to eat, he wouldn't share with anybody else. 

MAURICE POST: Because he was not enough for himself. I remember, when I came home from work, and I was standing in the line for the soup. Call it a soup, but warm water with sand. With grass. And was alarm. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: An alarm. 

MAURICE POST: Alarm from the American flyers. They came over. And somebody kicked me in the back and said, your friends are here. It was my fault that the Americans came to-- to the bomb the-- the-- the-- the Germans. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. 

MAURICE POST: It was my fault. 

INTERVIEWER: How were you-- how were you treated in the camp? Were you constantly disciplined? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Roughly. Very roughly. 

INTERVIEWER: Can you tell me about some? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: I-- I was beaten with a-- with a rubber hose. See this ear? This ear was all swollen like this. And they never treated it, so it's-- it's-- it's not a whole-- just like a hardened. 

INTERVIEWER: And why-- 

MAURICE POST: [INAUDIBLE]. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Just-- just because I was-- I wasn't doing something right. I didn't walk right or something. They didn't tell you why. 

MAURICE POST: Because I-- I-- I was looking up of at the American planes, and somebody with a board hit me in the back. I thought he cut me in half. Right in the kidneys. 

INTERVIEWER: Right in the kidneys. Was there any type of medical-- 

MAURICE POST: Not at all. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: No, you just could get a little aspirin or something. There was no medical. When somebody got sick, that was it. They had to die. When somebody got sick, they made selections. 

MAURICE POST: Selections [INAUDIBLE]. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They didn't even wait till they died. They-- they got rid of him before he was gone. 

INTERVIEWER: Were there any times when you hid from the guards or any incidents of-- 

MAURICE POST: Oh yeah. That-- when they came in to the barrack, and we didn't go out, we could barely move. And we didn't get out so fast as they wanted us to, hop, hop, hop! They started chasing the cars and kicking and then beating. And we went out 4 o'clock in the morning on the snow. Barefoot at [INAUDIBLE]. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: [INAUDIBLE] just a little shirt on. 

MAURICE POST: I mean barefoot on the snow. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Shaking. We would stand for hours. 

MAURICE POST: We were standing from 4:00 till 7:00. And they-- they count us 10 times, until they send us to work. And to go to work, we-- we must march. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: March. Not-- not-- not-- driving. 

MAURICE POST: Not dri-- not driving. We march seven miles to work and seven miles back. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you have-- 

MAURICE POST: Rain and snow. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you have shoes? 

MAURICE POST: No. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Shoes. We had-- we had rags on our feet. 

MAURICE POST: When they gave us the shirt in Auschwitz-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: That was it. 

MAURICE POST: For nine months, I was wearing the same shirt. 

INTERVIEWER: Without-- 

MAURICE POST: And-- and I-- I thought to myself, if I-- if the hunger wouldn't kill me, the lice is going to kill me. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: We had typhus. Both of us. We had typhus. 

MAURICE POST: Typhus. 

INTERVIEWER: In Dachau? 

MAURICE POST: In-- in-- Kaufering. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Kaufering. 

MAURICE POST: They were a part of Dachau. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: From Dachau, they sent us to Kaufering. There were 11-- 11 camps. We were camp four. 

MAURICE POST: Dachau was overfull. Too full. So they send us around Dachau. They build the-- the camps. 

INTERVIEWER: Was that a work camp? 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. All of them were. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: All of them. They were just for work. 

MAURICE POST: But the people couldn't work. In our-- in hour camp, in our camp, in camp four, there was only two blocks for working people, Block 53 and Block 54. And now, me and my brother, we were lucky. We were in those two blocks. We were able to work. And that's why-- maybe that's why we got out alive. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. 

MAURICE POST: Because we still could work. 

INTERVIEWER: Was that the important thing in the camp? 

MAURICE POST: That was important. If you-- if you didn't work, they came selection, and they took out all the people. Not from those two blocks. Those two blacks they left alone. 

The people who could work. But the rest of the blocks, they took-- of the barracks, they took out the people. They made the selection. They-- so if somebody couldn't walk, he already goes to crematorium. 

INTERVIEWER: Were you both in the same barracks? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yes. 

MAURICE POST: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: What about communication? Were you able to talk on the job or communicate? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: No. He was taken to a different-- 

MAURICE POST: A different part, and he was taken-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: When we got there, the people who were in charge, the Germans, well, I need 20 people. I need 13. I need 20. I need 15. So we couldn't say I want to be with my brother. 

MAURICE POST: I-- we had another brother, my oldest brother. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yeah. 

MAURICE POST: And-- and in the day, in this boy's-- in February 26, when they took us out from-- from camp to go to Tyrol to the last solution, they wanted-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Eliminate us. 

MAURICE POST: He wasn't able to walk. So when we were all standing out already from the camp, we saw that they put the camp to fire. And who couldn't walk out of the camp-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Everybody in there got-- 

MAURICE POST: Got-- got-- burned. They burned the car-- the-- the camp, because they didn't want when the-- the American army will come in-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: To find anybody alive. 

MAURICE POST: To see what's going on. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you have any doubt that you would survive? 

MAURICE POST: No. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: No. Never mind. 

MAURICE POST: We lived from day to day. 

INTERVIEWER: What about other people in the camp? 

MAURICE POST: Just the same as-- as we. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Whoever survived, survived. And when the Americans came in, they took us to the hospital. And some people died even after that. 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. Because they couldn't stand after that, and they got food, and their stomach was-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Wasn't used for-- 

MAURICE POST: Used for food. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They died. 

MAURICE POST: So they-- they died after that. 

INTERVIEWER: What was your feeling when you saw the Americans? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Oh. 

MAURICE POST: We didn't-- when we-- the-- we-- when they took us to Tyrol they took us on-- on-- on two trains. On one train was the German soldiers, and on one train was the-- the-- the people from concentration camp. 

They figured if they will go on those two trains, that the Americans won't bomb the-- the trains. But they did. So we got out. By that time, 130 people of us died in the train. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: [INAUDIBLE]. 

MAURICE POST: And we got out from the train, and we went into the forest. And we stayed two nights and two days. It was raining. And-- and the Germans, when they run away from the train, we got into their train-- train, and we were helped. Clothes and blankets and food. 

We were staying in the forest for two days and two nights. It was raining. Me and my brother and two more people. But those two died after they-- liberation. They couldn't make it. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: The first time, when the-- when the Americans shot over the train, of course, we all ran into the forest. But when it was over, the Germans tried to get us back together. 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. They called us out. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They were looking in the forest and finding-- if they can find some runaways. Some couldn't make it. They just stayed in place, and they would have to go back on the train. 

And then for a second time, the Americans tried to shoot over-- over the train. This happened, what? Two or three times. 

MAURICE POST: Yeah. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: But the third time, the Germans were afraid to bring us back together because they said the Americans eventually will take over, and they want to make friends with us so we'll say-- say good words for them after the Americans come in. They were-- that's why they didn't try to round us up anymore. 

INTERVIEWER: Why not? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They tried to make friends with us. 

INTERVIEWER: What happened then? 

MAURICE POST: Then, well, came the liberation. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: They threw off the-- their uniforms. And they became civilians. 

MAURICE POST: In Ap-- in April 28th-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: But some-- some of them made it OK, but some of them, we had to point out who they were. 

MAURICE POST: On April the 28th, we were liberated in Schwabhausen And from Schwabhausen they took us then to a sanitorium, St Otilien 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: St Otilien 

MAURICE POST: In St Otilien I stayed three months. And then they send us to Feldafing, near Munich. And then after that, after the liberation, we found out that we have our sister, that she is still alive. But she is now in Israel. So we went to look for-- for our sister. We found her. 

INTERVIEWER: How much did you weigh when you were liberated? 

MAURICE POST: 66 pounds. 

INTERVIEWER: How much did you-- 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Something like that. 

INTERVIEWER: Something like that? I don't understand. How did you get from the forest to the camp? What happened? 

MAURICE POST: The American soldiers came in, and they called out that we have to come out not to be afraid. We are Americans. 

INTERVIEWER: I see. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: The Americans landed. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. How long were you in a DP camp? 

MAURICE POST: Eight or nine months. 

INTERVIEWER: Nine months. And what happened there? 

MAURICE POST: This was the-- this was the DP camp.

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yes. 

MAURICE POST: No. He was married. He found his wife. I wasn't married. 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Yeah. We were separated when we went to Auschwitz. And after the war, we looked in different papers, and there are announcements where people are. And I find her name. And I went there. She was in English zone. And we found each other. 

INTERVIEWER: And then where did you go? Did she come to you, or did you go to her? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: No, I came to her. Then we-- then we both went to-- to live in the United States. 

INTERVIEWER: Why did you decide to come to the United States? 

ABRAHAM POZNANSKI: Well, it was an opportunity that we could go wherever we want to. 

MAURICE POST: No, by that time, Israel was a young country. And-- and we are, as tailors, we figured that in Israel, we might not make a living. So we said, we figured we'd-- to come to the United States and to make a-- a living. And-- and if we would like, we'll go to Israel. And my sister, she went to Israel. 

INTERVIEWER: When did you come to the United States?
