INTERVIEWER 1: --sensitivities occur a lot. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: All right. 

CREW: OK. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK? We're rolling? 

CREW: Go ahead. 

INTERVIEWER 1: All right, Mr. Baum, would you start by giving us your full name and where you were born? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: All right. My-- my name is Abraham Baum. I was born in Poland in 11/24, 1924. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And, uh, where in Poland? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Lived in Krakow-- I was born in Krakow. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. Can you tell us about your family and how many children, what you did, what your parents did? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: There were seven children in my family and I was the oldest. We were being raised by a very Orthodox father and my mother also came from a very Orthodox Jewish family. We had a kosher home and my father had big plans for me, of course. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were those plans? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: He was hoping one day I will be, maybe, a rabbi, or anything educated-- person in Jewish religion. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did your father do for a living? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We had a small farm and we also had a little grocery store to supplement our living. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm, and your brothers and sisters? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: My brothers and sisters were-- I had-- we were four sisters and three brothers. I mean-- I mean, there were four sisters and three brothers. And they were going to school, of course, just like me. And we lived in-- on this little farm and it wasn't easy by any means. Poland was not a big country. But we were seemed to be happy and carry on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you notice that made you realize that things were changing, that-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, even before the war broke out, there were a lot of unrest in Poland, as far as the Jews were concerned, especially the Hasidic Jew, Orthodox Jews. They were being harassed on trains and in the city. They were being pulled by their hair and kicked around. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you see any of this? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I, myself, was a victim of it. As I was attending school, my father wanted me to wear a ki-- a yarmulke in school. But the kids kept pulling it off and tearing it and tore it down between themselves playing with themselves. After I came home and told my father about it, he took me out of public school. Although there was a lot of complaints about it from the authorities, I was sent away to a small city nearby to attend Jewish school. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was year was this, sir? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: And that was in 1935. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So as early as 1935-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: '35. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --you were experiencing discrimination. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you see any other incidents of, uh, unrest? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, I have see-- I did see other incidents. With my father, we get up in the morning can we find writing, obscene writing on the wall, on the doors of our little store and home. They will write down not to buy from a Jew, and not to play with us, and things like this. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you discuss this in your family? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, we discussed it quite a bit. My father also planned, or had some hopes of emigrating to the United States in those years. Then he-- but being very Orthodox, he didn't do anything without consulting with a Rabbi of some sort. And he told him that-- he didn't advise him to do this because it would uproot the whole family, and he could not continue his Hasidic and Jewish ways in life. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So the rabbi advised your father-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Not to-- not to emigrate, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. What other-- what other things did you see or hear that made you feel times were difficult? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, I, uh-- when I did come home-- I came home on weekends-- I would see the neighbors ignoring us in different ways. And of course, they did not come to the store unless it was absolutely necessary for them. And then we found windows knocked down sometimes. Our-- our land and our crop was at times damaged by Poles. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why did you think this was happening? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I had-- I had no idea. I was too young to comprehend it while it was happening. But it definitely hurt me very much. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But it was different before 1935. You didn't have these things happening before 1935? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, they seemed to just-- overnight, seemed to come from all directions. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So then what happened? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Then, of course, the war broke out in 1939. My father volunteered to fight for the country, being he was a soldier from before. And being the oldest, of course, he told me all the details, and told me that he should not return, I should look out for my brothers and sisters, and then carry on, help my-- help my mother, take care of her. And that more-- upset me so much more by being charged with such big responsibility, and the fact that being discriminated by a country, and then my daddy volunteering to go fight for it, that also did not fare well in my mind. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were about 15 at this time? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: 15. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what happened? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: So the war, of course, was over in no time, didn't last no time. My father was captured by the Russian in-- in-- in-- Lodz, a city in Poland. He was kept for two weeks and then turned loose. And as he was coming home, he counted the synagogues being burned up, countless different cities. They were burned and he was told that they were burnt with the all people alive while they were attending new years and Yom Kippur services. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was burning them? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: The Germans, as they were occupying city by city. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you see any of this? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, I did not see this. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you see? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I see when my daddy came home he was a very disturbed person. He was-- he always wore a beard. And once, he decid-- his neighbor advised him to cut his beard off so that he wouldn't be so obvious as to look Jewish, so he could still carry on a daily task without being constantly observed and everything else in whatever he did and where they went. 

So he agreed to this. He shaved his beard off. That also left me with such a broken heart to see. I always looked up to my daddy, but then all at once, he was giving in. And there just was nothing to encourage me anymore. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And your mother? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: My mother was a very hard-working person. And I could see her crying behind-- in corners and places when she concealed herself, but that's all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you could talk about this with your brothers and sisters? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, I talked about it. They also came home with different stories of telling-- telling me that they were beaten up by Polish children. They were told they didn't want to play with Jewish children, and so on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So after your father came home and cut his beard, then what happened to the family? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Then-- then-- then came a directive from-- from the Gestapo that all Jews had to give up their land and farms. And they gave us several days to vacate the place. They told us to take just the necessary things and move into one neighborhood, a little city neighborhood, [? [POLISH] ?] was the name. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember packing? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I do. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you tell us about that time? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: It was very depressing because we didn't know where we were going. We didn't know how much space we had. So we-- we got-- we did get one horse with-- we had two horses, so we took one. And put the belongings, what we thought we were allowed to take, and put them on the wagon, put our children on it, and we all rolled into this little neighborhood, suddenly left everything behind. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ever consider-- did the family ever consider not leaving, not going? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, we were-- we were saturated with fear from the Germans. And every time we seen a German, we thought he was 10 feet tall. And we-- and we were never violent people, Jewish people, just in-- we were never taught to be violent and-- and-- disobey things from the authorities. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember what you took with you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We took clothes, of course. We took a little bit of food we could on this wagon. And we took this horse and one cow. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you moved into the city? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: To the city, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you live in the city? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Very cramped, it was-- it was hardly enough space to even sleep. I was sleeping in the attic and with-- and the smaller children slept on the floor. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you living in this place? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We lived there about three months until we suddenly, one night, we were-- we were-- awakened by-- by-- pounding on the doors by Germans. And they kept howling, "Aufmachen aufmachen." 

Before my mother managed to get to the door, the door was broken. I was awakened, of course. I came down and I was the first one to face them. And they asked me how old I was. I told them I was only 12. They say, that is all right, you can work. And they motioned me to go into the front door. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why did you tell them you were 12? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I was-- I was-- we heard from other places that they were rounding up people for different camps to work in. So since-- I thought, I'll tell him 12. I thought maybe he wouldn't think I was old enough that he didn't-- could use me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You thought he'd let you stay with your family. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what happened? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: So as they were searching the house, they moved out of my sight. Instead going to the front door, I went to the back door and escaped temporarily. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did you go? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: In mein shorts, I went through a back yard. I crossed a little river. And when I came on the other side, there was a policeman. And he motioned me to go back-- Polish policeman. 

So I went back and hid myself in that yard. I went quite a ways and I hid myself in this yard. And there was a lot of poison ivy in this backyard, but I was laying in it for several hours. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What time of year was this? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: That was in June. 

INTERVIEWER 1: June-- June 1940? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: 1940. Until finally, daylight came and I seen a boy with a cow grazing there nearby. So I raised my head and things quieted down. I couldn't hear this noise from people screaming and hollering, like-- everything seemed to quiet down, so I raised my head, and I asked this boy, is everything all right? He said, yeah, everything was all right. 

So as I got up a little higher, I noticed I was laying right near a police station. And this policeman noticed me. So I noticed him, too, that he could see me, so I ran into his barn that was nearby, a cow barn. 

But he followed me up there, grabbed me by the neck. And I pleaded with him to let me go. I told him, I'm as Polish as you are. But he said, no, you've got to pay-- you guys, you're a parasite. 

INTERVIEWER 1: He said you were a parasite? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: He said that we lived in the Polish world long enough. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Explain this. Why did he say that to you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, I-- the best I can understand, Jewish people in Poland did not-- did not work in places like firemen, policemen. They were mostly forced to do some business of some sorts, either selling shoes, or clothes, or be a tailor, or some sort like this. And that Polish people always looked at the businessmen like a man who was constantly cheating, and-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Jewish people were not permitted to be policemen or fire-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: In Pol-- mostly, at least, they were not, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was that a rule from way back, or was it a recent rule? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, I don't know exactly what the government rule was, but you-- have-- you never found a Jewish policeman or Jewish fireman or-- in any city, jobs like that, or a bus driver, for that matter. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what happened after he grabbed you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: He grabbed me, carried me to this marketplace where they were getting all the others they already had and loaded up on trucks. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were not dressed? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, I was still in my shorts. But as I was pushed in the stall and beaten a few times with a rifle butt by the Germans, then came my little-- and my little brother. He had-- he had his shoes in his hands and some clothes for me to wear. 

And they all hollered at me. They wouldn't let him go to me, but they hollered at me through the distance. They told me that they were looking for me all night long. They didn't know where I was. They-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was looking for you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: My family. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And then what happened, you were on the truck? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, they beat us and crammed us as tight as they could and carried us away. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you get the shoes and the clothes? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, they did let me have the shoes and the clothes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So where did the truck take you and what happened? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: They took-- took me to a place named Mielec which was a plane factory. They were building small fighter planes, the Germans have. I assumed it was also a Polish factory at the time. And they took us to this camp near-- there was a camp near this plane factory, and put us all in there. And there was already a wire fence surrounding with guard towers and everything prepared for the keepers of the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ask anyone why you were there, or why they took you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Oh, they told us we were going to work. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. Do you remember the name of the place? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Mielec was the name. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Camp Mielec 

INTERVIEWER 1: And what did you do? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, after we settled down the next day, they lined us all up and gave us-- we had to give up all this-- this private clothes we had. And they dressed us up in this camp uniform, these striped uniforms with numbers on them. And they told us that we were responsible one for all and all for one. If one escaped, his neighbor, the guy who was with him, will have to pay with his life for it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You have some numbers on your arm. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you get that there? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, they numbered us with "KL," which means "konzentration lager" in German. And since we were forced to work with civilian population-- so that civilian population, as they were leaving the gates, they had to raise their right hand like this to show that they did not have any markings on tit. That was the purpose of that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did it hurt when they put that marking? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, it swelled up a lot, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. How long were you there and what did you do? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I-- I was there for three years. I was forced to work 10 and 12 hours a day in this plane factory. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you correspond with your family? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I, uh-- at the beginning, I was very uncooperative. And I kept crying and fighting this fate that finally over-- came over me. I just could not understand how the other night I was subject to such terrible treatment. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What kind of terrible treatment? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, I was-- that-- I was-- they would wake up in the middle of the night and just drag us out. Just when we got ready to sleep, they would drag us out and count us for no reason. The food was terrible. There was cabbage in it with-- with caterpillars just floating around in the soup. And of course, we all got sick, I'm-- I included. And every morning, around 10 o'clock, the Gestapo would come over to take old and sick people, throw them on a wagon with their high fever, and just carry them away behind the camp and shoot them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you see that? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I see them being carried away and they were never to be seen again. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know they were being shot? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, because the people who dig the graves did come back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did the guards treat you and who were the guards? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: The inside administration was mostly done by prison inmates themselves, people that came from my own city. They would serve the food and line you up for work. But as you left the gate, you were taken over by Germans. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were the-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: And marched on the thing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were the people in the camp kind to you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Because they couldn't be. The surroundings were too-- too bad for people to be kind to each other. It was a case of survival. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But they were you, they were part of your own people? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: That didn't seem to care-- mean anything. They just completely forgot it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They were afraid? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Absolutely, they are afraid of their own selves. Hunger and fear was your constant companion. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you have friends in that camp? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, I had even two cousins in it. And they kept telling me, you have to wake up and face reality, otherwise, you will never have a chance to survive. And I kept trying to tell them that I just couldn't care less, until this day that I received this letter from my father and the rest of my family. Part of them signed the letter, some didn't, so I have reason to suspect they might not been alive already. 

And he told me that he wish he could trade places with me. As strict as he was all those years, he says, he loved me very much. And he says the war will not last that long. I should make every effort to carry on and do the best so we can see each other someday. And now I think this letter did have an impact on me. I did kind of straighten myself up. I started eating the food, in spite of it was so bad, and tried to make it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In what way were you sick? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Oh, and then finally, when I came down with this fever and with this typhus fever and diarrhea, I couldn't make it to work no more, so I stayed-- decided I'm going to stay home, regardless. So when this morning, when I was up there, the Gestapo came. And as they usually did, they started hollering, rounding up all the people that were-- stayed away from work. But I must have had enough fear, I guess, to hold me to it, and I hid myself under some boards and stuff that they had over there. And this guy that came from my city, the kapo, knew me, he looked under those boards, he'd seen me. And he just left me over there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: He didn't give you away? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: He did not give me away, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That was a kindness. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Very much-- I-- I met him after the war and I think I did something for him to repay him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Tell me about the work that you did? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, I worked mostly body work. What I-- they give me a gun, an air gun with rivets and we were riveting together vague wings for the airplanes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Drill holes, put a rivet in it. And one person has to hold up a piece of metal behind it and the other one drives this air gun until the rivet spreads and holds. It's called riveting. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many hours a day did you work? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: 12 hours a day. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You walked to work? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, we walked to work. It wasn't that far, maybe a couple of miles. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they feed you while you were at work? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, the food was very scarce and very bad. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you talked to your friends about what was happening, did you have hope? What did you talk about? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, they would at times, would-- someone would smuggle a paper in the camp, and they would try to read it and explain it. And then we would all hope that the war would come to a quick end. But at the same time, we were told that there was no hope for us because before they-- the war would come to an end, regardless who wins, we all would be destroyed, they said. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the names of any of the Gestapo or the guards? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, I do not. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened to you after the three years-- three years, like that? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I was very weak, of course. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This is when you got sick. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And what happened? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: And, uh, I was still carrying on because I was afraid to be-- I also had trouble with drainage in my ear. And there was a little place there, in the barracks where you could get some medication. But you had to give your name every time you went there, so the guy in there told me not to come here too often, he said, because if I have my name there, the next time they-- the Gestapo wanted people to be shot, I'd be the first one. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: So of course, I was afraid to go in there, too. At night, the-- in the summertime, the roaches would eat us up. And we couldn't sleep. They just seemed like even the roaches turned against us in this circumstances. The place was just crawling with them. And when you went outside to get some air, the guard from the tower would shoot down. He was thinking you might want to escape or something. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was there a latrine nearby? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, but you could not go out at night. 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you were sick during the night, what did you do? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: You did-- you were just laying there in your own filth. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you have any change of clothing? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: There-- yes, there were some changes of clothing that they'd give us. But it-- it-- we was all saturated with lice and stuff that it just didn't make much difference. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you keep clean, at all? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I didn't. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were hiding under the board and they didn't find you. What happened to you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Oh, I finally came out when the Gestapo left. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you stayed in the camp? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, stayed there the rest of the day, but the next day, I-- of course, I knew better. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You knew better? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, I went to work with the fever and everything. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you got well? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Eventually, yes, I did get well, well enough to carry on, anyhow. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ever try to escape? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Never, it never crossed my mind. There was a case there where three men escaped. And they must have not caught them because the next morning, the Gestapo came. 

They lined us all up and they took every 10th man, pulled them out of the line, and they shot 300 people then. And they told us that was the reason for it. We have to pay for their escape. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Are there any other incidents like that that you remember? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I was also in another camp in Leitmeritz where three Polish people escaped in Czechoslovakia. They bought-- they did capture those. And they lined us all up and they hung them and they told us to make sure to watch them, how it's done. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were there in this camp for working in the factory for three years. And then what happened to you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Then as the Russians made advances in Poland, they took us out of this camp, put us in cattle car trains, and carried us to Germany, supposedly. But we stayed in Auschwitz for two days on the train. We were sitting there on this side-- side rail same way. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You remember that? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, we could see-- smell and we could see the smoke coming out of the chimneys. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know what it was? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Did I knew what it was? Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Because I heard so much about Auschwitz. It was a very famous name. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you tell us about the ride in that cattle car? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: This ride was terrible. It was in the middle of the summer, it was end of July there. They-- in this case, they gave us plenty bread, but no water. They packed 90 people in the cattle car. There was only standing room. If you would sit down or duck down, you were mashing up or-- or you're scraping another person. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you manage for that period? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Uh, when they opened those cars, they were-- half of them were black in there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Black? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you mean, black? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: From dirt and sweat, I assume. They will unrecognizable. But what I noticed when they opened those cattle cars, they had machine guns set up in front of every cattle car, of every car. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you think about when you were in that cattle car? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I was-- there wasn't-- I never thought I'd survive, that's for sure. And I also encountered another thing from Polish people-- we were-- just before we left Poland, we were standing on this rail and there were Polish people. Whoever could get to this little window in our cattle car, they were telling them to-- asking them to bring him some water. They also had some jewelry and money. And they gave it to him. But there was never any water brought to this thing. They took it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They took the jewelry and the-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: They took the jewelry, the money, but they never brought us any water. They just laughed at us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you on the train? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We were on the train for 12 days. 

INTERVIEWER 1: With no water? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No water. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did people, uh-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Urinate? Everything went just like-- like cattle, I guess, or like pigs. There was no way to-- to do anything. 

INTERVIEWER 1: [SIGHS] 

What happened when you got there? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: When they opened the-- the trains, 'cause half of them were dead, or maybe more. And we marched out of there the best we could. And they carried us to a name, to a place named Flossenburg in Germany. 

And when we finally got there, most of them could hardly walk up there. They did give us a bath. They sprayed our privates and stuff with this powerful stuff, but I forgot what it's called. 

Anyhow, and they-- they let us-- they gave us barracks, places to stretch out. And we stayed up there for two weeks. And that-- from there, they-- they shipped us in different places in Germany. I went to Augsburg. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What is Augsburg? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Augsburg was another camp over there. And we were over there. We worked in a place , some woods like, we were cutting down trees to clear some kind of land. 

And what they sprayed me around my privates with this powerful stuff, I-- irritated completely all around there. And we, over here, would have to walk at least eight miles every day. And I was hurting so bad. It was just-- the wound was wide open, where my legs were just rubbing it back and forth. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were bleeding? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Bleeding, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was there anyone to help you, any medicine? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Well, I was afraid, always was afraid to report anything because as soon as you were considered of some-- a casualty of some sort, you were, of course, the first one to go to the crematorium. So I suffered as long as I could, until I-- finally, I couldn't walk. And I went in this little place where there was supposed to have been medicine, I showed it to him. And he let me stay away from work. He applied some kind of medicine on it, Vaseline. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was he? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: He was also an inmate. He was German, as I assume. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A doctor? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah-- he wasn't no-- there was no doctors. He was just a guy that was in charge of it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were-- how were you able to do the work when you were feeling so ill? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I still could not explain this. I guess fear drove me, kept you going. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you there? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We were in Augsburg-- we were only a very short time. We were about eight months. And I kept hoping that the thing could come. I always hoped that-- we'd move away from here hoping that the next place would be better, but this was never the case. The next place was always worse. 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you were an Augsburg eight months, you must have been there through the winter. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was the-- what were the conditions? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: It was very cold over there. There was snowing there. And we had shoes that completely deteriorated. The snow would go in in the front of the shoe and it would go on out in water-- water, so. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you get sick? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I-- I got sick. I felt like my toes and my feet were getting frost-bitten and everything else. But I kept going. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened after Augsburg? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: After Augsburg, they took us to a place named, uh, Leitmer-- uh, Leitmeritz, yeah. Leitmeritz-- there was-- again, we were considered airplane craftsman of sorts. And there was another airplane factory over there. And this plane factory was built under a tunnel in order to escape the bombings from the allies. 

And right there, near this plane factory, of course, they built the barracks to hope that the Americans, by seeing the prisoners, would stop from bombing this place so they could keep building them. That was the reason behind it. The place looked like it was built overnight. It had no water, no running water, nothing. There was a little pipe with water dripping from it and that was the only water available. You had to stay in line to get enough water to drink or wash your face. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many people were in this place? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: They were 300 people in this camp, all kinds of nationalities. For the first time, I was exposed to all sorts of nationalities-- Algerians, Italians, and different people. All I could hear is just a mumbo-jumbo. I could not communicate with them. If I didn't watch myself, they hit me in the head cause I was small size and I was always afraid and I would look like I was-- was a victim to someone. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Had you heard from your family? Did you know what happened? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, I-- I-- after this letter that I received in Mierletz, Poland, I never heard from my family again. I had reasons to suspect that they were carried away. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your cousins? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, all-- the cousins, we were separated in Germany, when we arrived in-- in Flossenburg. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In this camp, were-- where they were hiding you, were the conditions better? It was-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Compared to the others, yes, it was still better. At least there were more facilities there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were inside? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you there? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We stayed there, practically, until-- until we stopped working and the-- because the allies finally did hit this-- this-- this plane factory. They-- I guess they took the risk and they hit it anyhow. And when they start hitting this factory and destroyed it, there was no need for us to be there, so they carried us away. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: They-- just walking, there was no other transportation at the time. Just walk in the daytime. Maybe sleep a few-- lay a few hours on the grass and well on the streets. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was the-- what was the time of year? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: That was also winter time. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were sleeping outside? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Asleep in the outside, laying down outside. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you have to protect you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Nothing, a bunch of straw, uniform, torn clothes. We, uh, at one camp, they even gave us paper uniforms made out of paper. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When it rained? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: When it rained, they disintegrated. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you walking? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: We were walking like this for-- I'd say, for about a week. It looked to me like it was aimlessly just walking because we wasn't-- had nowhere to-- the guards told us the war was coming to an end and that we should try to hold on to everything we can, to our lives, and keep going. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who were the guards? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: The guards-- at this time, there wasn't Gestapo. They were just regular German soldiers, Wehrmacht. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Uh-huh. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: They were mostly older ones. I assume they were either wounded or not able to carry on in the front, as they put them in charge of us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They tried to encourage you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, they did. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. Did you ever hear their names? Did you ever speak to them? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I spoke to them, but I am very weak, don't remember names. And I really don't remember their names. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember what you were thinking about at that time? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: What I was thinking about it? I guess I could see and smell that the end was near, but there also was my life. I just felt like from day to day, I was growing weaker and I just couldn't even carry on, even this not working deal, just wandering around like I was, was also getting to be harder and harder. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was liberation like for you? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I do not remember now. It can come to me like-- sort of like a dream. I remember the Americans going through the gates with a tank of some sorts, or a military vehicle of some sorts. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were back in a camp? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I was. And finally, when we-- from all of this traveling we were doing, we finally came to Dachau. And that's when-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you in Dachau? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I wasn't there but several days. And then I was liberated. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe Dachau? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Dachau was a very big camp, of course. Bodies were laying, piled up like-- like wood all over the place. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you walked into the camp, you saw bodies? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yes, I saw them laying by the-- by the hundreds. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you think? What did you say? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: It, of course, scared me, but after all them years and as weak I was, I guess I was not even concerned with it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you have a place to sleep, a place to get protected? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No, we-- we-- we did-- they brought so many of them, seems like at the time. And they were taking as many as they could and machine gun them down because they knew the end was coming near. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you keep from getting killed? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, well, they-- they told-- there was cases where they told us to stand up while they lined up the machine guns. Some people-- I just laid down. I was-- fell down and I didn't manage to stand up. I couldn't stand up. So when the Americans came through, of course, they dug through all the bodies, and whoever was still alive, they cared and they made a hospital out of a movie house near Dachau and carried them over there. I spent six months in there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you think of going to Palestine? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Uh, no, I felt like I lost all my family. And war made me sick, even the sound of it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you go back to look for your family? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You never saw Poland again? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Never saw Poland again. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How to-- how were you able to leave Europe? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Oh, I was given an opportunity to emigrate to the United States, of course. I had other choices, but I choose the United States. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many people in your family did you lose, do you think? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Everyone. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Everyone? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Everyone. I came all along. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You have never been reunited with anyone in your family? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you think now? Do you believe in God? You were a religious person. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Uh, no, not-- to be honest about it. I am Jewish, of course. I was born Jewish and I will die Jewish. But that was part of the reason that I did not follow through with my religious studies after the war. I was practically destroyed by this experience. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you trust people? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: No more than I have to. I am suspicious of everything. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you tell your children? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: I love them and I tell them that-- I tell them the story of what I've been through and they can make their own decisions. But-- but I think I might have told them at times not to trust anyone no more than they have to. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you feel safe now? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Uh, yeah, but I still suffer from nightmares and-- and fear if I pick up the paper and read a few criminal cases, I'm wondering who is going to knock on my door and cut my throat. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us, Mr. Baum? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah, I want to mention this one instance where the guard-- I was hit by another inmate as I was walking to the front of the line. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ABRAHAM BAUM: And he knocked me out, and I was so weak anyhow. And I lay down on the edge of this road until everyone went by. And then-- there were-- those were-- happened to be young guards, Germans. And when they end, all of them went by, and they see me laying on the end as they came by with their dog, and asked me what happened. I told them I got hit and I got knocked out. And so they say, well, what do you want to do? 

I say, I don't care. I can't walk no more, I say. 'Cause they told me, well, everything is so near, they say, don't you want to keep going, they say, and see your family, your father and your children, and make it to them? And they told the two prisoners to grab me by the arms and carry me home. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Two German guards? 

ABRAHAM BAUM: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did that give you renewed hope that people were-- 

ABRAHAM BAUM: It-- it left me with a little better feeling, yes. 

CREW: OK. [CLEARS THROAT] OK.
