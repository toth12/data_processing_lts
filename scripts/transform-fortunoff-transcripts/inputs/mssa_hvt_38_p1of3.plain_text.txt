SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: A neighbor of his was missing. I don't know whether I can you know what. Ask him about crying and the closest person. 3873920. 

INTERVIEWER 1: All right, you told-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: OK, My name is Libby Melamedic. I was born in Maniewicze. And I had five sisters, one brother. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Maniewicze. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Maniewicze, that was my town. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN Ukraine. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Ukraine. And I had five sisters and one brother. My father was dealing with wood. He was going to people and getting orders and selling to other towns, a lot of wood. And he knew a lot of Ukrainian people. And he was very good with them. 

They used to have once a week was such a bazaar. They used to go and buy all kinds of things. And the Ukrainian people used to come in our town. And they used to wanted-- they knew my father dealed with them, and they wanted to sleep in our house. And the barn that we put them up, it's straw and all kind of thing they should sleep. 

And they used to, sometimes we had our home, and they used to-- my father used to put them home to sleep too. And my sisters used to say, why, my god. Why do you think I just cleaned my house? And you're going to put them in, and they with the dirty shoes and everything. 

And my father used to say you'll never know when you're going to need them. You let better be good to them. And he treated them good. And he yelled on the kids they should be good to them. 

And you know, later, when I tell you, it shows that paid off to be good, you know. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Because when the Germans came in, you know, he really did, you know, that man really saved a lot of Jewish people. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: And he had, you know, he had like we were one home, next was my mother's sister and then another sister and then was my grandfather and grandmother. And my grandfather and grandmother were very religious. And they were very good-hearted. 

And every Friday we have-- was a lot of poor people. And the poor people, the [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] you know, with the tea was boiling Friday all day and all night for the poor people. When they come, they should have a hot glass of tea with a piece of sugar. Always was ready and feeding them. And everybody knew. 

And then once in a month used to come a big rabbi in our town from-- ours was a little town. So the rabbi came from a big town. And he stayed in my grandfather's house. 

And all the people came asking questions to him. And all the people came to ideas, you know, everybody was a big thing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember such a visit with such a-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: No, I don't remember. But I remember talking this. I remember, you know. 

And I remember he used to pull down a [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] you know. That rabbi from the whole little town used to come. And if somebody was sick and somebody were this. And everybody used to come asking questions and ask-- you know. I remember this was well-known like this. 

And then my father, his sister had a house next to us. And when it came Pesach, they used to hire people and bake matzah for the whole town. That's my sister-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many Jews were-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I don't know exactly. This I don't remember. I never ask, and I never knew. 

But I know that's my sister-- not my, my mother's sister's, husband. He used to deal with the matzah. And everybody used to come and buy matzah from him for Pesach. You know, he used to do this. 

And then one day, they stopped talking. All of a sudden, I hear they start talking that's Hitler's coming up. And Hitler's coming up. And they're killing Jews here and they're killing in other little towns. 

But we didn't believe it. One day, the Russian came. It was already the Russians. In '39 terrorists occupied our Ukraine. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were how old then? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I was I think probably about 12 or 11. I don't know, I was a little kid. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When the Russians-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: When the Russians took over in '39 our place. And the Russians started telling us that Hitler is killing people and killing people. But nobody knew. 

You have your house. You have, you know, we had cows. And we had all in the backyard growing everything. Who believed it? You know, till it didn't come to you, nobody believed it. 

So they put transports with empty transports and said all people who wants to come to Russia, who wants to come to Siberia, any place, come. We take you with everything. Just go. 

But nobody-- some people left. So they survived. My sister went. My sister and her husband. So they went in-- 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: In the Underground. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: No, no, no. They went away to Russia. [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] [NON-ENGLISH]. 

My older sister with her husband decide they going to go. Because my mother pushed her to go. She was pregnant. And she said that's-- you go away. We'll see. And nobody else wanted to go. 

And then they used-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: That was after the war broke out? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Yeah, just the German war. That's what the-- sure. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But that's 1941. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: '41. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you were how old then? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I don't remember. How old was I? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were born in what year? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: 1933. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So you were eight? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Nine years old. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Nine years old. I just remember that they all were talking and saying that Hitler is coming up, and Hitler is killing there. And one day it was a big [INAUDIBLE]. 

The Hitler, you know, they come in. And they start catching men. Just any man that they saw. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: You know, from the street. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: [INAUDIBLE] from the street. Just catching all the men. And-- 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Not all, all men. Jews. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Jews. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Anybody with a-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: With a beard. Jews. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Anybody who wore an armband. Well, they recognized, you know, in Jewish people, you could recognize someone. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: At that time, they didn't even wear armband yet. They just start to come in. And they said-- and you see what the Polish people. They didn't know who are Jewish. 

The Polish people used to come and show. Here is a Jew, here they took him. And show him around in each house to show where Jews are living. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember how the Russians left? And do you remember how the Germans came into the town? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I, I just-- this I don't remember. I just remember when I know that's used to, that's the-- say Germans come in, and they catching the Jews to go to work. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who's they? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: They'd insult him. All the people. They were hiding. Some of them in, you know, my father was that time out of town. 

And my mother was so scared she said if she knew, she would even you could hide him in a bed, cover him up, and he would survive. But he wasn't home. And he was just coming in from town on a horse [INAUDIBLE]. 

And they were ca--, they catched him. All-- they took him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember that? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I remember telling this. I don't, I didn't see it. I-- just my mother told us. 

Because I remember, this I remember, that she got dressed. With a lot of women where their husbands were taken, and she used to go look for them. Because people didn't say they killed him, they just said they sent them to work. They're working someplace, here and there. 

But they-- it wasn't, you know. So they got up in the morning. Every morning you used to go in this town, for weeks. 

And finally they came back and said they didn't find nothing. So they killed him. They took him right away and they probably killed him. But I didn't-- I didn't see it. But that's what happened. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your father returned from town and the Germans-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: They took him. They just-- they catched anybody they could just do with a beard. You know, the Jewish people, they knew. And on top of that, the Polish people used to show. This is a Jew, this is a Jew. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Point fingers. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Just point fingers. Like this they would never knew if it's a Jew. You know, because some don't look like Jewish, you know. So I know. And then we came, and my mother was very depressed. From that time when my father disappeared, she didn't want to do nothing. 

Because we had a lot of Ukrainians where we could survive. They used to come to us and say, come on, we going to take you. We're going to keep you on a [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] We're going to give you everything. Your father-- you were so good to us. 

She didn't have-- from that time, she didn't want to do nothing. She didn't want to-- she stayed home. 

One day, they start making like ghetto. So we had our town was two sides. One side and then another side where you passed the train was going by the-- to go-- Wie sogt man? 

INTERVIEWER 2: The tracks? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Track, yeah, tracks. So they took us from one side from the track to another side. And they made on one side a ghetto. And there they took all everybody. And they put down the ladders with, you know, everything. 

And I remember where we were that's we put away everything and we had to go to the ghetto. And my mother took me and my other sister and two more sisters. Because one sister was in Russia. And one brother was in hiding or in the Russian area-- I had a brother, but he was in the Russian area. So he went away long before. 

And so they took us there. We were all coming through. This I remember. And my mother said to us, run away. Because I don't believe they put us in a ghetto. I think they're going to kill us like they killed my father. And she said run away, kids. At least I know. Maybe I die knowing that somebody survived. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] I remember. This I remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In Yiddish, the words, do you remember? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Yeah. Un geyt antroyft [SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH]. Efsher [NON-ENGLISH] bleiben. And so because a train was going by, a zug. And me and [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] was a [SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH] a zug going to the front, Germans. 

And all the time when we were home, I go back, my mother, even my father used to tell us that I dealed with some goyim, and I gave him money and I gave him everything, and I gave him a lot of things. If somebody survive, you should go to this and this. 

We know his name. But because my father dealed with him. And he says, go to him, he'll try to save you. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the name? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: The name I don't remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The place? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I know it was in Adorf in Manevichy 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was it far away? 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Yeah, it was like-- not that far away, but far away. You know, you could walk miles and miles. But they-- in Europe you didn't-- not everybody had horses. You walked to a Adorf. 

I remember we would-- we had-- um, when the Germans, before they came in already, and we didn't have nothing to eat. And my mother used to go with a peckle of the places, we used to go to the goyim. Because they were so good-- the das and collect bread and this and bring to us to eat. And they were good, they gave it to us. 

So I mean, she went for a couple days. So it's like you could work there. But it's far. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where are you from? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Well, I was born in Czarnow. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And your name? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: My name is Sidney Glucksman. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Born? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: 19/7, '27. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: In Czarnow, Poland. What I remember is when the Germans-- when the war started off. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What about before? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Before? 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was the town like? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: I went to heder, and I went to school until the war broke out. I mean, that's all I remember. When the war-- you know, when I was 13. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was Czarnow like? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: It was a nice, beautiful small town, big Jewish population. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How, how big? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: About 30,000 Jews. And-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Out of how many? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Out of how many, all together maybe about 60-- maybe 58,000, 60,000. And it was a beautiful city. Everybody lived beautifully there until the Germans started-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What is-- what do you remember? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Beautiful. Beautiful culture. That's what I remember. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you have a theater? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: We had a theater. We had Jewish organizations. We had everything that you would think of, you know. I mean, nothing high class. But whatever we had, we had something to enjoy. The culture, the Jewish culture was beautiful. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember any plays that they used to do or-- in the evenings? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: In the evenings? Yes. We had-- we used to get, you know, Jewish kids, certain ages, like, let's say from 7 to 13, after school, we all would gather together. We would play together. 

And Saturdays we would go out and play together. We would go to the synagogues every Saturday. Because there were-- you know, it was a small city. Because we had the big Jewish population, there were a lot of [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] You know what that means? 

Like they used to send the Hasidim, who used to-- who wanted to get a good education, they would come to learn there in that city. And we had all different sects of those Jewish organizations-- or talmuds. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember any? Any names come to your mind? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Yes. Bobover Hasidism, Radomsko Hassidim. There were more. But I couldn't remember them all. 

I didn't go to them. But I-- you know, the cheder where I used to go to, that was right near by. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What was your teacher like at the cheder? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: My teacher was-- the Jewish teacher, you mean? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yes. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Or the teacher at school. 

INTERVIEWER 2: No, at the cheder. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: At the cheder there were very nice man. One we always used to make fun of because he used to speak with a-- he was a Litvak. And I am a Galician, like, you know. They had a different accent. And we used to kid him around because of it. 

And it was very nice till the time came, you know, from nowhere. We went to sleep one night. And all of a sudden, at one night, we could hear gunshots. 

You know, the houses were very small in that city. And everything is-- was shaking. We knew that there must have been some-- that the Germans are nearing. And they came in that evening. 

And in the morning, you know, like a child is, you want to go out and see what's going on. We came out from the house. We saw Polish soldiers spread out all over the sidewalks, the roads, and every other place. Death. 

Tanks in the middle of the street. Nobody in it. And we saw the Germans starting already to go around and looking at the buildings, or looking for Polish soldiers or whatever. 

And when we came out at that morning, we had nothing to eat. So we wanted to go to see if he can get something to eat. All the bakeries were closed. 

And we went back like nothing. Nobody bothered us. The German soldiers didn't bother us until five days or six days later. They went from house to house, looking for Jewish people. 

And I was sitting in my house like any other day. And I heard their footsteps. Because the Germans soldiers, they had those heavy boots with the nails underneath. And when they walked up steps, you could hear the, you know, the panic. 

They came in. They asked for who lives here. And I-- my brother, my older brother got up, and he says it's me, my father, my mother, and one other brother, a younger brother. 

He picked out my brother. He was the older brother. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Oh, he was at that time I would say about 24, maybe 25. And he was the head of the house really. Because my father was sick already. So I didn't want him to go. 

And at that time, I said to the German soldiers when they came in, I says, how about you take me instead of him. They agreed on it. And they took me away. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And how old were you? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: 13. They took me away to camp-- to an Arbeit camp. And that was-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You mentioned your family. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No-- and your brothers and father. Can you say a little bit about-- 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: My brother and father was there. They didn't care for the older people. 

INTERVIEWER 1: About the family, before the war. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: My father was a tailor. My mother was just a housewife. And when I-- when they agreed to take me-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was it like at home? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: It was like a nice Jewish home. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember what any room looked like in particular? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Like, well, how can I explain? You know, like-- like a nice warm home. You know, warm house, being greeted. 

Everybody, you know whoever came over, we had friends coming over all the time. We used to play cards. We used to have a real nice-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] You know, it's everything nice and close. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your father who sold, who were the clients? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: The clients? Whoever could afford it to have a suit made to order. A lot of Hasidim. 

They used to have those black satin long coats that they used to wear on Shabbos. You know, the Khalatin You must have seen those here too. And most of them, we used to make them. That was very nice. 

INTERVIEWER 1: He worked alone? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: No, no, no. My brother helped him. I helped when I was 7 years old, I was already sewing. I came home from school. I would sit down, I would help. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: That's why you don't have too many tailors, good ones. You learned home. [LAUGHTER] 

You And you know, everything was really beautiful until-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were Shabosim or Yon-Tevim like? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Well, Shabosim, on Shabbos we went to the synagogues. We had Shtiblekh there, you know. And all the kids, I would say 99% of the Jewish kids, they would go with their parents. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Yeah. [? [SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH] ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe your Shabbos, going with your parents to shul? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Yes. I remember as a child you-- I could-- you weren't allowed to carry a tallis or a siddur on Shabbos, if there was no air-- you know, what they-- Eyrev? You know, a special way a wire, a certain wire had to be from stretched from one point of the city to the place where the synagogue, you know, towards the synagogue. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: They were religious. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: And if there-- if there wasn't that certain wire, so a child under 13 could carry your tallis. Otherwise, you would take the tallis and put it around your neck as it-- like a shawl, so you wouldn't have to carry it in your hands. But if you couldn't do this, you had to hire a little child under 13. 

If you didn't have your own child, you gave another child $0.05, five groshen or whatever it was, you know. And he would do this for you for a year or whatever, you know. And you-- he would get paid the five groshen for each Shabbos that he carries the tallis for you. You didn't have to carry it back because Shabbos after, you know, sundown, you could carry the tallis or the Khumesh or the siddur or whatever it was, you could carry it yourself. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And-- 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Then. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were the wire? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: They call it the Eyrev. You know, it's-- it's a-- that's what I remember. But they told me about it. 

You know, there's a name for it. And I think the name of it is an eyrev An-- that's, that's, that's what I think. And I'm pretty sure. I can-- you can find out this from a rabbi maybe, what it means. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Does it stay up all week? Or it's just-- 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: No, no, no. This is for-- no, for not just for one week. For a year or for how long the Jewish people were there. As long as there's a synagogue from a, from a certain place of the town to there, you know. That's how it worked. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And is that the area you were allowed to carry things in. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Right. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: In each area was your own synagogue. Not too far. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But outside of that area, you couldn't carry. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: You couldn't carry it yourself on the Shabbos. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Right. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Just on the Shabbos or an high holiday. You know, if there was [? [NON-ENGLISH]-- ?] you know, they call it [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] or Passover. At that certain time, you can do it. But not at the Shabbos or Yom Kippur or Rosh Hashana or something like this. 

You're not allowed, according to the rule-- maybe that's the orthodox way. I don't know. I never did really look into it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And Yom Kippur? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Same thing. Same thing. Like I remember-- at yontef, you know, like Yom Kippur, that synagogue what we belonged to, it was sort of orthodox, I would say. Because when you came in Yom Kippur for Kol Nidray, the tables and the chairs, they weren't set up to sit in. The chairs would be turned over. You-- you should sit low. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Like on stairs. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: You know. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Right. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: And you wouldn't walk in shoes. You would walk in slippers or stockings. And because that synagogue was not-- you know, it was more like made over, maybe from a house, and there were concrete floors that would spread out, hay or straw. So you shouldn't have to walk, you know, with your feet on the bare floor or so on. 

It was very interesting. And at Yom Kippur there would everybody who belonged to the synagogue would carry one big candle. That candle would light 24 hours. It must have been like 36 inches long, an inch and a half thick. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Until next day. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: You know, that candle would burn for 24 hours. That's for Yom Kippur. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was there a special meaning to that candle? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Yes. You know, it's like-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I like-- 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: You know, it's a Yahrzeit. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: A Yahrzeit. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: But because it's of Yom Kippur, you light this for anybody. Everybody has somebody who is-- who has-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Who died. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Who died. You know, some kind of a relative. So everybody would put one in. And we had boxes, long boxes filled with sand. And you put the candle in that box, you know, in the sand, to make it stay. And if it drips, it drips in the sand. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: That was fast. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: And that-- it was the same thing. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Yeah, we've had the same thing 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: It was, it was sort of different than you see it here, now. But it was 50 years ago, I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What about what was your father, what kind of a man was he? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Very nice. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mother? Something about them. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Well, yes, I would say so. They were from. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was there a mikvah in your town? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Oh yes, I went even to the mikvah myself. Every Friday my father would go. I would go with him. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: I went with my mother too. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Most older Jewish fathers, they would take their boys, their little boys, you know, by the hand. If he had one or 15. Everybody from the boys would go with the father to the mikvah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What did it look like? How, how was it to be there? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: It was like, I would say, like a steam bath here, like a Russian steam bath. And you walk into a place-- it's, I would say, almost like what would you call this, like we have in Jewish center here, you know. A big, open space. 

We would have steps to climb up, what higher you went, the most-- the hotter it got. Then you had on one side cold water to walk into the basement-- it looked like a basement, which it was not the basement. It looked like you were walking in here to a basement floor, you know. If you have in your house from the kitchen a door that you can downstairs. 

But this would-- this how the mikvah would look. It was filled with water. On one side, warm water, the other side, cold water. Who wanted warm water could go into the warm water. And whoever wanted cold water goes in the cold water. 

Then you went out from there. And you walked up to the shvits, you know, on the steps. And there were some guys working in that particular mikvah. But they gave you a rub-- not a-- here they give you a rubdown. 

There they had like a broom made of certain leaves from a tree. And it's made like a little-- like a little hand broom, but big. And they would give you-- you know, they would a shellacking like on your back, you know, until you really get red. You know, for circulation. So it was very interesting, but-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember as a boy talking to your father, thinking about your father? What would you say to each other? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: What does a boy have to say to a father? I mean, you-- whatever you felt, you said. You wanted to go someplace, you went over to your father, and you-- you know, everything was very close. You asked your father for anything they would do. 

If I would-- I couldn't have asked him for anything to go out and play with me. Because he was busy all day working. I was busy all day with school. 

I had to go in the morning to the cheder. I came home from cheder, I had to go to school. I came home from school, I had to sit down by the machine and sew. So there wasn't too much-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: To talk. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: To, to play or anything else, right, in between. In the evening, when we got off from work, you know, or on a holiday, everybody sits put together at the table. And then you can talk and you can ask and do things, you know, whatever you want to-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you have any talks with your parents, either father or mother? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Of, of what? I don't, like-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Something special. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Nothing special that I remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Singing together? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Oh, at Shabbos, yes. Shabbos after, you know, Havdalah. Yes, we would sing together. 

And then we had another-- some other people that were-- that lived in the same building. There were more orthodox, every Saturday after sundown. We would go to them. 

And he makes, you know, like a shaleshudes here. Same thing. And everybody was happy, singing and eating and everything. It was very, very interesting. The way of living, I would say. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any friends you remember from that time? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: My friends? Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Particular friends. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Particular friends. I-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: You had that friend who you just met him. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: I just met one friend after 30 years I didn't see him. And I was in the Catskills two years ago. And the guy walks in the hotel. 

And I says to my wife, I says I think I know this guy. And I point at him. He was away, maybe about 20 feet. 

All of a sudden, he starts staring at me. And we walked-- you know, I walked towards him, he walked towards me. And I says, aren't you so and so? 

He says, yes. Now, he says, I'm going to tell you who you are. And he tell me my name. 

We both want to heder together. We both went to concentration camp together. And we didn't see each other for 30 years. 30 years later, we met him here. And he lives in Brazil. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: In Argentina. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: And you know, I've-- I had a lot of friends there that-- but like I say, you know, at 13 we broke-- some of them we went-- we went together to prison from our town, a lot of our young guys. And a lot of them died. In a place of-- that was Saltptalzburg. We had typhoid. 

You never heard of Saltptalzburg. That was a-- not a concentration camp. It was a arbeitslager. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Germans took you from home. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: From home, yes. But that was-- they took me from home. I didn't go to Saltptalzburg right away. I went to Langenbielau. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And that was what year? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: This was in 1939. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Couldn't be. The war was in '41. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: The Germans came into our city in 1939. Three months later-- 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Really? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: I was taken away. 

LIBBY GLUCKSMAN: Maybe to you earlier. To us in '41. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: And they took me away to be Langenbielau. That was an arbeitslager. And they says that-- when they, when they took me away, they said that every Saturday, I'm going to be able to come home. And Monday I should go back to work. And they took me away. There was no way of coming back home. 

I got home six or seven months later because I-- they put me to work to build. They started off in Oberschlesien the German autobahn. And because I was very young, they gave me a job-- which it was easy to handle, that's what they thought-- to couple on the train, you know with the senth little wagons. 

That happened to be in the winter. No glove, no-- we had wooden slippers. And my hand got stuck when I was picking up that heavy chain to throw over, to hitch up the other, the other car. My hand got stuck right in between those two chains. 

I didn't feel anything. The train came down. And I pulled out my hand. It looked like spaghetti. 

That finger got caught right in there. And it tore it off. See this? And I had blood poisoning from it two days later. 

Because I got blood poisoned, they sent me home. Not home, they sent me back to Poland. And they kept me there in a place that was like Durchgangslager. You understand what that means? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Transit camp. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Right. When they-- when they caught some more Jews, they would bring him to that place. When they had some sick Jews from the arbeitslager, they would bring him back there. 

Somehow there was no way of really easy, you know, to be able to come out from there. And I saw that I was there two weeks already. They were healing up. You know, they put some stuff on the hand to heal it up. 

And I thought to myself that I'm so close to my home, there must be a way of escaping. I went out and I looked around. I saw Stormtroopers. You know, the black uniforms with the hakenkreuz on the armband. 

And I didn't care, really, what's going to happen to me at that time. You know, I was-- I didn't care. Because I knew that as soon this hand is going to get better, they're going to ship me back. 

So I went out, and I went downstairs. And I asked one of the storm troopers if he needs anything to be sewn. One guy says yes, I should make him a new band with a hakenkreuz. 

I did. I saw a bicycle near his door. And I looked around, I see that there is a way to grab a bicycle and to sneak away. I didn't wear a uniform, because we didn't wear uniforms at that time. We wear civilian clothes. 

And I grabbed the bicycle. And I had from that place to my home town 25 to 30 kilometers. And I was pedaling 25 or 30 kilometers on that bicycle. And nobody caught on the part. 

I came home. The whole city was surprised. They heard that I came home. 

And everybody from the city-- from the Jewish people, you know, like the older people that was still left-- everybody came into my house to ask, did you see my son? Do you know anything about my son? Did you see my husband? Did you see my father? 

A lot of them I had to tell the real truth. A lot of them didn't make more than-- you saw him the one day, the next day he was dead. Some of them, they couldn't take it. 

Some of them took something to kill themselves. Some of them took cement from the cement bags. They threw in their eyes to blind themselves. And-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You saw this? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: I-- huh? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You saw this? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: I saw that-- all that I saw with my own eyes. A lot of them took their hand in between two chairs and break it themselves, so that because there was a certain time from those working camps, if you had like a broken arm or blood poisoning or something like this, they says that they're going to send you home. 

They never did send anybody home. As far as you could go is to that [? [GERMAN]. ?] And that was it. 

And I was home at that time maybe about six or seven weeks. Then I hear footsteps again. And I knew the Germans are going around again, looking for people. 

I thought to myself here I am home. They didn't catch me. They didn't know anything about me, why I went from the [? [GERMAN]. ?] And my hand is still not all right, they wouldn't take me. 

So I was sitting in my home, in the kitchen. Meanwhile, I took my brother, my older brother. And I brought him down. 

In this house where we lived, right next door was a place where they used to smoke salamis. You know, it was like a smokehouse. So I pushed him down in that smokehouse into like a chimney that had bars going across, in that, you know, where it smokes. 

And I told him, crawl in there. The Germans are never going to go looking for you in there. They came in, they asked for his name. This is already you know, months later. And I says he is not here. 

So they says, you come along. And they took me away. At that time that took me away, and they sent me away to Sal-, to Graz. 

And this was not too bad yet. What we did at that time was unloading what the Germans took away from Poland, from Czechoslovakia and from part of Russia already-- their tanks, cannons and all that stuff. That's what we used to do. 

But most of the time, we had to do very dangerous work. Like they had those field wagons where they had the-- you know, the-- for the cannons, the-- not, you don't call them bullets. You know-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Balls? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: Huh? 

INTERVIEWER 2: The balls? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: But you know, what you shoot the-- what you shoot from in a cannon with. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Ammunition. 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: You know, the heavy ammunition. Each one was made-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Shells? 

SIDNEY GLUCKSMAN: The shells, that's it. They were like at least 30 inches or longer, six or eight of them in one wagon. The wagon was-- it used to be shot through, you know, hit by shrapnels. 

The steel from it would be caught in between those things, which it was very dangerous. And that was our job to take them apart. Because the Germans would use them over. 

We were trying to do as much sabotage as we could. You didn't care what's going to happen to us. If you're going to get shot or we going to get killed at the job, we didn't care because--
