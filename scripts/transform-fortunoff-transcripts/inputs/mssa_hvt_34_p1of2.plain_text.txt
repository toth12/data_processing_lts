INTERVIEWER 1: We're rolling. Is this wind sound all right? Well, why don't we start back, Jolly and you tell us about where you lived and, uh-- with your mother, and a little bit, if your mother will talk about her family. 

SUBJECT 1: I was born in Czechoslovakia, in Uzhorod, which was the eastern part of Czechoslovakia. The size about 40,000, 50,000 people. Very much similar to the community that I live in now, which is Fairview, Connecticut. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And your mother, can you tell me, Mrs. Weisner, what was your life like? Tell me about your family. 

SUBJECT 2: In Uzhorod? 

SUBJECT 1: Mm-hm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hm. 

SUBJECT 2: Very wealthy, very nice. It was a happy marriage. And I have my daughter and a son. My son wasn't allowed he should go in the-- in the-- in the college, in the high school. I sent him to Israel. And he went into school in Israel. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When was this? 

SUBJECT 2: In '30-- in '38, when the Hungarians occupied Uzhorod. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your son was not allowed to go to college. 

SUBJECT 2: No. He went into textile-- textile school. 

SUBJECT 1: My brother was studying in Czechoslovakia, but in western Czechoslovakia. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: And that was not occupied until '39. But just three days before he fled came, the Jewish students sensed that something is happening. And they escaped down to Romania and tried to go to Israel. But in Israel those days, they wouldn't allow them to get in. And they shot at them, the English did. 

So they were turned back. And they were on the sea for week, months, where some people died, gave birth, got married. Finally they got back to Greece, where they hired another boat and made the attempt again and got to Israel this time, somehow at night they managed to. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So you did not know where your son was for many, many months? 

SUBJECT 2: Eight years. 

SUBJECT 1: No, for years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Eight years? 

SUBJECT 2: Eight years I didn't know from him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you-- when did you finally hear from him? 

SUBJECT 2: After the war, when I come from concentration. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You mean your son left you in 1938. 

SUBJECT 1: '38. 

SUBJECT 2: '38. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you didn't hear from him until 1946? 

SUBJECT 1: '45. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Then you were-- and then you found he was in Israel? 

SUBJECT 1: In Israel. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. I write a letter in a kibbutz. And the kibbutz found him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And it wasn't in Israel then. It was-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened? 

SUBJECT 1: By the way, all his friends, who did not manage to get away, all of them were killed. 

SUBJECT 2: All of them. 

SUBJECT 1: Not one survived in his age group, because those were the ones who were taken before even the families were taken. The young men were taken to labor camps. And none of his friends who stayed survived, none of them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When, uh-- when did you start to feel the trouble, uh, after your son left? What happened? 

SUBJECT 2: We were in the Hungarian-occupied towns in country. And this was very bad, you know? A Jew couldn't go shopping and this. This was very bad under the-- under Hungarian regime, too, for the Jews. 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you couldn't go shopping, how did you prepare meals for your children? 

SUBJECT 2: After 10 o'clock, a Jew could go. 

INTERVIEWER 1: After 10 o'clock? 

SUBJECT 2: Yes, in the morning. 

SUBJECT 1: There were certain curfews later. But in '38, when the Hungarians occupied that part of Czechoslovakia, while we were not deported, the process of dehumanization really started already. My father's business was taken away, and our former housekeeper was put in charge. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I would like to know what happened when they took your husband's business away? Do you remember what happened? What-- exactly what took place? 

SUBJECT 2: I had a janitor, and I told her she should take out the paper. That she should take over my store. And I was just like zamÄ›stnanec-- 

SUBJECT 1: An employee. 

SUBJECT 2: --employee. And she was the boss. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were working in a-- you owned a store? 

SUBJECT 2: Our own store. But she was the boss. 

SUBJECT 1: She did not own it anymore. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. But before that you owned a store. And then one day, what happened? Can you describe it? 

SUBJECT 2: They took it away from us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who took it away? 

SUBJECT 1: The Hungarians. 

SUBJECT 2: The Hungarians. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well, can you describe how they took it? What exactly happened? 

SUBJECT 2: Actually, I'm sorry. We get a paper. Until this and this month, you had to give over for Aryan of this store. Aryan, this means for a Gentile this store. 

INTERVIEWER 1: An Aryan? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And so you were in your store, and what happened? 

SUBJECT 2: I was in the store, like an employer. But where a Jew employer is have to be an Ar-- a Gentile employer. So I had a very good friend. If she give it to her daughter, and she was employed. But-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: So you gave it to this friend of yours' daughter to be the owner. 

SUBJECT 2: My janitor, it was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your janitor. 

SUBJECT 2: The janitor. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You could give it to who you wanted to give it? 

SUBJECT 1: No. 

SUBJECT 2: No. 

SUBJECT 1: People applied. But in this case, since we knew this woman, she was working for us, she applied. And she managed the store from then on. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well, what did you think? What did you feel when the janitor was now your boss? 

SUBJECT 2: She was wonderful. It took her to lots of time she should tell the truth, the store is mine and not hers. She said it's not true the store is hers because they closed mostly the Jewish stores. But they have a-- a Gentile for, but not mine. Until the last moment she was lying, she was-- she said. 

But when I arrived home, she didn't give it me nothing. I left her money. And I left her a store with-- that's all. After, she don't give us. She said the Russia took it away, everything from her. 

SUBJECT 1: Well, I understand. I heard that she mismanaged it. And shortly after we were gone, the store was also gone, just through sheer mismanagement. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said you were gone. What happened? What do you mean you were gone? 

SUBJECT 2: Who was gone? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said that you left. Were did you go? What happened? 

SUBJECT 2: The-- the gendarme come from-- for us and we went like-- like the Kuh to the Schlachthaus. I don't know how to say in-- in English. Still took us to the train, and that's all. And from the train, to Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Didn't you have to pack up your-- 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, pardon. We was three weeks in ghetto and then to the train. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What I'm trying to find out is what it was like for you. There were very few people who are your age who experienced what you experienced, who can still tell us about it from the way you saw it. Your daughter saw it as a younger person. You saw it as a mother, as a wife, as a person of great responsibility. And I'm trying to have you tell us the story as you saw it in specific, exact ways. 

SUBJECT 2: We didn't believe it, they take us to killing. They take us to the work. We didn't know until we were in Auschwitz two days. After that, I know they took us to the burning. We didn't know. Everybody said they take us to work. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Let's go back to 1938. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You felt-- what did you feel then? You sent your son away to school. And you felt-- what did you experience? Did you have to pack things in your house? What did you do? 

SUBJECT 2: I went every day to the store with my things. And the business was wonderful. And she was good. And I was heartbroke. We had to leave in-- in-- in-- you know? We were afraid. This wasn't life anymore. We were-- we were happy to be in ghetto already. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mrs. Weisner 

SUBJECT 2: All Jews together. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Afraid of what? What began changing? 

SUBJECT 2: Because the-- the Hungarians. They did beated the Jews. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You saw that happening? 

SUBJECT 2: Well, my neighbor come home. He had a-- a chocolate store. He was all over beaten with-- with blood, a man from 65 years, yes. And I was-- we were afraid from the Hungarian soldiers. They rob us. They-- it wasn't life anymore. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And other Czech people, what did-- how did they-- 

SUBJECT 2: Wonderful. 

SUBJECT 1: The Czechs were not there anymore because they left in '38. 

INTERVIEWER 2: All? The whole population? 

SUBJECT 1: Right. No. 

SUBJECT 2: Jew. 

SUBJECT 1: No, those who were Czech left in '38, and the Hungarian Army marched in. 

SUBJECT 2: The Czechs were wonderful. 

SUBJECT 1: The Czechs were-- I mean, they were not involved at all with us in this process. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did they go? 

SUBJECT 1: To Czechoslovakia. This is was only part of Czechoslovakia, the eastern part, which was given to Hungary in order to cooperate with Hitler. The Hungarians always wanted this part, but it was-- it was taken away from them in 1918 in Trianon at the peace treaty, Czechoslovakia was formed. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why didn't the Jews leave with Czechs? 

SUBJECT 1: Most of the Jewish population was there for centuries and generations. And they really-- I was a typically so-called Czech generation. But my parents were Hungarians because they were born before the Czechoslovakia was really born. 

SUBJECT 2: Three generations were born there. Where should we go? 

INTERVIEWER 2: And what-- doing what, these generation, what kind of business or-- 

SUBJECT 2: We had a clothing business. 

SUBJECT 1: But my grandfather was a farmer, and, uh, they lived in villages. And of course, there were there for generations. So my father really considered himself Hungarian, while I considered myself Czech because I was a product of the new Czech Republic. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you separated from your husband at all? Or did he stay with you? 

SUBJECT 2: hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well, when you were in your town-- 

SUBJECT 2: We were together at our home, sure. I had my nice home, everything. But he was very heartbroken. I have to go, and he couldn't do nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What-- what does that mean? When you had to go where? 

SUBJECT 2: In the store. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You mean they didn't let him work? 

SUBJECT 1: No. 

SUBJECT 2: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh. 

SUBJECT 2: We didn't work on that street never. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well, when did that start, that he wasn't permitted to work? 

SUBJECT 2: After they took it away from our-- from us, the right we should have us a store. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And then they said your husband couldn't work anymore. 

SUBJECT 2: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That he had to stay home? 

SUBJECT 2: Home, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And what did he do? 

SUBJECT 2: He cleaned. A Jew wasn't supposed to have a Gentile maid. So I haven't got a maid anymore. So my husband cleaned, and he worked. He worked. 

SUBJECT 1: And kept going to the doctor to check his ever-rising blood pressure he was getting sicker and sicker. 

SUBJECT 2: He wasn't well anymore. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you talk about with your husband when you came home from work? 

SUBJECT 2: I always told him don't stay forever, just get a chance. Just get better. I'm sure he-- but he always said who knows? He believed me, you know? 

SUBJECT 1: and survive. 

SUBJECT 2: oh he survive until he gets a chance. We always pray to the Lord, you know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you-- were you the only child at home? 

SUBJECT 1: No, I had a brother, as I mentioned. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No, but, I mean, he was-- people 

SUBJECT 1: Oh. by then, yes. 

SUBJECT 2: She was the only, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And so then you said that you didn't like living there anymore. You were glad to go to the ghetto. Where was the ghetto? 

SUBJECT 2: At the end, was terrible. We were afraid to go out in the street and everything. I meant that all Jews were happy to be together. What happened, happened. We are all together. 

SUBJECT 1: My mother's 93 already in '44. And it was now occupied by the Germans. And the restriction became worse and worse. 

SUBJECT 2: Worse and worse. 

SUBJECT 1: --once the Germans came. 

SUBJECT 2: One night, I took her in the cellar to sleep my daughter. A neighbor said, over there is a nice young girl. So I was afraid. She wouldn't get in the cellar. It was two days overnight. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The pictures you have with you, Jolly they were taken when? 

SUBJECT 1: As I mentioned before, um, Jewish children were not allowed to higher public schools-- into higher public schools. And I was attending gymnasium. So I went to a Hebrew gymnasium. And this is the uniform of that Hebrew gymnasium. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hold it up a little more and very still. That was that-- the hat that you wore. 

SUBJECT 1: The hat, right. This was the uniform of the school, the hat. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old were you then? 

SUBJECT 1: I am here probably around 15. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: About 15. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And the picture with your mother? 

SUBJECT 1: This picture was probably taken one or two years-- 

SUBJECT 2: Two years. 

SUBJECT 1: --before, uh, we were taken. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This was-- what-- you were-- but the Hungarians had already come in. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: Yes, but you were allowed to take-- this was taken by a Jewish photographer who-- 

SUBJECT 2: A Jewish photographer 

SUBJECT 1: --still worked on his own. And, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You both look very healthy and very happy, but you were not living very well at that time. 

SUBJECT 1: Well, when you say not well, it was primarily emotionally, psychologically. But, uh, physically, we had still our home and food. Uh, so in the sense, we still lived well. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What was it like to be a Czech girl before it all started? What did you do? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. Are you speaking now about the peace times? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Peace times. 

SUBJECT 1: We had a beautiful life, very family-oriented. Uh, my father and mother lived only for their children and each other, very, very family-oriented. 

SUBJECT 2: Very. 

SUBJECT 1: Um, my brother was attending, uh, college in Brno, which was western Czechoslovakia. But, uh, in a way, my father was hoping that it will become Hungary because he felt as a Hungarian. So the disappointment was terrible when the Hungarians came in and, uh, whatever followed. But these were not the Hungarians he remembered from way back. This was a new generation with very racial prejudice and with the Hungarian government's new policy. And all the young man, right away, were taken into labor camps. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Before it began-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: --how did you spend evenings, weekends, sports, friends? As a young-- what's a young Czech girl? 

SUBJECT 2: They took my children away. 

SUBJECT 1: Well, uh, just anywhere else, there was no television. So it was mainly among friends. I was a student, so it was mostly school and then homework in the afternoon. And Saturday, Sunday either reading or meeting with friends. But a very, very happy childhood. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you said that's why your son went away. So what did you mean by that? You just said-- 

SUBJECT 2: He said I-- I am a human being. Then it's OK. But I didn't let him out because I was afraid. When he saw somebody, a soldier, a Jew, he would go, and he wouldn't let. So I was sure they'd kill him. I said, better go away. All right, Mom. Human being or not, now I try to go to Israel. But not-- he didn't want it. 

SUBJECT 1: There was a little incident that stands out in my mind. My brother came home from Brno, from Czechoslovakia, to visit for Christmas in '38. This was his first encounter with the Hungarian soldiers. 

We went out for a family walk, which we did every Sunday afternoon. And a Hungarian-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: This is where? 

SUBJECT 1: Just, uh, on next-by streets. And a Hungarian officer, Sunday morning, as we passed by, he put up his boot and pulled a Jewish boy by his, uh, sideburns and grabbed him. And he said, here, you Jew. Clean my boots. And we were noticing this from the other side of the street. And my brother, being 18, idealistic, lived in a very democratic Czech era, he couldn't take this. And he wanted to run over and fight with the Hungarian officer. 

So my father and mother grabbed him. And my mother started to cry, please don't. Please don't. I mean, they'll overwhelm you. They are soldiers all over around, and you can't win. And I start-- started to join in with my mother crying. We begged him. 

So we turn back home. My brother was shaking. And my father turned to him and he said, my son, I understand you. But I think you better leave because you cannot stay here anymore. And a month later he did leave, and that was the last time we were all together. This was in '39, January. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember the date? 

SUBJECT 1: Not necessarily the date, but it was January '39. This was the last time, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember the time-- the day of his leaving , can't remember? 

SUBJECT 1: Well, in the evening-- he had to go at night through the border because the Hungarians were already on the border, and they-- you couldn't go legally to-- so he had to carry on himself whatever he could. Way And he took several coats and jackets and everything, and, um, he left at night to the borders. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember what you felt when he left that night? Do you remember what you-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, I remember very good. The next day I had an attack. And the doctor said I had gallstone attack. And from that day, I suffered. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you help him pack? 

SUBJECT 1: Well, he couldn't take anything because he had to crawl at night. 

SUBJECT 2: Couldn't take nothing. Just I give it him money. He should have the three years in the school. 

SUBJECT 1: But of course he couldn't finish school because-- 

SUBJECT 2: You know, in the-- in the-- on the border they said, hand up. He look at him, and he had here the money , and here the money. And he had it all over here dollars, you know? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You mean the Hungarian money? 

SUBJECT 1: Well, my parents probably had some saved money, maybe in dollars also. 

SUBJECT 2: Hungarian money wasn't good. 

SUBJECT 1: And, um-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Hungarian money wasn't good. Is that what you're saying, no? 

SUBJECT 1: Well, if you went abroad, it helped if you had dollars to exchange into any currency rather than-- Hungarian money wasn't too easy to exchange once you left the country. And my parents thought that he might be able to continue his studies. But he wasn't because in '39, the Germans did occupy western Czechoslovakia. And as I said, he escaped three days before the Germans came. 

INTERVIEWER 1: As a mother, what were you thinking about? As a mother, how did you feel? What did you think? How could you take it? 

SUBJECT 2: In that time how I take it is there's no question not. I can't answer you-- bitter, and that's all. We just cried day and night. wh-- where my son is. I wasn't sure if he's alive or not. And, uh, but we still have our home, and we haven't got, uh, uh, worry about the financially. So we live. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Who decided that he should go? 

SUBJECT 1: Pardon me? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Who really decided that he should go? 

SUBJECT 1: My brother first. 

SUBJECT 2: Himself. 

SUBJECT 1: But my father supported it because he realized that my brother would get into trouble because he wouldn't be able to-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: And what father said, that was it, or? 

SUBJECT 1: No. My brother wanted to go. So they both realized. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah He was a very smart boy. 

SUBJECT 1: We all realized that, uh, he wouldn't last long with his views. He wouldn't be able to watch these scenes or take these things that were happening. So we all realized that he's better off going back-- or back to Czechoslovakia. It still existed then, not much longer. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you went to the ghetto, how far away was that? And did you pack things to take with you? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, we-- we packed, you know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you learn-- start at the beginning. Start at the beginning how you learned you were going to go to the ghetto, what you felt about going to the ghetto, and what you packed to take with you. 

SUBJECT 2: We took pillows, and we took it to eat. And it was men who were working in ghetto, so I always mind who get-- take it over my store. Her husband was working in ghetto. And always told him what he should buy and what he should bring. So he bring it every day now. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where was the ghetto in relation to-- 

SUBJECT 1: In our town, there was a brick factory, which was on a large territory. And it has its own enclosure, so they used that for a ghetto. They had some tents there. In the very barracks that were used for bricks, that's where we were staying. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Wait, go back to that day. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can we pause for one minute? We're obviously having a microphone problem. 

CREW: Uhm. I'm going to put a microphone on this. 

I want-- I want to ask 

SUBJECT 1: This was very important question that you asked. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah, that's what I thought. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: When you do, tell me, because now I-- you know, this is-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: And we, you and I, would perceive things differently at our age than she would have at that age. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, I will now bring it in. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK, all right. OK. 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. Just, uh, will he tell me when? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes. He'll say when. 

CREW: Yeah, we're ready. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. 

SUBJECT 1: I think the first real shock came when we were in the ghetto. But I like to just mention one incident before the ghetto. I was young, at the peak of idealism. My parents were older and knew better what life was about and didn't want to go in the ghetto. 

Although they didn't think that anything worse than working is coming, they still feared for my life. And I was hiding with the bishop in our town who lived in castle. He was very, very good to me. But I couldn't eat because I kept thinking of my parents and possibly I could help them if I would go with them. 

So I begged him to let me go back to my parents. And he tried to talk me out of it. I did appreciate it. But he understood. And at night, because Jews were by then not allowed on the street because these were the days already when they were being gathered into the ghettos. 

So at night, wrapped in a big coat, I was taken home. And within a day or two, I don't remember specifically, they did come for us. And there is one-- one, um, little incident that stands out always in my memory. My mother loved flowers. And she took all the flowers out from the house because she knew that within an hour or two we'd be gone. 

But she was convinced that we will come back. So she put them all out, that the rain should water them, so when we come back we'll find them. This shows you how convinced we all were that we will come back. 

Now, being a student in the Hebrew gymnasium I was asked-- when they were gathering from the surrounding villages the Jews, they were bringing them into the city before they took us. And we, the students from this Hebrew gymnasium, were registering them. And then I saw this inhuman way they behaved with these people, throwing old people around in ditches and, um, kicking them. 

It was my first encounter with something like this. And I remember for just a split second something went through my mind. That was the only time that maybe something terrible is coming. Maybe we shouldn't trust it. 

But this was the only time that this went through my head, never again. And, um, then when we were taken-- you remember the scene from the Holocaust movie? There was a scene where the mother and daughter sits down to the piano? 

Well, this was for me a very revealing moment on-- on that film, because it showed me the universality of human nature. I thought that it was my unique experience, because I also sat down to the piano while the guards were already standing, waiting for us. And with the arrogance and idealism of a 17 year old, I sat down to the piano and started to sing "let's love each other. Life is too short. The grave will close us all us in, so let's love each other." And I turned around, and I saw the face on the guard. And with my 17 years old, I tried to figure out if he's-- if he hates me or does he pity me maybe? And now in retrospect, I think it was maybe the mixture of both. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember that song? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you sing it? 

SUBJECT 1: [SINGING IN NON-ENGLISH] 

SUBJECT 2: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] 

SUBJECT 1: My mother says that I played the hatikva after that. Um, I don't remember it. But she said that I played. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, she played hatikva. 

SUBJECT 1: And we picked our little bundles and were marched. This was a long walk. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Just a moment. Sarah, what did you say? 

CREW: There was an airplane. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh, there was an airplane. Would you mind-- and, Lisa, would you make sure that we can hear the song. 

SUBJECT 1: Gee, I'm not a singer. This is the first time I sang for years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well. You know, you got to use your own , you know. 

SUBJECT 1: And where did we... 

INTERVIEWER 1: I want you to know it didn't cut off. It's just the airplane. And I'm going to just ask you the question to sing. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes, I forgot to tell you. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What? What? 

INTERVIEWER 2: You should ask less. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Ask us? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Ask less. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes, I think we should ask less. 

SUBJECT 2: I have something I have to tell you. Before the took us in ghetto, they took us control of when our health good. For everybody they controlled when our health good. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So, then. Tell us when. Good? 

CREW: Yeah, we're ready. 

INTERVIEWER 1: All right. You were talking about the Holocaust film and why you thought you had a unique experience and you hadn't, in a way. 

SUBJECT 1: Well, I told my family, my children, what happened to me before they took us. And as we were watching in our living room this movie, the same incident occurred on this picture. And while people might have thought that this was a Hollywood touch, having the mother and daughter on that film playing the piano before they are taken, I screamed when I saw that. And I thought this shows the universality of human nature because the same thing happened to me. 

When the guards were there already in the room, I sat down to the piano. Maybe I was 17. I was arrogant but idealistic. And I sat down to the piano, and I played a very popular tune those days. And, um, then as all-- well, it's difficult to translate it. 

But it says something like, uh, that let's love each other. The heart is the biggest thing. Life is too short. The grave will all close us in. So why not love each other while we are here? And when I finished, I looked at the guard. 

I wasn't sure what his reaction will be. And I remember I couldn't figure out his face, whether he hated me or pitied me or maybe both. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Would you sing it, please, for us? 

SUBJECT 1: [SINGING NON-ENGLISH] 

(SPEAKING) And within in a few minutes, we were taken. It was a long march from the house to the ghetto. And I remember my father and mother was a little slower than me. And they stepped on the sidewalk accidentally. So one of the soldiers kicked them and said, you know the sidewalk is only for human beings not for animals, and kicked us off the sidewalk to march in the middle of the road. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember that? Do you remember-- 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you feel? 

SUBJECT 2: We were always in hope. We talked always to the Lord. He help us. He was always helping. It was from the gas chamber. And I said, children, we go home. They said, oh, Mrs. Rochman is-- she's from-- I said, don't worry, children. Just hide and we go home. I was always hoping. I never give it up. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Jolie you were singing and crying. What did you-- what went through your mind then? 

SUBJECT 1: That the same story still applies, that love is the biggest thing, in spite of what we went through. Same thing still applies. Life is too short for anything else Ah, my mother says that we hope-- never gave up up. This is true. My mother was a fighter. 

But she had a special cause. She had me there. And now being a mother myself, I realize the pain she must be through to watch her young child under these circumstances. She tells me that I told her once that I'm hungry. 

SUBJECT 2: Not once. Ma, I'm hungry. I said, what should I do? What should I give you? I have not a little water, no water either. 

SUBJECT 1: And you wanted to give me a piece of bread. 

SUBJECT 2: And so that night, when we get a piece of bread, so I cut the 12 pieces. I give it to her more with a piece. She said, Ma, you need that piece, too. No, I don't take it. We have survived. When you would give me more, then I'll lose you. So this was it. 

But we was in Auschwitz three weeks. 

SUBJECT 2: When we arrived to Auschwitz, a band was playing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Just from the ghetto? 

SUBJECT 2: No, no, by now my mother is talking about Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you say how you got there? 

SUBJECT 2: Well, from the ghetto, transfers really were leaving daily in these cattle cars. And, I don't know. We were second, third, or whichever cattle car-- 80, 90, 100 people jammed in these places. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Just waiting for the plane to go by, please. It is disturbing to me. Could you start again with the cattle cars? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Maybe you-- it's 1944. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you still were so hopeful? 

SUBJECT 2: Till the last minute, even in Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT 1: In Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT 1: Even in Auschwitz, um, we never gave up hope. When we arrived to Auschwitz-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You didn't know what was going on? 

SUBJECT 2: Not till the last minute. They eluded us till the last minute. When we arrived to Auschwitz, a band was playing. And my mother said, gee, you'll be able to play the piano here. 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

SUBJECT 2: And little did we realize that while the band was playing, my father, he had eight brothers and sisters, all married. 

SUBJECT 1: --and children. 

SUBJECT 2: Some of them had eight, six, four, five children, around 40 cousins, all my aunts and uncles, and my father were killed that morning in the gas chamber. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you know it was them? 

SUBJECT 2: We Didn't realize it then. We only found out later, because no one ever seed them-- seen them. And then we found out what's going on. 

SUBJECT 1: --after two days. 

SUBJECT 2: But even then, they started to say what those chimneys are about. And even when the smoke of the burning human flesh was penetrating-- 

SUBJECT 1: I smelled-- 

SUBJECT 2: --in our noses. 

SUBJECT 1: And she said, such a big concentration, lots of people die. Because I smelled the burned smell and meat smell. She said, Ma, what do you expect? They should have here a cemetery? Lots of people die. They burn them. After two days, I-- I-- the-- the local Kapos there, who was-- 

SUBJECT 2: Kapos. 

SUBJECT 1: The kapos, they told us. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did they-- you said they're burning them. They didn't burn them alive, did they? 

SUBJECT 1: A little, yes. 

SUBJECT 2: Sometimes. 

SUBJECT 1: A little, yes, some. The children alive. Little children, just with one-- that child. 

SUBJECT 2: Sometimes I understand by then, as the Hungarian transports were arriving, they didn't even have time to burn every body or to gas before burn. So I understand they had piles of wood, a row of wood, a row of children, a row of wood, and a row of children. Then they poured some gasoline on it. 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

SUBJECT 2: And just set it to fire. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And they died, the children? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. They were burned alive. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you see this? 

SUBJECT 1: I said look at the black smoke. And the kapos, they told us. No place in the gas chamber, they burned them in the bushes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was this kapo? 

SUBJECT 2: They were the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: --that one that told you. 

SUBJECT 2: --Jewish leaders that were put in charge of us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah-- 

SUBJECT 2: Some of them-- 

SUBJECT 1: they was the Jews. 

SUBJECT 2: Some of them were there for years. Some of them were quite brutal, like-- but in retrospect-- not that I justify brutality under any circumstances. But sometimes, if they didn't get us do what we were supposed to do, they knew that the SS would come and make us do it the hard way. So, some of them were maybe overstepping. 

SUBJECT 1: But this Slovak was with years before in Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT 2: There were some people who were there for years and became quite brutal. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember the names of any of these people? 

SUBJECT 2: No. Oh, I know my first encounter was-- this was the first day we were standing naked in rows. And my mother didn't stand straight enough. So one of these kapos came over and hit her in the head. And I immediately jumped at her. You know, this was the first few hours. 

SUBJECT 1: The x-ray-- I still have them in my head. 

SUBJECT 2: And I-- she grabbed me. She says, you see those chimneys? You want to end up there? I didn't know what she means. But my mother realized it maybe, started to realize it, and begged me not to fight with her. And I think that's was my first lesson to know that, in this place, you can't win through fighting. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, we skipped something. The cattle car arrived at Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes, and-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: When? How? 

SUBJECT 2: Well, it was early in the morning. And-- 

SUBJECT 1: --was that. 

SUBJECT 2: And they told the men to go separate in rows of five, and women separate in rows of five. And as we arrived to the officer who was doing the selection-- I think it was Mengele. And me and my mother came up, and he sent one of us to the left, the other to the right. Although we didn't know still what's happening, we came back a few steps and met again in front of him. And we were holding onto each other. 

INTERVIEWER 2: One moment? 

SUBJECT 2: Always waiting. 

[AIRPLANE ENGINE ROARS] 

INTERVIEWER 2: The trouble with being out here-- 

SUBJECT 2: Perhaps we can put the bag on the floor. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --father separated from them when? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Tell us when there-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the last time you saw your father? 

INTERVIEWER 2: You all right? 

CREW: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Tell us when. Yes? 

SUBJECT 2: Laurel, will you please, just hold this. Thank you. 

CREW: Not yet. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Rolling? 

CREW: Not yet. 

CREW: He's changing tapes. 

SUBJECT 2: And they opened the doors. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Not yet, no, not yet. Is the wind sound all right? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your father was-- 

CREW: He's making one adjustment. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your father was with you there still. 

SUBJECT 2: Pardon me? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your father was still with you? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What about that? Is that all right, that wind blowing? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Anyone with you, wonder-- where were you? What was happening? How were the doors opened? What did you hear? What happened next? Father last time? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Rapidly-- that's what we don't get, everybody just assumes. People-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: We don't know anything. 

CREW: Rolling. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What? 

CREW: Rolling. 

INTERVIEWER 2: OK, go ahead. 

SUBJECT 2: We arrived very early in the dusk. It was still dark. And suddenly, the doors opened. And previous prisoners started to yell, "Out, out, out, fast out." And we had no idea where we are, had no idea what's coming. We just still tried to keep together, because that was always the most important part. But they said that men have to go in a separate line and women separate lines. 

So I still-- my last recollection of my father is to see the men lined up and us lined up. And I happened to somehow have a piece of salami with me. And my mother said that she has some also. I should give this to my father. 

So I ran over and gave it to him. And he didn't want to take it. He thought-- I said, we have some. You just take it. This was the last time I saw him. And, um, we were standing in rows of five. And as we approached, the officer was doing the selection, just with his finger-- right, left. 

He sent my mother to one side and me to another side. But We had no idea what it means. Somehow, instinctively, we came back and met in front of him. And my mother held onto me, and she said in German, Bitte lass mich bei meiner Tochter , which means, please, let me stay with my daughter. 

And he noticed how nice she speaks German. He says, how can you speak German? She says, well I went to German school. He said, well, get lost! But he didn't tell us to the right or to the left. And instinctively, we went to the side where it meant life. But we could have might as well go to the other side. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And then what happened? 

SUBJECT 2: Well, they took us to a big building. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who? 

SUBJECT 2: Yes? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who pulled whom to the side? 

SUBJECT 2: I really don't remember. We just both walked over. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Maybe your mother did. 

SUBJECT 2: Well, I think that my mother tells me now that she wanted to go where the young people were sent because somebody in the ghetto-- I understand an SS in the ghetto toward her-- that whenever a selection is taking place, she should go where young and capable people are sent. That means we'll be able to go work. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Were you carrying anything with you? Were you carrying anything? Did you have any belongings? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, we had lots of cookies we should have brought to eat. But they took it away. The glass-- I said, my glasses. You don't need glasses anymore. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This was a new member arriving in the train? 

SUBJECT 2: --to Auschwitz. 

SUBJECT 1: Sure. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Tell me everything from the beginning. The train is stopping. 

SUBJECT 1: The train was went three days. We haven't got a little water. It was so hot, never was so hot May like in that-- this was May the 13th. We went them 12 to 15. May the 15th we arrived to Auschwitz. 

People-- one woman was collapsed. And we-- we said, "Help! Help!" Nobody-- and that time I said to myself, oh, this I don't like it. When somebody collapses and he don't open our door, a little water-- it was three days out a little water. 

SUBJECT 2: We were so jammed there. And I think it was most humiliating for people who were so shy, people to begin with. You know, it was a very conservative, conventional group. And here you are, you have to eat whatever you have. You have eliminate right there standing next to each other. People getting sick, dying, some giving birth. I mean, this was a cargo of human beings. And life went on. The natural processes went on. And this was just a most dehumanizing experience to be so close to-- you know, within inches and all this to happen. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Were you looking out of the train? What could you see when you looked out? 

SUBJECT 1: We couldn't look. This was a little window like where we put the, now the cows or the horses. We couldn't look out from window. We haven't got window. This was high. 

SUBJECT 2: Some people, who were by the window, occasionally could look out. 

SUBJECT 1: We asked for water. We begged. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you feel sick? 

SUBJECT 1: No. No. 

SUBJECT 2: My mother always had a lot of courage and hope. And she was a fighter always. Although she was a very sick woman by the time we were going, she actually was doing better in the camps because she had so much fortitude and so much will to live that health-wise, in a way, she was stronger. 

SUBJECT 1: But I know, when I die, then she don't fight for a little eating like I fight. Ah, Ma, we don't live anyway. Why do you have to fight? But I fighter. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You didn't even feel unwell? You felt all right? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes, yes, yes. 

SUBJECT 2: My mother has a tremendous will to live. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What-- When you got off the train-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You arrive in Auschwitz. And-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: What happened? 

SUBJECT 2: So the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Moment-by-moment. 

SUBJECT 1: The boys come in in the train, the Jewish boys, the star. And they said, mother, leave the children. Leave the children. You mothers, leave the children. Because he knows, they go with the children. But who leaves a child? Well, which mother go down and leave the baby? 

INTERVIEWER 2: What did he know? He knew what? 

SUBJECT 1: We didn't know nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 2: No, what did you say he knew? 

SUBJECT 2: This was a former prisoner. 

SUBJECT 1: He knows. 

SUBJECT 2: He knew that if the mother is clinging to the child, she will be sent with the child to the gas. 

SUBJECT 1: She'll go with the child to the gas. 

SUBJECT 2: But if she would be willing to give up the child, she might be selected for working. 

SUBJECT 2: Sure, lots of-- thousands and thousands of mothers would be alive. 

SUBJECT 2: But they didn't want to give up their children. 

SUBJECT 1: Who'd give up two, three children and go out. 

SUBJECT 2: So they all went with their children. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did he try to help save lives? 

SUBJECT 2: These Jewish prisoners-- 

SUBJECT 1: The Jewish prisoners, yes, they tried, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And so what-- then what happened? 

SUBJECT 1: So we went on left side. And we were-- we went there. And they, they cut down our hairs, all of it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Well, well, you are still in the train. And you're getting off the train. 

SUBJECT 1: They took it-- nothing you can take with you. We have to-- to eat everything. We have to leave everything in the train, and just-- they cutted out our hair. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you walked off the train. 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What next, next moment? 

SUBJECT 1: No, we went in a-- in a place. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh, no. 

SUBJECT 2: The selection-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: --next moment. 

SUBJECT 2: The selection-- 

SUBJECT 1: Oh, when Mengele selection her. 

SUBJECT 2: When you-- we came down from the train, the we had-- 

SUBJECT 1: So, we went, and he was there. He looked at who was young person on the right side, who was older ones, with all the children on the left side. This was that. And I went to him. And I-- 

SUBJECT 2: We were separated. 

SUBJECT 1: Huh? 

SUBJECT 2: We were separated. 

SUBJECT 1: We were separated. And I look at her. She look at me. Ma-- and I went to him. I said to him, gentleman, please let's me to my daughter. He said, from where do you speak so good German? I said I have German schools. 

And he asked me how old I am. And that time I was 43. I don't know. Somebody told me. And I said 38. When I would say that was true, I would go on the left side. I said 38. Maybe my mother was there. And that's what we-- 

SUBJECT 2: She believes here mother told her. 

SUBJECT 1: We was kissing and crying because we are together. And then they took us out to cut off the hair and take out our clothing, everything. 

SUBJECT 2: After they cut off my hair-- 

SUBJECT 1: I did not recognize her. 

SUBJECT 2: We lost each other. And-- 

SUBJECT 1: We lost each other. 

SUBJECT 2: My mother didn't recognize me. I had long black hair. And suddenly you are shaved off. And she looks at me. And she called me by my brother's name. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: She thought it was my brother. 

SUBJECT 1: She looked like my son. So we-- 

SUBJECT 2: Because my hair was gone. 

SUBJECT 1: We hold each other. We should-- and I can go one for the other one. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You said they took away your glasses? 

SUBJECT 1: Everything, everything. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Weren't you very uncomfortable without-- 

SUBJECT 1: No, no. In that time I just wear-ed the glasses when I read. This wasn't so bad. But was girls, they had such glasses taken, she couldn't walk. But one, one woman who was there a long time, she bring it what 15, 20 glasses. And she looked at one, and she finded one for herself. 

But they took it away, the glasses from everybody. 

SUBJECT 2: Everybody-- we came out from the building just naked, even without our hair. And we given these striped dresses, and sometimes wooden shoes, sometime shoes that were selected from the wagons, from previous prisoners. Many times we didn't have a pair. They were different shoes. You were lucky if it fitted you. 

But we were very lucky that we didn't stay long in Auschwitz. An order came that they need laborers in Germany. So we were really sent out as slave labor to Hamburg. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Both of you? 

SUBJECT 2: Both of us, which was bombarded day and night. And we-- all these young women-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Now? They're changing tape. We don't-- your story is too good. Listen, Derek. 

CREW: Yes? 

INTERVIEWER 2: When we come back, we're going to need cutaways on this story. We can't edit this story without--
