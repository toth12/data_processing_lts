INTERVIEWER: --is to just reach back as far as you can go in your own mind to your family, your life, your friends, your-- your school. Anything you can remember about where-- where you came from and the town, et cetera. Uh, we want to ask very few questions. We would just like you to tell your story. Where you need a little something, we'll be there. But it's your story, and we prefer to have it just flow from you. OK, we're ready when you're ready. Do you want another white balance? 

CREW: No, I think I'm good. 

INTERVIEWER: OK. You rolling? OK. Mrs. Flashenberg, would you begin by telling us your name, where you came from, and describe your family? 

MRS. FLASHENBERG: I came from Krakow. And, too, I had a very big family. I have my first husband has got five brothers. And they all were finish university. They were-- one-- two were engineers, one was lawyer, and the other was in lawyer two-- two years. And one was in-- in Lemberg in the university. He gives historic. 

And when the German came after certain time, we didn't know what will be, so they want to put everybody out from Krakow. So my brother-- husband-- husband brothers, they doesn't want to go. So it came out, so then there was ordnungsdienst, you know, like Jewish police. 

But they didn't know that has to-- that's Gestapos. So when they find out what the purpose is, so everybody doesn't want to go and was sick to stay home. And so finally when they're all already finish and doesn't want to make-- to be in this together in with the police. 

So after certain time, it was my daughter's birthday party. She was two years old. And they all came, the whole family together. And came Gestapo and took them away. They're coming back just for a interview. And they never came back. And a certain time every month came. You forget this Herz attacks. Gestorben, this was a telegram to send the telegrams. But the people don't believe in this. We were already, no, that's to make-- they want to make trouble. But really-- then-- then came the-- came-- we came to ghetto. 

So one day this was the name of the ghetto-- of the street was Janovavola. And so the neighbors tell us, don't go out because they're killing every people. And after a few hours-- I was working this time in-- in the town, in Krakow. It was a Kommisarische Leitung. I was one of the cashiers, a few of them. And I want to go out. So I saw what's going-- it was the day, Kristallnacht. So I was so scared and I was crying. And come home, and my mother was saying-- I was with my mother-- what happened. 

I couldn't talk. I was like completely-- my nerves were-- I-- even now I can't-- when I remind myself. And then my mother, she was-- they put her on hospital, in the hospital because it was Aktion for old people. And she died over there. And-- and this time nobody-- I went alone to the cemetery and put her in a grave, because nobody was working. 

And finally I saw I have got a good man, the commissaire. He said, you know, I think you should-- and my daughter she was a very beautiful girl, extremely beautiful. That's whoever somebody see, they want to take a picture from here. So he said to me, you know, I don't want to make a scene. But maybe you go to some relative and so not stay in-- in Krakow, in ghetto. 

And really I-- I went to Plaszow. I was very short time, because I saw it's no good. Then I went to Czestochowa. I have got family over there. When I came in I find out that the Gestapo took them away, and there are not-- what happened nobody knows. And I was-- she was very little, Inga was her name. And I saw what they have to do. I want to kill myself, even to kill her too. Because I haven't got strength more to-- 

But then I find out you can go to work. I was-- how you call this-- to go to work to Germany, to Austria. So I haven't got a place to sleep, not to be. So I went to the railroad station with the child, and I sit on the bank until it was morning. And she slept on my lap. And I was very extremely tired, what will be more. And I couldn't-- I haven't got nobody to share my what to do that somebody can tell me do this. 

So the next night I said, no, I will not stay here. Because they will know me. Because this little one was very, you know, gold, blond locks. So I-- I couldn't be-- so I went to another railroad station. Finally I went to the-- how do I call-- Arbeitsamter, in Czestochowa. And they say, what do you want to do? They were-- there was something suspicious that I want to go to-- to work. 

So I said I have-- and this time I look very-- I was not so young-- how I look young, you know. So I said to him, I have a boyfriend. And this child is from him. And I want to be with him together. OK. So-- so they say all right. The next day I went. I have got very much troubles, because everybody was looking at [INAUDIBLE]. And so I went to-- Breitenlee, no. One was in Vienna. And so like Arbeitsam, they call. 

And I get my everything. But it was gentile papers I have got, not my name. And I don't know what I-- I forgot what I say over there when I came to another one. So they ask me, in Breitenlee. This was a 22nd Bezirk. 

So they ask me, maybe you were in Vienna with a child with a woman like you. You weren't over there? So I said, no. I didn't. But I don't know. Maybe they want to help. Because I was suspicious of them. And finally, you want to go to a farm. So I said, yes. So I went to the farm. And this woman say, there were pigs. You have to feed them. And then she gives me about 50 pounds of flour to make bread. 

I haven't got-- I never cooked in my life. And she saw that's going. So she threw out me. No can use you. So at this time-- I stay again without what I will do here. So finally one which was working over there, she said, you know they're looking for somebody in the gardener house. It's not a-- it's not a woman over there. There are only two brothers. Go away. Maybe they will take you. And I went there and I told them I am somebody called-- told me to come. And they took me. 

And there were soldiers working too. You know, the prisoners. And I have to cook for the brothers and to make the garden-- in the garden. And so, I say I survived. But anyway, there were many, many stories. But I couldn't even-- it's one. I-- I want to in the concentration camp. Because it was very, very hard to-- every minute you can, and especially with a child. So it was very, very-- so I want to even to be in a kellar-- in a cellar I mean, and not to see people, what they have to ask, you know. Because of this child. 

And she was very scared, very scared. Well, that's-- yeah, there were hundreds of things. But I don't really-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Where you when the liberation came? Who were you with? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: I was in Vienna, no, Breitenlee. This is like 22nd Bezirk. Vienna, you know. And I went home. But I find-- no. And I find an uncle and an aunt. And when I came, and they were sure that I am not alive. Because-- so everybody was on the floor, almost unconscious that I came. If it's true, if it's dream. This is you, a are? 

That's-- there are many things I could say here, and days and days to tell. But I-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You had-- you never did go to a concentration camp? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Excuse me? 

INTERVIEWER 1: You never did go to a concentration-- 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Oh, I was in Plaszow. Plaszow was-- but I just was a few days, and then I run away, because until the-- you know, all of a sudden, you have to-- when you went to stay over there in ghetto, you have to get blue cards. Blue cards I got from somebody. Because my husband and my whole family, you know, my father from my husband was an engineer on the railroads. He has got three stars. They're very influential people. 

And so they want to make me this piece of blue card that I could stay. All of a sudden there has to be a stamp on this. And I couldn't get this. So again, I was-- it was-- million and sick of rules, what they want to-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Could you just walk out of the Krakow ghetto when you-- you were in the Krakow ghetto, yes? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Could you just walk out? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: You know, I was working in a transportation office. The name was transport. And there was a German man, the name was Miller. And finally this time I was working, because this was my uncle's firm. And he said to me, you-- you want to stay here. Because-- but this will be not only one firm, just will be a few firms. When you will be able to do this, you can stay here. 

So I said, I don't know. I will try. So finally I got this, I could do. So he keeps me until a certain time that I can go to the ghetto and took him. But my child, no. So she has to stay over there. And there was every-- every week they make Aktion for the children. You know, they killed the children. So he said to me, listen, when you have relatives not in Krakow, go away from here. 

Even he offers me this time if I-- of course we haven't got anything. They took my apartment and they took everything. But this was not-- not important. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The child? She survived with you? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: She survived. She survives, but you know, she is depressed very often, you know, very often depressed. And she remembers-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old is she now? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Now she's 39. She married. She has two children. She's divorced. And she was a very smart girl. She went to college and-- but, it's-- on the young population, it's really they are-- a child has to be a happy child. She never was happy, you know. She went-- every time she ask me, where is my daddy. And I didn't want to tell her. Say, he's coming. And he used to go. He was working on hangars. 

You know, he was an engineer from airplanes. So she said to me, yes. I said he's coming the next train. Is the next train when he-- whatever. She was a smart girl at this time at two years. But--

INTERVIEWER 2: Eheschein? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Eheschein. That means, you now, when somebody came. I don't really know. Because when my daughter married, my uncle brought me this. I should show it to them, to the parents of-- so they say to me, they were from Israel. Ah, who needs this? Today is money, not the eheschein. You know when somebody belonged to-- like society, you know. But this was--

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: During the birthday, came the Gestapo, and took them all. But we were not-- we didn't know what will be. We thought them maybe. But you know, because they were in the-- they took this time plenty. You know, every-- but from the intell-- you know, from the intelligent-- only the, you know, engineers, lawyers, doctors. And they kill everyone. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How do you they killed them?

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: They sent a telegram, I told you, in forged this heart attack gestorben. There everybody gets a telegram. This was they put the-- it was a criminal in Krakow. The name was Montelupich. And from Montelupich, they took him to-- to Auschwitz. And the-- all telegrams, they were for Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said at one point that you wished you were in a camp. You wanted to go to a camp. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. Because every moment, whatever you move, and you were in danger. Every moment, you know, because so-- you were with people together, whatever I have. And every minute you can-- let's say it was such a moment in Czestochowa, there was-- no, this was in [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] When I came to [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] it was an Aktion. It was a nice man, you know. So this time when you go to cemetery-- I don't know, what's the name? When I'm nervous my English is very bad. You know, I can't-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: If you say it in Yiddish, I'll try-- 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: No, you see in Polish, I could tell you. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Say it in Polish. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] When the-- you know, when you-- you go to cemeteries on this day, particular day. I think it's in November, 6 November. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Like a Memorial Day? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Like Memorial Day. You go to cemetery. So this man, because I was-- I was very afraid to go to the railroad station. So I have got a black veil on and with a child, and everything in black. And I went like this, so nobody bothers me. When I came over there, I saw the whole [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] is burned, the ghetto. This day I will never forget. Everything was in flames. They burned the whole ghetto. 

This was-- which year can this be? I don't really remember which year it could be. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You were walking on the road, is that right? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: No. I was-- I was in a-- I went through. When I went out from the railroad, I went through. Because I want to go in ghetto, you know? And there was fire. So this time and now I remember-- I couldn't stay over there. So that's what I say. It was very bad to be maybe when you have to be very shrewd-- and very-- you know, every moment, every single moment was in danger. 

INTERVIEWER 2: There was a lot of tension for you all the time. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: A lot tension, a lot of tension. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you were hiding with your child, or trying to just stay alive with your child, did you try to teach her anything? Did you try to give her some sense of who she was? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: No, you see, she was already so hard. I remember when I was in Breitenlee, and they bombed-- put down bombs, she was not afraid. I say, come to the cellar. Come to-- No, I'm not afraid. I don't care what are being-- no. She was not afraid. She was-- I don't want-- they kill me, so they kill me. 

INTERVIEWER 2: When you were-- 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: It was very hard, let's say. I don't remember where we were in-- at one town. And she said, mother, I want to eat something, flaki. That's a Polish thing. So I said, Inga. This was before the war, I mean when the war already was then. So I said, Inga, I'm so scared, I am to go. So she said, I will tell you. You are on arisch paper, when you don't give me the Flaki. 

So I want to. I want to eat something good. I want to eat something. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So she made it very hard for you. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Very hard. She was a very spoiled child. You know, the only one. So everybody spoiled her and everybody, because she was so beautiful, so every-- a spoiled child. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old was she during this period? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Since she was two years old. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you try to teach her about being Jewish or did you tell her she wasn't Jewish? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Oh, she alone. You know, after the way, when we came, I was-- my name was [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] And she was on the same name. So she said, mother. I want to finish with this. I want to be Jew. I want Freundlich. And I don't want to go to such a school when I cannot be by myself and Jewish. I want to be. I said because I don't want to. I was scared they will kill her. So I want to give her to-- 

So she doesn't want. So she went to another school. And she wants to be Jewish. And finally she wants-- she wants to go to Israel, not to America. And she was so strong, such a good Jewish girl. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you keep her from telling people she was Jewish when you were hiding? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: She doesn't know she was Jewish. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh, she didn't know then. That's what I asked. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: She doesn't know what she's Jewish. But later she knows her name was different. 

CREW: Mrs. Weiss? Do you know where she is? One of your people that's working up here. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You have to go back there. We're recording. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This room is closed. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sorry. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I want to continue if you will, talking about your life in Krakow before the war started. And what made you first realize that something very terrible was going to happen. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: No, I didn't know. You know, I didn't know even this was in '39-- '39-40. And I was with a little-- '40. Yes, I was with-- with-- wagon, with the-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Carriage. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Carriage. And they blew out a bomb. So I said, I ask, what is this. So he said, because I came this time from summer vacation. So he said, no. They're trying. We don't never know. And she doesn't know if she's Jewish. If there is nobody-- what? If you can tell a child what is two year, what she is? No. 

But later, alone, I didn't-- then she knows. Of course, I told her later when she was older that our name is-- she knows what was our name. And what is now this name. But she was very confused. You couldn't talk to her so much about it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you, when did you realize that bad things were going to happen to Jews? When did you know? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: I didn't know. I didn't believe. I didn't believe, you know. Because we have got this time-- I later saw what can-- they were reported, because he was working a lot building in not Jewish only. So I trust in people. I give them everything in my possession to keep them. And I never got back this, what we have got, you know, jewelry, purse, and so on. Because I didn't-- I just one day remember, when it was so bad and I ask my friend, Polish friend, if I can be-- but I was already alone with my child be the night. So he said, of course. But his wife say, no. What are you doing? You have children too. 

You have to care about you children. I-- I love Sidonia very much. But I don't want my children-- and she start-- and I went to go away. So he said, no, you stay here. I will not let you go. It's 12 o'clock in the night. Because you will-- you will be finished. So and they were screaming at each other, you know. And I pray to God it should be 7 o'clock. I should go out from of this house. 

So there are many, many things like this. But this we will never survive because ghetto was already-- it was a terrible night. They kill all-- all children. You know what happened? My sister-in-law, so she went through the canals-- the-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sewers. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. Through the canals with a child. And they catch her. They killed, in this place, her and this child. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So your friend was asking you to stay with them because he was afraid for you in the ghetto? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yes. No, I introduced them, you know, the marriage. He married this woman through me, you know. So he has got some obligation. He was very, very good. And she was screaming, what you're doing. My children are nothing you know, and so on. 

INTERVIEWER 2: This is when you were running away from Krakow? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yes. I have, you know, after all everybody knows you. It was very hard. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You were worried about being recognized. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. I'm just that now they will feel in Poland what we've been through. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you wearing a yellow star? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yes. But very often a woman came to me, why do you need this? Take this out. Who will believe that you are that? So I said, no. My friends, my brothers, everybody was wearing. 

INTERVIEWER 2: When did you take it off? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: When I got the papers. When I saw it's very hard to-- you couldn't get in ghetto with a child. It was impossible. So immediately they will kill the child. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you sneak her out of the ghetto? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Excuse me? 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you sneak your daughter out of the ghetto? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: No, I was working, you know, and I have got the opportunity to go every day in the morning and took him in the night. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Out? To go out? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So how did-- 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: But one night I remember, when they brought my Inga, my child. Because it has to be Aktion, an Aktion over there. So we were sitting in-- because I have got the cash. And all of sudden, they came in. And I didn't hear the rubber-- rubber shoes. And so, I say we were working for the-- how you call this Polish-- you know, they want only money, for the underground, you know, underground. 

And they took everything, the money. And-- and one holds a gun, one side, another on the other side. And my Inga was looking and say, I don't have anymore daddy. Don't kill me my mother. And she starts to cry terrible. 

So he said to her, don't cry. When you cry we will kill your mother. When you be quiet, we will not do anything to her. So she only [PANTS]. You know, like this I remember. And they took the money. so I have to call the man what was in charge, Mr. Miller, I remember. So and so is happened. They took all my money. And so he said, I'm sorry. But the Gestapo has to come. 

So here came the Gestapo, what happened. Because you know, they took all telephones. I have to go to another telephone and find to tell him what happened. I couldn't run away. So the Gestapo came. And I put my daughter in the superintendent. They should keep her. And I give her the ring, whatever I have got, she should keep it a few hours until Gestapo comes. 

And so the Gestapo came, and said, it's 1 o'clock in the night. What you are doing here? So I said, I couldn't find to make the total and the cash line. And they were all different. So I stay until like find the error. So no, they didn't do anything to me. And so they went. But they made all investigation and then now I remember. Until this happened, I have to go. Because every minute where I move, I have got somebody on there. Because they didn't believe what can-- they want to-- to run after me to see what-- what really happened, if I was not involved with them. 

So it's many, many, many, many stories. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So you were followed by the Gestapo? Is that right? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: I was followed every day. They want to see where I am going, who keep, with whom I am talking or so. So I figured out it's impossible to be over there. So that was the-- concentration, how I came, was that-- what I went to Plaszow to find out how it will be impossible, you know, to say. But with the child it was impossible. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long were you hiding with your daughter, four years, five years? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: It would have been about four years, yes. Four years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And during that time was a very important time for her. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Yes, that's what I have learned now. She was very-- she married good and so. And she was very unhappy with him. I don't know. And she has the most wonderful children that I ever-- and the one-- this is what-- what makes me happy about our generation. The one is she hasn't got not so good life because of broken marriage. So she makes summa cum laude. And she has got scholarship through-- the other one too-- very-- when somebody really, we can be proud that we have so our generation very, very smart. 

They told even, their mother told them this story, what she went-- and one is she took the journalistic-- she-- she has-- she has to write. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you do with your daughter all the time that you were hiding. Four years is a long time. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Oh, and how. Very, very, very, very hard. I didn't know-- you know, I am very bad sleeper. I can't sleep. And I-- I'm going through most of the time when I cannot sleep, the whole story with the-- it's coming back. That's what I say. To supervise a child this time was hardest thing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What are some of the things that you remember about that time with your little girl, some of the stories? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: So-- there were so many stories. She was-- you know, she was sick. I couldn't go to a doctor. Because I was afraid. All of a sudden she got, you know, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] the whole body. And I couldn't go with her to a doctor, because I be afraid what-- what the doctor will say, from where are what. So I take a needle, and put in them, and everything by myself. I was doing to her. You know, she has until today, you know, I had feet, one after another. 

So you know, when you have such a cronker-- I know how you call it-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Boils. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Abscess. Abscess, a big abscess. So this is very, very painful. So I want to make her easy. So I took a needle, and I take the-- how you call-- the puss out. And so it's-- when you are not doing this profession, it doesn't bring-- that's later you have the-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Scars. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: A scar, you know. Until today she has. Many things, you know, a child is sick and so. And there weren't no vitamin. nothing, not even bread, you know. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was it a struggle for you to get food for yourself? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: Very hard. Because I was scared to go to a store. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How would you do it? How would you go about it? 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: When I was working, so I have got. But later on the money was, you know. And it was very, very hard. I sell whatever I have got myself, a coat, and shoes, and everything I sold. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you try to teach your little girl how to read or-- 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: You know, when she was two years old, her father used to say, look, this is B. This is C. And she came over to him. This is this. She was very capable. And so she started, but no. She-- she knows how to read by herself. She was about-- she never went to school. She went to school already in America-- in-- after the war, but short time, when she wants to only be on her paper, not on the [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] Just on-- So she said, so it was very dangerous. The Poles were-- they kill-- they were killing. Very big anti-Semitism this time was.

MR. FLESCHENBERG: I was there three weeks in misery. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: He said, you came here for cure. So why do you want to go away? But it was very bad, you know, since today, I will tell you a story that doesn't belong here. One of the granddaughter, went to-- she went to London. She's supposed to be an exchange student. She met a German boy. And sort of in the conversation, and so finally I don't know if he fell in love. Because or something-- they write, very intelligent boy. And they have write-- correspond-- they correspond during the year. 

One year, once he said, you know, I love to meet to come to United States, to meet-- to see you again. I can stay here. And he really came and he said, you know, I am ashamed to say that I am a German, with what went through. And my daughter told her, you know, I don't care if he's gentile. But I care that he's German. He could kill you father, his father could kill your father. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Your grandfather. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: And do you know what's this means? So I don't know what happened. He was very, very intelligent. He feels very bad. So she told him this story, you know. My mother told me this and this, you know. So he said, but you see what I can do. I am ashamed to be a German. So but-- so my daughter, let him be a gentile. I don't care if you marry a gentile. But I care if-- I am afraid about Germans. 

His father that, she said, is a very intelligent man. And so he's a lawyer. But he can be a killer to your father. So-- So it means, you know, what's the generation now, how-- how they feel. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said that there were SS men in this place where you were for a cure. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: No. There were men, they came to cure too. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. I saw a man. And I couldn't talk to him. Because I was afraid. I'm in Germany. But I think he was in one of my concentration camps. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why were you afraid? 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Because I was there, in their court. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: And there are millions of-- and thousands of times when we are alone. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Who knows? He can take a gun and kill me, because I know him. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: So it was already. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. [? [INAUDIBLE] 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: When he will be here, he will be not afraid. But when he was with them. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah, when I know him here, I would-- I would go and I would tell the police to arrest him. That he was an SS man there. And there I saw this and this. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: It was a terrible thing to go anyway to Germany. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: Yeah. I didn't want to go anymore there. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: But he got this, you know, he got this because he was sick. So the German give them to cure. But we don't want anymore. Because we have got a very bad time this. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Have you ever gone back to Poland?

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: I went twice. I went with her to leave her. And then I went to take her back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ever go back to Germany? 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: No. I don't want to go to Germany. I don't like to see them. And I don't want to hear from them. Because I got a very bad experience from them. You know what? In-- in the last concentration camp, there was such a Nazi, an Austrian Nazi, a man, maybe 60 years old. So he told me once like this. When we will lose the war, we will kill all the Jews first. But we were-- we were liberated from the American Army. So I says, you better watch yourself. Maybe somebody will kill you now. He was red. I'm sorry I told this. I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't tell you. I will not kill you. Don't worry. But I'm telling you, you will find a man who will kill you sometimes. For this, you were talking like this. Such terrible Nazis over there in Austria too. And some people were good soldiers. 

MRS. FLESCHENBERG: But you see now we have the Ku Klux Klan anyway. 

MR. FLESCHENBERG: A 65-year-old soldier, he you used to bring me sometimes two pieces of bread with butter. And old man, he likes me. I spoke very nice German. I finished in Austrian schools at the time from Austria.
