INTERVIEWER: Where? 

SUBJECT 1: In Poland. 

INTERVIEWER: Go ahead. 

SUBJECT 2: Tell where you live. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. Then I was 19 years, I came to Vienna to study there. And somehow I didn't have too much money, so I had to go to work. So I gave up the studying. And in 1937, I got married. 

SUBJECT 2: 1931. 

SUBJECT 1: '31, excuse me. '37 he was born. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. We met in 1930. My name is Gina Koral. I'm born in Vienna, Austria. In 1909 I'm born. Uh, I met my husband, and we got married in 1931 and lived very happy. And we had a lovely family life. I have four sisters and brothers, and we were a very close family. 

We had also non-Jewish friends. We used to go to the theaters and to broadway show-- to shows. And every holiday we were together. And everything was fine, and we were happy. And my husband opened a business for textile, and I worked with him along in that business until 1937 when my son was born. 

When my-- before my son was born, I went to school to learn how to take care of a baby. And there, already, people with whom I went, all the other women, we decided, oh, my god, maybe we shouldn't have any children, because we heard from Germany what they do. And we knew it's only months that Hitler will come in. 

Of course, the Vienna people thought he never will come into Germany-- to Vienna. But he did come in. So in 1937 he was born. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you discuss it whether to have a child or not have a child? 

SUBJECT 1: Naturally, we discussed it. 

SUBJECT 2: We discussed it, but then there was still-- 

SUBJECT 1: In the beginning, we didn't want to have a child because we wanted to enjoy life. 

SUBJECT 2: Years ago, it was like this, first you enjoy life. Later you have the children. But 1937, when he was born, so nine months before I was pregnant, that was still not a bad time. But after 1937, we decided-- 

SUBJECT 1: You know the family and the parents start to-- 

SUBJECT 2: My parents-- 

SUBJECT 1: --how long will you wait to have a child? 

SUBJECT 2: We were five years married already. 

SUBJECT 1: There was a rumor they can't have children, et cetera, et cetera. So finally we decided to have-- 

SUBJECT 2: --a child. And-- 

INTERVIEWER: But there was some question whether because of what's happening-- 

SUBJECT 2: And he was born with some questions. Maybe it was-- 

SUBJECT 1: It was already, you know, a situation with Germany. We expected Germany will come in because we had already the SR in Austria, they were pretty powerful. So we were afraid one day it will come. But we didn't-- I had a cousin in Bochum in Germany. And I called him up on the telephone, I am afraid. 

He said, don't worry about it. He was living in Bochum under Hitler. You know, in the beginning till '35 or '36, they didn't do anything to the Jewish people. 

SUBJECT 2: No too much. 

SUBJECT 1: So you don't have to be afraid. So I was a little bit-- 

SUBJECT 2: --quiet down. 

SUBJECT 1: --yeah, quiet down a little bit. But it was wrong. They took him too. 

INTERVIEWER: What was pleasant-- what was life in Vienna like? 

SUBJECT 1: Terrific. Terrific.

SUBJECT 2: We also had friends non-Jewish. But when Hitler came in, they did not want to know us. They just were afraid to talk to us. And they make believe that they don't know us. And one evening, we all came together in my father's house. 

INTERVIEWER: When? 

SUBJECT 2: In, uh, well, 1939, the beginning of-- 

SUBJECT 1: --'38.

SUBJECT 1: We had a beautiful apartment-- 

INTERVIEWER: Were there political discussions?

INTERVIEWER: Were there political discussions? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes, because you had to-- we had Schuschnigg before we had a priest-- a priest. What's his name? A priest, a bundeskanzler counselor, so it was anti-Semitic already in this. It wasn't-- but still it was a nice-- a nice town, city, Vienna. 

SUBJECT 2: I had a lovely life. My father was very well-to-do. He had a big business. And we were four girls and one boy. And we were dancing. And I had my father and the store before I was married, and I had lots of friends. And it was very nice until Hitler came in. 

One night, we were sitting and watching the radio. And they announced Schuschnigg-- 

SUBJECT 1: --resigned.

SUBJECT 1: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. And we were all-- once we looked out the window and, all of a sudden, one, with a-- he pointed to us. Go away from the window otherwise I shoot-- I shoot you. And so we got so afraid, we closed the doors, and we turned off the lights. And started to talk that we can't live here anymore. And-- 

INTERVIEWER: What happened on the streets on the day of the Einmarsch? What else? 

SUBJECT 2: The singing and dancing and-- 

SUBJECT 1: Singing and dancing and the population too. 

SUBJECT 2: And they said-- 

SUBJECT 1: The Austrian people also were dancing. 

SUBJECT 2: They all loved it, and they're just thrilled. They all dance in the street and they said, heil Hitler. And that's what we saw through the window. And then--

INTERVIEWER: What? 

SUBJECT 1: I told you, I saw-- near our house was a school. And it was a public school, mixed Jewish and Gentile. And the children came on the streets. Before the children, let's say, had to go home, they would start to holler, Blut wird spritzen, leg, all the Jews should go to Lenin. Not Len- What was the House Minster, Jewish-- 

SUBJECT 2: I don't remember.

SUBJECT 2: And then they started-- 

SUBJECT 1: Then they started-- 

SUBJECT 2: --the stores write down, not to go in because it's a Jewish store. They made signs in the windows. 

SUBJECT 1: Juden und Hunden 

SUBJECT 2: Juden und Hunden 

SUBJECT 1: Eintritt verboten. That was every store you could go. 

INTERVIEWER: Was your store? 

SUBJECT 1: Huh? 

SUBJECT 2: No, we didn't-- 

SUBJECT 1: Jewish stores they closed right away. They put the biggest store they took in Reichsverwaltung, you know. 

SUBJECT 2: And so the stores were closed. And everybody was thinking to get out. 

INTERVIEWER: Was your store closed? 

SUBJECT 2: Our store was closed before already, because my husband decided to close the store and work for my father. 

So he worked for my father and then my father gave up this business. And he knew too he has to leave. But he wanted first the children to leave. That was most important for him. 

So one night we all left and went to Swedish smuggler. Only my sister-- one sister-- 

INTERVIEWER: You were picked up. There were other things. 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, this was before. Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. One night. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. One night I was picked up from the gestapo, as they called, from the police. 

SUBJECT 2: SS. 

SUBJECT 1: They came in. No. No. First, you see an SR came in my apartment. And he said, look, I need the apartment. You have to leave right away the apartment. 

So I said, look, I don't have any-- look, what do you? You have a choice, to go to Dachau or you give up right away the apartment. So naturally, I had to leave everything left there. And I moved into-- 

SUBJECT 2: To my father's apartment. 

SUBJECT 1: Her father's apartment. 

And one night he picked me up, myself. They picked me up and took me to the police station. Then I was staying overnight. And that morning-- 

SUBJECT 2: Now in the morning. 

SUBJECT 1: Had to go in the cellar to carry up-- 

SUBJECT 2: Heavy packages. 

SUBJECT 1: 100 pound packages. 

And-- 

SUBJECT 2: After two days-- 

SUBJECT 1: No. No. And, you see-- and before I had to go in a room where an SR man was there. I have to knock in to report to him. 

Soon I knocked on the door. And not too hard. So he said, I didn't hear. He gave me right away, you know, he hit me right away. 

The next day the same. I came and I knocked a little bit harder. You knocked too hard. He started to beat me to like, you know, a whip and hit me. 

So after two days the police, they brought trucks, and they-- ya. In the evenings we had to go in the yard, and we had to exercise. Exercise. 

He told us, you know what a pig is? I said, yes. You have to do with your nose. You see in the ground, you have to do to make a hole with my nose. 

INTERVIEWER: Like a pig? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. And there was a religious guy with a beard. And they had a barrel. They put it in the barrel. And they closed it. And we had to roll him. 

So then they took us-- they took me to a school. 

INTERVIEWER: Now, you had to like-- do-- clean something with your nose? 

SUBJECT 1: With the nose. 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe that exactly? 

SUBJECT 1: You-- I had to lay down on the floor. 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: And he said me, the nose, you have to make a hole. 

INTERVIEWER: In the stone? 

SUBJECT 1: It's not a stone. This was a yard. 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. It is a country. 

SUBJECT 2: Country. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you? 

SUBJECT 1: I had to do it, you see. 

Then after an hour meanwhile they used to beat us up in all kinds of ways. 

So finally, in the morning, early in the morning-- so it was still around 12 o'clock at night. And they-- we had to stay overnight in the room. And early in the morning they pick me up. They picked all us up. And they took us to a school, maybe thousands or 2,000 people. It was [INAUDIBLE]. And one-- it's one or another, we didn't have-- we couldn't breathe. 

And in the morning we had to report. It was a step. We had to jump the step. If somebody did missed the one step, he stood the SA with the-- with the cane, you know, as they call it, and hit us. 

And then they start to investigate everybody. I thought they-- I don't know. I got scared. So I'm just hoping you know what we SR went through before we came to power? 

So I had a few things, a ring, and this, and a watch. You have to give up the ring. 

Then in the morning-- then later they made lines, left and the right line. This line goes this way. This line that. I was lucky. I was in the line. He said, OK, you can go home. But you have to report to us. 

And they said, look, you have to leave the country. [INAUDIBLE] 

INTERVIEWER: Did you expect your husband to come back? 

SUBJECT 2: I was very, very worried. And I went to that school. And there were small children standing. And they behaved terrible. They wanted to hit everybody. 

And-- but we were very lucky because somehow he came out. Not everybody. And-- 

SUBJECT 1: And I-- 80% didn't come out. I was lucky. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

And when he came home, that's when we decided then that we want to leave, because we cannot go through things like this.

SUBJECT 1: He couldn't take it. He took his life. 

SUBJECT 2: At night he took his life. He and his wife, he just couldn't take it. He was born there. And all of a sudden, he had to do things. He had to clean the streets with his hands. 

SUBJECT 1: With their hand-- with their hands. 

SUBJECT 2: His nose. 

SUBJECT 1: They didn't give us brooms or something. With your hands you had to do it. So-- 

SUBJECT 2: They watched. 

SUBJECT 1: We had swollen red hands for hours. 

INTERVIEWER: How many-- 

SUBJECT 2: Whoever was in the street. 

INTERVIEWER: --Jews were doing that at one time?

SUBJECT 2: Du musst es beschreiben.

SUBJECT 2: Hit you. 

SUBJECT 1: Hit us. 

INTERVIEWER: And for how many hours did this go on? 

SUBJECT 1: This was five, six hours. One day. This was only one day. And we were hiding. And I was hiding. You remember? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: You remember what? 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. I remember one night somebody told us that this night they're going to take all the men, take them to concentration camp. So we decided we had a friend who had a factory already closed. But he had a roof. 

SUBJECT 1: A roof. 

SUBJECT 2: And we took my husband, and my father, and my brother in law. They all went there. And they're hiding in the roof. 

SUBJECT 1: By a chimney. [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 2: One night. 

And the next night I came back, and nothing happened to them. 

So that's how we were hiding out until we could leave. And then they had no visa and nothing to go to. The American console said you were born in Poland. You have to wait until your number is coming. 

So we decided a cousin of ours left two, three weeks before. And he went to Belgium. And he had the smartness to send us. 

And we came to Cologne. And we waited. First of all, we went with the small children. My son was two years old. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: He couldn't walk. 

INTERVIEWER: How did you leave Vienna, the three of you? 

SUBJECT 2: It was a very sad moment. My father had all his children in his house. And one night we all left. We cried bitterly. 

And we came on a train. 

INTERVIEWER: And you-- 

SUBJECT 2: And we couldn't take anything along. 

And we were traveling a whole night from Vienna until we came to Cologne. And there somebody told us we were very-- 

SUBJECT 1: And the train they were already saying, Blut wird schwinden, erwischen Juden, you know. 

SUBJECT 2: I killed them. 

SUBJECT 1: I killed them right away. 

SUBJECT 2: So when we came to Cologne-- 

INTERVIEWER: And you said goodbye to your-- 

SUBJECT 2: We cried bitterly. And my father and mother just felt they want the children out to be saved. And whatever it's going to be with them, they're not so young anymore, they didn't care. 

And we came to Cologne. 

INTERVIEWER: What happened-- what happened to them? 

SUBJECT 2: My parents were very lucky. I had a sister who left Israel-- who left from Vienna to Israel. And she had a chance to send a parents certificate card. 

So my parents left later. First they wanted to see the children, good. So we came to Belgium in Cologne. And there we had a small hotel. And we waited quite a few days. 

And Cologne there was quite a few stores where they said, Juden nicht erlaubt. So we couldn't go in for food. But somehow we managed. 

And one night there came a smuggler. And he says he sent, and we should go with him. So we went with him, and he took us to that truck. And that's the story that my husband-- 

SUBJECT 1: Now, I will tell my-- 

INTERVIEWER: Tell me. Was it the three of you? 

SUBJECT 1: --from Poland. I had four brothers and one sister. And six gran-- nephews. They were all killed. 

My sister was-- they buried her alive. She was-- and my niece was killed on the street walking. My parents too. 

[SNIFFLING] 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

And so when we came to Cologne, and the smuggler said OK. We are going there and there. He took us. We were two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight people I think we got. 

And so he says at all the children cannot go, because they'll now scream, and then they're lost. So he gave the children-- we had another child. My sister's child was five months old. And Kurt was-- 1927. He was two years old. He couldn't even walk yet. We had to carry him. 

So we-- he says, they have to go with the man. And that one smuggler was running through the woods with the children, and my husband and the other man. And my sister and me with two or three other women, we were in a truck which had a double wall. 

INTERVIEWER: I think we are-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. Yeah. We [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. 

So before Hitler came into Belgium. 

INTERVIEWER: No. No. We are still-- 

SUBJECT 2: We're still-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: It's still different. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: The-- a smuggler came to pick you up from the hotel. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

We had to give him a certain amount of money, you see, in order to-- 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: So-- 

INTERVIEWER: Of course, you will not get to the border. 

SUBJECT 1: On the border--

SUBJECT 2: A toll house. 

SUBJECT 1: A toll station. You see, a police station. 

I don't know. We were around 40 people there. You know. 40 or 30 peoples. 

SUBJECT 2: I don't know. Maybe less. 

SUBJECT 1: I didn't see, they caught us. They took us in. 

SUBJECT 2: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 1: To the police station. 

INTERVIEWER: You planned to cross the border? 

SUBJECT 1: We planned to cross the border. 

INTERVIEWER: And-- 

SUBJECT 1: Because we arranged with them. They talk-- you have to-- this is the situation. You have to stay. Come to this point. 

But meanwhile, they caught us. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. 

And so the gestapo-- 

SUBJECT 1: The gestapo-- 

INTERVIEWER: Stop-- 

SUBJECT 1: They stopped us, and they took us to the station there, to their station. First they took everything. 

INTERVIEWER: The smuggler was with you or not? 

SUBJECT 1: No. The smuggler was-- he-- 

SUBJECT 2: He did his job. 

SUBJECT 1: We had to come. See he did his job. He told us in Cologne you have to go in Germany till the border. He told us the way how we should go, and to the border. And they will expect us there and take us over the border. 

INTERVIEWER: They is who? 

SUBJECT 1: From the smugglers. 

SUBJECT 2: They had other ones waiting there. 

SUBJECT 1: It was a whole organization. 

INTERVIEWER: But when you arrived at the border, it was instead gestapo, not-- 

SUBJECT 1: It was gestapo. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. 

SUBJECT 1: And then the gestapo, we had to give up everything. And they start to-- 

SUBJECT 2: To question us. 

SUBJECT 1: To question us about it. First they took everything away from us. 

You know, I think everything. We did-- we didn't-- 

SUBJECT 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT 1: We were supposed to get 10 marks, but we didn't get it either. They took everything. 

SUBJECT 2: But they were involved with the smugglers. They know. 

INTERVIEWER: Then what happened? 

SUBJECT 1: So they started to-- to question everybody. But everybody was afraid because they told me, you should never mention the name. We knew the name from the-- from the-- 

SUBJECT 2: Smuggler. 

SUBJECT 1: Head of the-- 

SUBJECT 2: Smuggler. 

SUBJECT 1: Smuggler. So-- So I was afraid to tell him. 

But he took me, and, as I said, you are bowl headed. You are the smartest here. Come tell me the truth. Because if you don't tell me, we send-- 

SUBJECT 2: You back. 

SUBJECT 1: You all to Dachau. You have a chance. What's the name? 

So I figured I don't have any choice. So I told him. He said that's good. So you stay out till it's dark. 

SUBJECT 2: Late at night. 

SUBJECT 1: We took you-- we take you to the destination. And then your smuggler will be on the other side. 

INTERVIEWER: So this gestapo man was working with--

INTERVIEWER: What you told me before-- 

SUBJECT 2: He's finished. 

INTERVIEWER: Is not? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: Later when they came-- 

INTERVIEWER: --to me again. Everything. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: It was waiting-- the car. 

SUBJECT 1: It was a few cars waiting there. And they took us to Antwerp. 

SUBJECT 2: On the way, when they set in Belgium, I said, I'm the happiest woman in the world. I'm free. 

And we were so lucky. Even so we had no money. 

SUBJECT 1: In Antwerp you had to-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

INTERVIEWER: --in Antwerp. And either was-- the women were separated? 

SUBJECT 2: No. That was before. As soon as we came to Belgium, we were together. 

INTERVIEWER: In the house? 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

And then they came together. We came together there. And there was the cars waiting for us. And they waited until the men came with the children. And they all got in. And that's how he went to Antwerp. 

SUBJECT 1: If you had to run during this time with-- 

SUBJECT 2: This was before. 

SUBJECT 1: --the women-- and I told you [INAUDIBLE]. 

SUBJECT 2: We were in the truck. 

SUBJECT 1: They were-- they were in the truck, and I had to walk, because they were afraid-- 

SUBJECT 2: That he would cry. 

SUBJECT 1: That he would cry or something. So I had to carry him. And I ran through-- 

SUBJECT 2: Woods. 

SUBJECT 1: All kinds of woods to-- also to our destinations. They knew where it was already-- 

SUBJECT 2: Until we met. 

SUBJECT 1: --deep in Belgium. It was maybe 10 miles or something like this. 

And then we had cars. And they picked us up and brought us there. 

INTERVIEWER: Stop for a second. 

I think there's a misunderstanding between us. What you told me in the other room is not recorded. We have to go again to-- 

SUBJECT 1: This was over the border. This was-- 

INTERVIEWER: Where did you-- 

SUBJECT 1: Belgium territory. 

SUBJECT 2: The outskirt. 

SUBJECT 1: They came with the truck. And we had to walk. We came two hours later. 

SUBJECT 2: And we met there in that farm house. 

INTERVIEWER: Why? Why did you have to be separate? 

SUBJECT 2: Because he had the-- because he was afraid when we go in the truck where the double wall is. And when we come-- 

SUBJECT 1: He might cry or something. 

SUBJECT 2: He might cry. Then the whole thing would be lost. Then they would say, who do you have here? 

When the man stop the truck, he says, what do you have here? He says I have vegetables and fruit by the border. And he says, go ahead. He gave the OK. 

So they-- 

INTERVIEWER: This is before the German border, or after the German border? 

SUBJECT 1: After the German border. 

SUBJECT 2: No. That's how we went to Belgium. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. But, you see, from the-- let's say from the German border, they expected us. 

SUBJECT 2: Right. 

SUBJECT 1: And they took us to a certain space-- place. And they said, here is a truck. [INAUDIBLE]. 

And-- 

SUBJECT 2: Then we went-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. Yeah. So a certain place where a farm was. 

And from the farm they had to take us-- again, it was checkpoints. You know, they check. 

So they said the women can-- women without-- or men without children can go in the truck. But children they can't take. So we give you a man. 

SUBJECT 2: They separated. 

SUBJECT 1: They separated us, and took us through woods a few miles till all the-- a different destination, you know. Then we came-- 

INTERVIEWER: So you crossed the border-- 

SUBJECT 2: I crossed the border in a truck, in a double wall. 

And I heard when we came to the border-- 

INTERVIEWER: The Belgium border. 

SUBJECT 2: The Belgium border-- and that they asked him, what do you have here? He says, I have vegetables and fruit. He says, go. 

So then later I met my husband. And with this-- with child, and the other men. And we met there. 

INTERVIEWER: And you crossed the border-- 

SUBJECT 2: By foot. 

SUBJECT 1: By foot. 

SUBJECT 2: Wondering at night through the woods. 

SUBJECT 1: And I'm not running. Not-- 

SUBJECT 2: You had to run to come to the same time. 

INTERVIEWER: With a child. 

SUBJECT 1: With the child. 

SUBJECT 2: He was two years old. 

KURT KORALL: Did they have somebody with you? A guide? 

SUBJECT 1: Uh-huh. Sure we had a guide. 

SUBJECT 2: Sure. He had a guide. They wouldn't find their way. You had the smuggler that was departed. 

SUBJECT 1: He was running with us. 

SUBJECT 2: He was running, and doing, and same where he has-- 

SUBJECT 1: It was a whole organization. They was-- they were on trees they gave signs-- 

SUBJECT 2: Signs from trees. 

SUBJECT 1: Where the bor-- where the police is. You know that that's the way out. 

SUBJECT 2: Until we landed in Antwerp. 

And then we came there, we had no bed, nowhere to sleep, or anything. 

So they told us there's a committee, a Jewish committee. We should go there. 

When we came there, they said, well, you have to look yourself for an apartment. 

SUBJECT 1: And we didn't have any money. So they gave us money. 

SUBJECT 2: A little money. 

INTERVIEWER: Who is they? 

SUBJECT 2: The committee. The committee. Jewish committee. 

And we had a cousin who lived. And he says, you go with me. And we went to a market. And we bought old beds. And we got an apartment. 

And we were eight people, was it two, four, six in one room with a kitchen. And we had to sleep the night. 

After this we went to the committee the next day. And they gave us food. We ate there. And they also gave us money. 

And if you want me to bring that up, we met across the street there was a family living. And they were none Jewish people. And one day I went with Kurt walking. All of a sudden a package fell on the floor. 

And I walked because I knew-- I don't know anybody. So the woman calls me. She says madame, madame, It's for you. But I said, I don't know anybody. 

She says, yes, it's for you. They saw across the street how we live. And they felt they want to do something for us. And they saw we had two small children. 

So she spoke to me. She was a younger woman. She says, look, my mother is quite well to do, and she'd like to help you. She sees you that you are going to the committee to eat. 

And so she-- she goes to auctions. And she wants to furnish your room. And she wants to give for your children beds. She doesn't give it as a gift, but she wants to lend it to you. 

And they helped us an awful lot. They were very nice. And they saw to it that we could make a fire. They gave us coals. 

And that's how we went through this until-- there was the time before Hitler came they didn't do anything to the Jewish people in Belgium. They made good business. And so my husband worked there in a bakery. 

INTERVIEWER: Could you get papers in Belgium? 

SUBJECT 2: We didn't-- we-- 

SUBJECT 1: In the beginning, no. 

SUBJECT 2: We were-- we were-- als-- Durchreise 

You know, they told us we are transit. Whenever the war is over we have to leave. And so my husband worked in a bakery. And there was quite a relat-- far relative. And Kurt was too small to go to school. So somehow it worked out. But we always knew, it's not going to be like this. Because we had the experience from Vienna. 

But the people in Belgium, the Jewish people said, oh, come on. Don't tell me these stories. It couldn't happen here. And look how nice they are. 

And one night, it's changed. The Belgium people were picked up. And we had to go in hiding. 

INTERVIEWER: That you are now, after the war was-- 

SUBJECT 2: No. No. No. That is before. Before the big war started. No. That was 19-- 

SUBJECT 1: When Hitler marched into Belgium. 

INTERVIEWER: Belgium. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. Much-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: That was in 1940. May-- 

SUBJECT 2: No. It was later. 1941 maybe. 

SUBJECT 1: It was '41. 

SUBJECT 2: I think in Belgium. Then he took over Belgium. 

Maybe 1940. But they started doing bad things in 1941. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. '41 was-- 1941-- 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember-- 

SUBJECT 1: We had a little-- 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the Hitler-- the German occupation of Belgium? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

KURT KORALL: The day. 

SUBJECT 1: Huh? 

KURT KORALL: The day that they occupied. 

SUBJECT 1: What? 

SUBJECT 2: The day when this happened. 

SUBJECT 1: The date I don't remember. 

SUBJECT 2: We don't remember too much. 

INTERVIEWER: Not date. But what happened? How did you see the Germans coming into Belgium? 

SUBJECT 2: Well, wait a minute. 1940 we went-- when Hitler-- when they said Hitler's going to come into Belgium, we went to-- how do you call-- we went to-- we wanted to go away. 

So we left the apartment. Gave everything to my-- to the lovely people. And we left with a train. Destiny Friends. 

And on the way our train was bombed. And we had to throw us through the window and on the floor. And we were laying there. And that's-- and all of a sudden a couple came by with a little wagon. And they saw us laying with a small child. And the men approached us. 

SUBJECT 1: In the fields. 

SUBJECT 2: In the field. And the men approached. He says, what is it? What are you doing? 

I said, I don't know what to do. I have nothing to eat, and I cannot walk anymore. And he says, you give the child on that wagon. And your husband's going to push that wagon. And you. And I know ways how to go through woods that the bomb shouldn't hit us, and the shrapnels. 

And we walked and walked for miles and miles. And we stayed overnight in the-- Scheune 

INTERVIEWER: Barn. 

SUBJECT 1: In the barn. 

SUBJECT 2: Barn overnight. 

And in the morning, all of a sudden we see the German army. We were-- the man says, I'm sorry. We have to leave you. We are too much afraid. And we know you are Jewish people. We have to leave you. 

So the German army came over. And they asked me, what are you doing here? I told them I'm Jewish. He says, it doesn't matter. We have no auftrag to do anything wrong. We're going to bring you home back to Antwerp, or to Brussels. 

So they brought us food. And he says, go in there. Everything was empty. People left. All of the Belgium people left because they were afraid for 1914, 1918 war what the German people did. 

So we were-- so they said to us, they had auftrag. 

INTERVIEWER: Orders. 

SUBJECT 2: To be nice orders. To be nice. And to take the people who were wandering around to the cities where they belonged. 

So then an officer came over. And he says, I tell you something, you don't look Jewish. You know what, the army's going to come soon. You can eat. You go there and you ask for food. But your husband hide. He looks too Jewish. 

But then there came an officer with a-- with a truck. He says, we have orders to bring you to the city you belong. 

So they came. They brought us directly to Antwerp first. But-- to Antwerp first. 

Then Hitler said the Jewish people cannot live near-- 

SUBJECT 1: A port. 

SUBJECT 2: A port. 

So-- 

SUBJECT 1: We have to-- 

SUBJECT 2: We should leave for Brussels. 

SUBJECT 1: No. No. No. 

SUBJECT 2: But before-- 

SUBJECT 1: --in Antwerp they arrested us. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. They arrested us after that. But-- 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe-- 

SUBJECT 2: And they came back for the flucht. We still were in Antwerp. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. But-- 

SUBJECT 2: Later. 

SUBJECT 1: You see, in Antwerp we were living there under Hitler maybe a year or less before-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: And my wife told you before, one day I was working in the bakery-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. We forgot the story really that-- 

SUBJECT 1: And a woman and a gentleman came. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: Mr. Korall, your wife was with child. 

SUBJECT 2: We told him that. 

SUBJECT 1: Huh? 

INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. We told you that. 

SUBJECT 1: I told him. Yeah. I told the doctor. And-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: Laub there. Not here. 

So your wife is-- the gestapo came in the house. And they are taking away your wife with your child. 

So right away-- I had a bicycle. I came with the bicycle. Right away in the house, and they took me too. They closed the apartment. And they put us in a school. A few hundred or a 1,000 people. I don't know. A lot of people. 

We stayed overnight. In the morning they took us to a train, put us on the train. They locked up the trains, you know. And it's supposed to go to-- 

SUBJECT 2: Poland. 

SUBJECT 1: Poland. Destination. That was what one SR told us. Then you will work. Something like this, he mentioned. 

So after a night riding in the train, it was maybe 2 o'clock in the morning, or 3 o'clock in the morning. 

SUBJECT 2: And it was snowing. And winter. 

SUBJECT 1: It was cold. This was their fight by Stalingrad. 

INTERVIEWER: That's December 1942. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: 1942. 

SUBJECT 2: That's why they couldn't take us to Poland. 

SUBJECT 1: He said, everything has to get-- everybody has to get out. 

So they didn't put all us out. 

SUBJECT 2: In parts. 

SUBJECT 1: In parts. You know. 

SUBJECT 2: 20. 

SUBJECT 1: They put in every village-- 

SUBJECT 2: People. 

SUBJECT 1: Lots of people. And, so now-- 

INTERVIEWER: They simply let Jews out of the train. 

SUBJECT 2: Out of the train. 

SUBJECT 1: It was under-- anyhow, it was gestapo. The Belgium gestapo was there. 

And they took us to farm houses. 

SUBJECT 2: To little-- 

SUBJECT 1: To little houses for the time being. We had to go every day to report to the-- 

SUBJECT 2: We had six, eight people together, one room and a kitchen. When we came in it was late at night. There was no bed. One bed. And all straw on the floor. 

We didn't know where we are. And there was another couple also. And so she said to me, you know, you have a small child. There's one bed. You go and sleep there. And we will sleep on the floor. 

In the morning we got up. We look around. Nothing far. Nothing. Where should we go? What shall we do? Where should we eat something? So that all the women said to my husband, why don't you go out and give a look where we are. What are we going to do? 

My husband goes out. And he comes in in a farmhouse. And there's a bauer. And he says, we have no food. We have nothing. 

SUBJECT 1: They thought we are Germans. 

SUBJECT 2: So he came-- he came back. 

SUBJECT 1: They didn't know what a Jew means, you. 

SUBJECT 2: No. He came back, and he says, oy, yoi, oy, they have also only straw. 

But that woman was-- the older woman, she says, come with me. Lets go. You speak Flemish a little bit. Maybe. We go. 

So we went another entrance. And there was also that man. And I told him that I have a small child. And we need a little milk or something. 

He says, do you have stamps? Because you needed marks. I said, yes, I have. 

That was the first day. We had only a little milk for him. And we had to wait the next day. We went again in. And he says, what are you really? 

We said, we are Jewish people. He says, Jewish people I've never seen in my life. I thought Jewish have noses like this. Don't look like this. 

We said, don't be afraid. We're not German. We're Jewish. 

So my husband started to work for them in the farms and on-- 

SUBJECT 1: No. No. The next day the police in the church. 

SUBJECT 2: Oh yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: Made a speech. 

SUBJECT 2: Made a speech. 

SUBJECT 1: You see this is people-- they are-- 

SUBJECT 2: Not. They're not German. 

SUBJECT 1: They are not Germans. And we should help them. And the community gave us right away money. 

But we were under the gestapo, the Belgium gestapo. We had to go every day to report. But still we were free. 

So I went to work by a farmer. And he gave us food. 

SUBJECT 2: They gave us food. Six months they took us. 

SUBJECT 1: Six months. 

SUBJECT 2: --that we lived on that farm there. And nothing happened. 

SUBJECT 1: After six months came our order. 

INTERVIEWER: You mentioned a child. What was the child-- what was it to have a child through all this? 

SUBJECT 2: Hm? 

INTERVIEWER: You had a child. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: What was it like to have a child? 

SUBJECT 2: It was very bad because we wanted him to have the best, and he couldn't have it. So-- but he wasn't spoiled. He was already used not too much to eat. 

And the farmers saw that we are nice people. And so more and more they gave us butter, and eggs, and bread, and everything. And not-- and he was young. He didn't go to school or anything. So he liked to go with the farmer on that wagon. And he went along with them on the farms all over. And he liked it. 

And that's how he was brought up, six months long. After six months-- 

INTERVIEWER: I want to come back with a question. 

SUBJECT 2: He was the only child. 

INTERVIEWER: The only child. Was it-- how were you different from other people, having a child? 

SUBJECT 2: Maybe it was a better way, because they figured, all right, she has the child. Let her have for the child more. And people considered that, that if you have a child, give him the milk instead of me. 

And we lived with one woman. And she went through the war, 1914, 1918. And she had a lot of experiences. From the little potatoes she made all kind of things, and learned me, and teached me how to do things in a practical way. 

And my husband went in the woods. And he brought home wood. And we had a fire. 

INTERVIEWER: When you thought of fleeing, of escaping, how-- was it for the child's sake? 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. I only wanted to know. I want to save my child was all what I was thinking. So I figured he's so young. He didn't go through anything. I want to save my child. 

And that's how I later gave it in the cloister, because I wanted to save him. 

So after six months we were-- 

INTERVIEWER: So it was [INAUDIBLE] of trying harder because-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. Because I had a child. Yes. 

And after-- after six months we were there, the Germans said-- 

INTERVIEWER: What was he like? 

SUBJECT 2: Who? He? 

INTERVIEWER: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: He was-- 

SUBJECT 1: Terrific. 

SUBJECT 2: He was a good child. 

KURT KORALL: Just like now. 

SUBJECT 2: And he wasn't-- you know, he just-- 

INTERVIEWER: He was four years old? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. He was four years old. 

And I don't know. Somehow he liked the people, the farm people. And they had not children. 

SUBJECT 1: Now, that's-- 

SUBJECT 2: --all not married, in fact. And they liked him, and they took him along. And this was OK. 

INTERVIEWER: What was he like on trains, or in hiding-- 

SUBJECT 2: In trains he behaved very well. He was very good natured. So he behaved well. 

INTERVIEWER: In dangerous moments, what-- 

SUBJECT 2: Under-- when we were fluchting, flucht, he was so thirsty. And he got sore throat. And he was sick. And I only pray to-- he should have a little bit milk or anything to drink. It was not easy to go through this with a child. 

But the only thing was, we wanted to save him. 

SUBJECT 1: So anyhow, we were-- 

INTERVIEWER: Do you want to talk about the child about more? 

[MUMBLING] 

SUBJECT 2: Really just all people said, you know, you have-- there was very little children on our trip there. So that's fine. I don't know what can I say more. I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER: What was it for you to have him around? What was it like? What do you remember from those days? 

SUBJECT 1: Terrific. All my life was around him. Because he was-- you know, when you have a child, your first child, we loved him very much. And our-- 

SUBJECT 2: We wanted to save him. 

SUBJECT 1: And our life was only to save him. 

SUBJECT 2: And-- 

INTERVIEWER: Did you-- he was four already. Did you explain things to him? Did you have-- 

SUBJECT 2: Not too much. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you? 

SUBJECT 1: No. No. I didn't explain-- 

When did we-- wait a minute. He was four when we gave him to the farmer. 

KURT KORALL: Four or five. 

SUBJECT 2: This was, I think, later. 

SUBJECT 1: No. 

SUBJECT 2: When we came back to Brussels. That was later. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. How old was he? 

SUBJECT 2: 1937-- 

SUBJECT 1: Two years. 

SUBJECT 2: He's born. When we came-- when we came to Belgium he was- 

SUBJECT 1: No. '42 we went through-- 

SUBJECT 2: He's five years old. 

SUBJECT 1: Five years old. 

SUBJECT 2: Four or five years old. 

SUBJECT 1: So five years old. We came back. No. No. 

SUBJECT 2: Wait a minute. No. After-- I have to tell it like this, after six months we stayed there in the small town. They announced the women and children have to go back. 

SUBJECT 1: To Brussels. 

SUBJECT 2: And the men have to-- 

SUBJECT 1: Not to Antwerp. 

SUBJECT 2: To Brussels. And the men have to stay on. 

So I had to take my child. And I went to Antwerp. And I let the people who were so nice to me, I wrote to them, I have to leave. 

She waited for me with a bicycle on the train. And she says, don't your worry. My mother's going to take care of you like you would be my own daughter. And she took me into her house. I had nowhere else to go. And it was dangerous for her, because when the German people would know that-- they wouldn't like it that she hides Jewish people. But she took that chance. 

And I was staying by her for a while. And she said to me, my mother has a house. And I want you to stay in that house. 

I left her. And we stayed in a house. And then they came something that we have to leave Antwerp. And my husband came back from-- from-- 

SUBJECT 1: From the-- 

SUBJECT 2: From dort, from there 

SUBJECT 1: From Weichmann, that was-- 

SUBJECT 2: From-- that the orchard was Weichmann. 

SUBJECT 1: In Limburg on the border from-- 

SUBJECT 2: Belgium. 

SUBJECT 1: The Netherlands. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: So I was working there. And one day they said I can go back because they want, again to get us together. 

SUBJECT 2: But not to Antwerp. 

SUBJECT 1: And yes, so I came back. 

SUBJECT 2: But not to Antwerp. We have to-- 

SUBJECT 1: Now to Brussels. 

SUBJECT 2: We have to live in Brussels. So we had no apartment there. 

SUBJECT 1: As soon as we came to Brussels, we went right away in hiding. 

SUBJECT 2: And we decided we have to give away Kurt. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. And one day-- yeah. It was a Judenrat. And they said-- the Judenrat gave us advice. 

SUBJECT 2: To give them the children. 

SUBJECT 1: Give them the children. 

SUBJECT 2: They had a home-- a children home. 

SUBJECT 1: So I gave to the Judenrat. They had a home. And I gave Kurtie away. 

SUBJECT 2: They said that the-- Hit-- the army-- the German people said, they're not going to touch these children. 

SUBJECT 1: Children they wouldn't touch. 

SUBJECT 2: So we gave him away to-- 

SUBJECT 1: They gave him away. 

INTERVIEWER: And all this you were traveling. You were hiding. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Wasn't he asking questions? Didn't you have to explain something? 

SUBJECT 2: We told him not to scream, not to be loud, because when we were hiding somewhere maybe somebody should hear and so on. But before we took him to the Judenrat, I think we gave him away to Belgium people. Wasn't it like that? 

SUBJECT 1: The first Belgian people. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. At first I think [INAUDIBLE]. 

SUBJECT 1: Now, first I heard rumors-- 

SUBJECT 2: Wait a minute. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you explain to him all-- 

SUBJECT 2: Wait! 

INTERVIEWER: --the war. 

SUBJECT 2: When we decided to give him away we told him there is a nice man going to come. And he's going to take you. And he's going to be very nice. 

SUBJECT 1: And he will take care of you. 

SUBJECT 2: Will take care of you. 

SUBJECT 1: You know what's going on. And he didn't understand too much about-- he didn't realize-- in this age he didn't realize what's going on. 

SUBJECT 2: This was a lovely Belgian people. 

SUBJECT 1: So we-- we, through this gentile family, we found out it's a farmer. And he was ready. He didn't have children. He will take him in. 

And he went to the farmer. And we were very happy he took him. 

SUBJECT 2: He paid for-- 

SUBJECT 1: In a matter of fact, in the hiding place, once he came to Brussels-- this was in a small village. And he brought us-- we didn't recognize him. 

SUBJECT 2: No. No. Wait a minute. He came back. And he says he has to bring him back. Because people in the small town-- 

INTERVIEWER: The Belgian farmer. 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. 

Spoke about that he has a Jewish child. So he says, it's too dangerous. And I was looking. If you're still here, if they didn't take you, I mean, [INAUDIBLE]. So he says, I have to bring you back. 

So then we decided to the Judenrat to take him there. So there he was a short time. 

SUBJECT 1: The one, it was a short time. Then there was a rumor the gestapo will pick up the children. 

SUBJECT 2: All these Jewish children. 

SUBJECT 1: So I had a gentile friend, a very influential man, a big man. 

SUBJECT 2: No. First, [INAUDIBLE]. 

SUBJECT 1: And I came to the Judenrat. And I said, I want my child back. He said the child belongs to us. You don't have a right-- any rights to the child. 

SUBJECT 2: You better bring your linens. 

SUBJECT 1: Bring everything what you have because you will picked up-- you will be picked up. And they take you away. And the child will be alive. 

So bring everything. We should have everything. 

SUBJECT 2: And he didn't want to give the child back. 

SUBJECT 1: So he didn't want to. So I went to this gentile fellow. And I told him this story. 

So he said, I will go there. 

SUBJECT 2: They took him. 

SUBJECT 1: He had a gun. It was a big, this, from the police or something. And he came to the Judenrat. He said, I want this child back. 

We said, we can't give you because he's registered with the gestapo already. He says, I don't care. If you don't give me the back, I kill you right away. 

So he gave him the child back. 

SUBJECT 2: And then we got him back. There was a rumor. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. We got him back. 

SUBJECT 2: There was rumors again about how-- 

SUBJECT 1: It was rumors again. You know, somebody told me, it's in Leuven, this university, You have to run. 

SUBJECT 2: In Brussels, [INAUDIBLE]. 

SUBJECT 1: And so [INAUDIBLE] he said. 

INTERVIEWER: When? 

SUBJECT 1: You know-- 

SUBJECT 2: So some-- 

SUBJECT 1: Leivan, Leuven. 

SUBJECT 2: Leuven. 

SUBJECT 1: Leuven. 

That was a cloister. You know, a cloister. 

SUBJECT 2: They take Jewish children, some friend told us. 

SUBJECT 1: Mis- recorded. 

SUBJECT 2: The name. 

SUBJECT 1: You are only tripled nuns, and triple this. And there they take Jewish people. 

SUBJECT 2: So I went with my child and my other girl friend. She had a girl. And we went to that cloister. And we came there. They told us, all right. We take your child. But you must know. Only you will-- 

SUBJECT 1: You have to sign. 

SUBJECT 2: You have to sign that you will get the child back, but nobody else. I had to sign that. 

SUBJECT 1: And you signed. 

SUBJECT 2: And they gave him another name. 

SUBJECT 1: This child belongs to us. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. And we give him other name. And after four weeks I went to visit him. I could not recognize him. He looked different. All together different. 

And that gave him in a-- he was then maybe-- how old would he have been? Five years? 

SUBJECT 1: Five years. 

SUBJECT 2: So they gave him to children who are three years old, because she says, now, look, he doesn't know the language. And if I give him for five, six-year-old children they will say, who is he? He doesn't speak the language. This will not be good. 

So they gave him to three three year old. And that-- after six weeks she says he speaks beautiful French. 

So after I came there, he cried terribly. He wanted to go home. And he told-- 

SUBJECT 1: And he knew already what's going on. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: First of all, he didn't get food. He told us-- 

SUBJECT 2: When he was in the cloister. 

SUBJECT 1: Look, I get only potatoes, and I get the-- 

SUBJECT 2: And not only this. He was a little religious. And he liked to pray. And he says, ma, when I have a toothache or anything she tells me, kiss Jesus' legs. Then you're not going to have it. And he says, and after I go to sleep I still say Shema Yisrael. 

And I went back. And I figured he has to stay there. And that's where stayed on there. And we lived-- 

SUBJECT 1: We were in hiding. 

SUBJECT 2: --in hiding. Every time another-- 

SUBJECT 1: Another place. 

SUBJECT 2: Another apartment. And other places. 

SUBJECT 1: And I'm-- and we were lucky, I tell you. 

SUBJECT 2: They couldn't-- 

SUBJECT 1: In our house one night they came and they took the first floor, the second floor, wherever Jews were. And I was living at the third floor. And they had to know-- and-- 

SUBJECT 2: They asked the landlady, is there somebody else living? 

SUBJECT 1: And asked her. 

SUBJECT 2: And we were-- 

SUBJECT 1: And she said no. 

SUBJECT 2: She said no, because-- she says we were very lucky. We were sitting just and not walking. Otherwise you could have heard the walking. So that's why we were saved. 

SUBJECT 1: We had a cousin on the second floor. They picked him up. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. So that's how we were saved, until the liberation came. And then we took him out from the cloister. 

SUBJECT 1: This was-- 

SUBJECT 2: And that we will never forget. 

INTERVIEWER: Let's go back. 

KURT KORALL: My name is Kurt Korall. And I was born in Vienna in 1937. And really the first memory that I have is of the-- I think the orphanage-- Jewish orphanage that I was at first-- the memories before that-- 

SUBJECT 1: Somebody pissed at you. 

KURT KORALL: Yeah. Somebody did urinate on me. 

[LAUGHTER] 

SUBJECT 1: You're in-- they-- it was-- they had double beds. 

KURT KORALL: I-- 

SUBJECT 1: The young kids. 

KURT KORALL: The time before that I can't really remember. Or I think what I do remember were things that were told to me. 

INTERVIEWER: The orphanage and the Judenrat. 

KURT KORALL: Yeah. The Jewish orphanage. 

INTERVIEWER: In Brussels. 

KURT KORALL: Right. 

And the only memories I have of-- 

SUBJECT 1: The farmer you remember too? 

KURT KORALL: No. 

SUBJECT 2: No? 

SUBJECT 1: No? You don't remember? It was a handsome fellow. 

KURT KORALL: I don't remember that at all. 

SUBJECT 2: He doesn't remember that. 

SUBJECT 1: But the cloister, you remember? 

SUBJECT 2: Oh yeah. 

KURT KORALL: Yeah. Well, that came afterwards. The-- the only thing I remember about the orphanage at all is that it was extremely crowded, and that there were a lot of kids always in one room sleeping, usually in bunk beds. And the days were sort of noisy, crowded. 

And that's where that incident-- there was a-- there was a boy. And we were on bunk beds. And he slept above me. And he apparently urinated constantly while asleep at night. And I would get wet at night [INAUDIBLE] morning. 

But I would complain when my-- did you come there? I don't remember. 

SUBJECT 2: No. Mr-- Mrs. Frankl's son, Laks, he was there, Mach somehow. 

KURT KORALL: He was an official. 

SUBJECT 2: Right. 

And he-- you told him. 

KURT KORALL: I complained to him. 

INTERVIEWER: What--
