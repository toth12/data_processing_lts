INTERVIEWER: Mhm. 

SUBJECT 1: --slave camp, slavery camp. So I took her with me in the shop and she was working there with me. 

INTERVIEWER: Mrs. Stadtlender can you tell us where you were born and your maiden name, what year? 

SUBJECT 2: I'm born in Pultusk, March 1922. And in 1937, we moved to Lodz. I had a sister and a brother. 

And that's where we start a new life in Lodz. And two years later, Hitler came to power. And walked in, like, marched in through Lodz. 

INTERVIEWER: Tell me about your life before the 1939. Any-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. I was in Pultusk and I went to school. I got my seven school years, like there is high school, but there's public school, of course. And after this, mine father and mother wants to teach me a trade. 

And I was-- I don't know how to say in English, but I embroidered shirts, pillowcases, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] I don't know how you say it in this country. We never had--we never had this trade. And they want us to move to Israel because my grandfather used to be there. 

But it was awful hard for him to bring us to Israel because a father cannot bring children. Children can always bring parents to this country. So they tried to teach me a trade. 

And my grandfather saw with somebody else to bring me over there so I can bring my parents to Israel. But didn't work out that good. Because Hitler came to power in 1939, and everything was off. 

INTERVIEWER: Why did you want to leave Poland before 1939? 

SUBJECT 2: Because my father has their father-- I got a grandfather in Israel. We wanted to move there. That's the only reason. We want to be together. 

INTERVIEWER: But your life was good in Pultusk? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. It was pretty good. My father was a bookkeeper. He was make a pretty good living. But we wanted to be together. That my two aunts-- were there, still in Israel. 

INTERVIEWER: What kind of a town was Pultusk? 

SUBJECT 2: Pultusk was a little city not far from Warsaw, and, like, a half an hour ride by bus. And-- 

INTERVIEWER: Mostly Jews or non-Jews? 

SUBJECT 2: Mixed. 

INTERVIEWER: Mixed. 

SUBJECT 2: But they used to live in a Jewish neighborhood like here we try everything the same almost. And thus we wanted to move to Israel. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you feel any discrimination in Pultusk or-- 

SUBJECT 2: Not much-- I don't remember too much but as far as I know in the school and was nothing about these things. Either maybe was, but I don't remember that much of this. 

INTERVIEWER: There was nothing in school? No difference between Jew and non-Jew? 

SUBJECT 2: No, no, it was mixed-- public school, of course. The kids was almost like here. The kids don't know nothing about hating each other. Maybe some of the higher classes they wouldn't admit you because you're Jewish. But I didn't know about this, because I didn't try to go to there. 1937 we move out from Pultusk to Lodz. 

INTERVIEWER: Why? 

SUBJECT 2: I told you I want to learn a trade and to go to Israel. From a bigger city, it's easy to go like from a smaller. That's the reason we left Pultusk and we came to Lodz. 

INTERVIEWER: And where did you move in Lodz? To what did you move in? 

SUBJECT 2: We moved in a nice neighborhood, in a very nice neighborhood in Lodz. And it wasn't for too long for good. Because 1939, they sent us. Of course, a little bit later, we moved to the ghetto. 

And at the ghetto we got a very hard time. We got a place wasn't so decent either, like a basement apartment. We couldn't get something better. And we was together with everybody else, with all the Jews, [INAUDIBLE] place, like they say. And it wasn't too pleasant. 

And then they took us to work. And my father was very religious. He didn't want to work on Saturdays and this and this. We tried to hide him in the house. And we went to look for him. Me with my sister-- my sister was smaller than me. My brother was a young kid. Because I was the oldest in the house. 

When Hitler came to power, I was 18 years, and my sister was 16. My brother was 14. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you remember about those first few days when Hitler came in? 

SUBJECT 2: Well, we was talking that the Germans was pretty good, maybe, in the first World War. Maybe they're not going to be as bad in the second World War. 

But we were mistaken. There was a different kind Germans. They treated not to humanity, right away with killing, with robbing and sent them away to this place like a nation wasn't civilized. 

INTERVIEWER: You said that you hoped-- that the Germans were good to the Polish people in the First World War, and you thought they would be good again. 

SUBJECT 2: That's what we thought. Be like my mother told me. Maybe not going to be as bad, because the Second World War, they saved us--they saved them from the Russians. They figure maybe this time's going to be not as bad like happened to be. 

INTERVIEWER: You didn't know about their discrimination against Jews in Germany? You hadn't heard that? 

SUBJECT 2: No, I didn't know too much, maybe didn't read as much. But my mother used to tell me that the Germans used to do better than the Russians in the First World War. Maybe they're not going to be as bad this time. 

But looks like just happened the opposite, was terrible. Starting from the ghetto, they sent us away to to burn, to rob these things. They moved us. They kicked us. They're terrible. 

But the worst thing what happened in the ghetto, being there a year-- oh! This scene I'll never forget. Right away they took the religious people with the beards for the talleisim you know, they made the-- like, here, the green. They call it [INAUDIBLE] [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

They made big-- a big, big grave, a hole. And after they finished, they said to jump in, a 10-- 10 Jewish people, the older ones. And the other ones have to shuffle the sand on the top of them. [INAUDIBLE] How can you forget these things? That's what happened in the ghetto. In Lodz. 

INTERVIEWER: You saw this? 

SUBJECT 2: I saw this-- they want us to come to see what happened. Nobody wants to see it. So we closed our eyes. 

And they hit us over the hand and everything. We got to see these things. And this was terrible, terrible. 

INTERVIEWER: Who brought you down? Where-- who took you to see it? 

SUBJECT 2: They called us to come to the green, like here, the green. We got to come, all of us. 

INTERVIEWER: Who called? 

SUBJECT 2: One lady to another, the Germans go then on the streets, and they call everybody out from the houses and come to the-- they went out with-- with the trucks. And call and cuss everybody out on the green. Everybody out on the green. 

We didn't know what's all about it. We figured they're going to send us away right away from beginning. This was one year. You remember this? 

SUBJECT 1: I feel I remember this. 

SUBJECT 2: He was in Lodz, in the ghetto. 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe that day that they called you and how they called you, Mr. Stadtlender? Do you remember? Did they use a microphone? How did they-- how did you hear it? 

SUBJECT 1: They didn't use-- 

SUBJECT 2: They howled. Howled from the houses. 

SUBJECT 1: They'll come to the house, let's say, over there. You know? 

INTERVIEWER: The Germans? 

SUBJECT 1: And houses over there, they had big places around each house. You know? They came down, you know, and they call down to send up somebody. Oh, neighbors, you have to come down.

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. Big. 

SUBJECT 1: How big your apartment used to be about 50, 60 apartments, you know? 

SUBJECT 2: 50 tenants-- where, of course, we didn't have five rooms. So one room-- 

SUBJECT 1: One room-- 

SUBJECT 2: One room are family. 

SUBJECT 1: One room was enough, you know? 

SUBJECT 2: And that's what happened. And this was a terrible scene. 

SUBJECT 1: They called us down and then, you know, they took us over there to the place. What they do is they showed us what they do to the Jewish people. 

SUBJECT 2: Terrible! 

INTERVIEWER: What did they do? 

SUBJECT 2: They got to put in the talleisim. 

SUBJECT 1: You know, you've got to put in talleisim. They have to say a prayer. You know, one of them has to say a prayer. 

And they make a joke out of it, like the Jewish people used to pray. They make a prayer. And after, when you finished the prayer, they pushed him down-- one after another, one after another. 

SUBJECT 2: And the other ones that were standing around have to put the sand on the top of them. 

SUBJECT 1: And then-- and then they called another Jew. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: And they give him, you know, a scissors, they cut off the beard. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: When he was done, they throw him down, too. 

INTERVIEWER: They--

INTERVIEWER: They didn't kill them? They just threw them in? 

SUBJECT 2: They threw them alive. They threw them alive. 

SUBJECT 1: Then they-- they-- they buried them alive. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: They buried them alive? 

SUBJECT 1: Alive, alive. 

SUBJECT 2: Remember the [? [NON-ENGLISH]? ?] Oh, alive-- one on another has to pull the beard. And this was-- merciful. I don't know. They were howling [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

SUBJECT 1: You can't-- you can't talk about it. 

SUBJECT 2: It's terrible. 

INTERVIEWER: I don't want to upset you. And I feel badly about pressing you. But I don't understand this scene. They brought you down to a gathering place. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Then they took you where? 

SUBJECT 2: To a place where they digged out a big hole, like here-- 

SUBJECT 1: A big grave, you know? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. They did-- they have to do it for themself. The Jewish people have to do it for themself. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. They was doing, digging--

SUBJECT 1: Not the whole ghetto, you know, they took-- 

SUBJECT 2: Whatever-- whatever they catched working or going or in the houses, they asked to come to the green. So then they give them shovels to dig a big hole, whatever they call it. 

And then when they finished, they said to the religious Jews to put on the talleisim.

INTERVIEWER: But they weren't dead? They were just buried alive? 

SUBJECT 2: Most was dead. How can you lay down with the-- 

SUBJECT 1: What they threw down there, all of them were dead. 

SUBJECT 2: Mostly dead?

INTERVIEWER: They shot them first? 

SUBJECT 2: Not all of them. 

SUBJECT 1: Not all of them. 

SUBJECT 2: Jumped alive. 

SUBJECT 1: Those-- those people didn't want to go down, you know. And they shot them in the back. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, if they don't want to go down, they're shot.

INTERVIEWER: What did you think when you saw this? What did you-- 

SUBJECT 1: What can you do? 

SUBJECT 2: Terrible! What can you do? 

SUBJECT 1: You cannot do nothing. You cannot do nothing. That's it. 

INTERVIEWER: Weren't you very frightened? 

SUBJECT 2: Of course. 

SUBJECT 1: I was frightened. I was frightened all the time, even if I went to work, you know, in the ghetto, I was frightened. And afraid to go to walk the streets. 

SUBJECT 2: You don't know if you're going to be next. That's what it was. 

SUBJECT 1: And to get there, you have to walk-- this is the place where you have to walk. You cannot walk even here, two-- two steps away. 

SUBJECT 2: After seven, we couldn't go out from the houses. 

SUBJECT 1: No. No. 

INTERVIEWER: The curfew was at 7:00? 

SUBJECT 1: The curfew. 

SUBJECT 2: I don't remember seven. I know we cannot go out in the evenings. Never went out anywhere. 

SUBJECT 1: After seven. You have to stay until six sometimes. 

SUBJECT 2: After seven, maybe you remember better. I know we couldn't go out in the evenings. So it was a terrible time in the ghetto. That's what, uh-- even concentration was bad. 

But some people say concentration was the worst thing. It's true. But the ghetto for us wasn't good either. 

INTERVIEWER: Why? 

SUBJECT 2: Because first of all, the rations even with the food. They gave you a loaf of bread for one week. You want to eat it at once, or you want to cut it in pieces. But if you're so hungry, you cannot leave for tomorrow if you're so hungry today. 

Then they give us a piece of the dry fish. And then they give us a little bit of this and a little bit of that for the whole week. And this was terrible to live on it. 

Of course, we managed that little bit because we-- you know, it was my mother, my father, my sister, my brother. So we tried to use a little bit, little bit at a time, so it would stretch us for the whole week. But it was awful hard to live on it. 

INTERVIEWER: Didn't earn some money when you were working and couldn't you buy things-- 

SUBJECT 2: Money? It was no money in the ghetto for us to earn. 

SUBJECT 1: [INAUDIBLE]. I got paid money. Special money, they made special money. 

SUBJECT 2: I don't know. They told us to go to the store with coupons. Maybe I don't remember. 

SUBJECT 1: They give you the coupons. That's what's different for the money. They made special money. They printed the special money for the ghetto, for the ghetto, you know? 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. And couldn't you buy-- 

SUBJECT 1: I worked the whole week, so I got them, you know, you're like coupons. With that coupon, you go and buy, you know, what you get, what the government give you. 

SUBJECT 2: No butter, no meat, no oil. They give us a piece of horse meat. Who can eat horse meat? 

INTERVIEWER: If you had more coupons from working, could you buy more food? 

SUBJECT 2: We try to buy. 

SUBJECT 1: It was like a, she doesn't remember. Like a couple of things, you know? You go with the coupon, you get so much, let's say, eight ounces for the whole week. That's all. Don't you remember this, dear? 

SUBJECT 2: It's a lot of things I don't remember, really. 

SUBJECT 1: The coupons, you know, some of it was five ounces, five hundred, six ounces or eight ounces, you know? 

INTERVIEWER: Could you come back the next day and get it again, or no? 

SUBJECT 1: No. 

SUBJECT 2: If you used up-- 

SUBJECT 1: This is only for the whole week. 

INTERVIEWER: You mean they kept a record. 

SUBJECT 1: It was rationed. It was rationed. He give so much for the week, you know? 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm. So even if you worked-- even if you-- 

SUBJECT 1: Bread for the whole week. 

SUBJECT 2: That's all-- 

SUBJECT 1: That's all. 

INTERVIEWER: Even if you worked? 

SUBJECT 1: Even if you worked. If I worked-- yes, you know what I get-- a dinner in the factory. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. This I remember. 

SUBJECT 1: And I used to bring it home, you know, for the children, for my wife. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. And I remember we used to give up in the house, a little water and a potato was floating around. 

INTERVIEWER: What other memories do you have of the ghetto? 

SUBJECT 1: Cannot remember just one. 

SUBJECT 2: Of the ghetto, I got one memory that I'll never forget. In 1942, my father died. And there were so many deaths every day that they couldn't bury the people. So he was laying in a cemetery on the little house they have there for five or six days. 

And then-- you have to carry them to the grave, me and my mother and my brother. Got no people to bring him even to put him in the grave. This-- how can I forget this? 

INTERVIEWER: How did he die? 

SUBJECT 2: In sleep, from hunger. 

INTERVIEWER: From hunger? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: Hunger. 

SUBJECT 1: My-- my brother died in his sleep, too, from hunger. Hunger before he slept in my house, you know. And the next day when he woke up, he said I want to go home. 

He lived a couple of houses in the ghetto away from me. He went home. All of a sudden, I can't hear him, I don't see him. I went up there. That's all. 

INTERVIEWER: How old was he? 

SUBJECT 1: He was, by the time, he was 28, 29 years old. 

INTERVIEWER: He was a young boy? 

SUBJECT 1: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: And your father, Mrs. Stadtlender, how old was he? 

SUBJECT 2: 42-- ah-- 52. My mother was 42 when she died-- in a fire. I don't know. She was burned in the concentration Auschwitz. 

My father was 52. And we was not-- I told you. The food was so lack, that we never enough food. So he went to sleep. In the morning, we waked him up. So he was dead. 

INTERVIEWER: Are you sure that he died of hunger? Might not he have had a disease or an illness? 

SUBJECT 2: Nobody was sick there in the ghetto. Who can be sick? When I was eating potatoes, was laying six months underground with Clorox and all those things. And my mother made the pancakes, and I was eating. If I didn't get sick from that time, I'll never die. I think I'm going to live for a million years. You imagined the Germans-- remember [INAUDIBLE]? 

SUBJECT 1: I don't remember.
