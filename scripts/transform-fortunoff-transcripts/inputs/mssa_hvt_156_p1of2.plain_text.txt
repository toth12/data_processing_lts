LOIS J: That's was in the morning on before we-- after all the after school. Before we left the school, we were-- 

ABRAHAM J: When the business was. 

LOIS J: It was spring again. And near to our school was a big-- [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?]

ABRAHAM J: Yeah. 

LOIS J: And we was looking in the window. It was the school for us was maybe about a mile and a half. And we was looking every day in what kind of weather it was. We was walking to school. Not just we but from the around from the-- from the-- the farmers. They was leading about-- about three or four miles away. 

And they was coming every day, the kids. They was working. What kind of weather it should be? When we started school at 8 o'clock, that's was-- it was walking in-- in the dark time. And then in-- in '39-- 

INTERVIEWER: And the relationship between Jewish and Polish-- 

LOIS J: It was OK, yes. I got a lot of girlfriends not Jewish. The-- the-- the chief from police was he got a daughter. I was very good friends with her. She was in our house. And we was in-- in-- in their house-- very nice. And our town was very nice. 

Like in-- like the Jewish got Passover. We were sending present, matzo, wine to the Polish people, yes. And they know, we-- we kosher. We not to-- we don't eat the, like, not kosher food. They respect us for this, yes. 

And then '39-- 

INTERVIEWER: How old were you, then, in '39? 

LOIS J: I was born in '27. 

INTERVIEWER: So you were-- 

LOIS J: 12 years old, yes. In '39, started the war, the September 1. It's supposed to start school September 1. But the war started. And it was just two weeks. And then came to us the Russian. And when the Russian came, the-- all the kids-- like we was in seventh grade. 

They put us, again, in seventh grade because we didn't know the language. We was good students for two years. And then in '41 started the second war, June 22. Then the Russian-- the German came to us in-- in a week maybe. 

ABRAHAM J: Two weeks. 

LOIS J: Two weeks, yes. On-- in for this time, what did the the war started. The Russian army was going to Russia. To Russian they was walking day or night, day or night. And then the German came. It was a new law. The-- 

INTERVIEWER: Did the Russian is-- ask you to go with them? 

LOIS J: No, a lot of people want to go to Russia. But they says, everybody need some-- 

ABRAHAM J: Permit. 

LOIS J: --a permit. If not, they going-- they're not going to let you go in. But that what's wrong. If people would know that's nobody need nothing, a lot of people would go to the Russia because we know what the German do to the Jews. Then, uh, they split Poland in half because a lot of people Jewish-- bezhentsy 

Refugees came from the other side to us. They was in our town, too. All in the-- all of the-- the Stadtle. 

ABRAHAM J: The towns. 

LOIS J: Yes. They was from there. And this they told us what is going on there. And it was Jew-- uh, German people, too? Deutschen. Deutsche Juden. 

ABRAHAM J: Not too many. 

LOIS J: But they know what's-- 

ABRAHAM J: Yes. 

LOIS J: --started in-- in Germany. From beginning when the German came the first day, they took a couple of people just, you know, the oldest one to clean the street like work, like some this work. And they give them-- I remember my mother bring the first time a late, I don't know how you-- I don't know this in English. 

With a J, Jude. 

INTERVIEWER: The patch. 

LOIS J: Yes. The first one-- I remember this. 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe the moment what exactly? 

LOIS J: That was terrible in our house. 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

LOIS J: First of all, we not supposed to walk on the-- on the sidewalk. Jews doesn't-- doesn't have the right to walk on the sidewalk, not to go to the stores, nothing to buy. But we wasn't in the ghetto either way. That was two, three months after they put all the Jews-- 

INTERVIEWER: How did they let-- let you know about these laws? 

LOIS J: That was signs on the street. 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

LOIS J: And then-- 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe-- 

LOIS J: You know, every Jews understand a little bit German. 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

LOIS J: And one told-- tell the other one that's in five minutes everybody knows what is going on. And then they make, uh, like, um, a judenrat, from the oldest Jews. Like was, uh, a commandant, the-- the chief of the police, like Jewish police. 

If they need some workers in some places to send, they was coming to the houses because this was not telephones or something to-- to tell you. You need to come this and this time to go to work. On every day, they send us in another place. I was young. But I was started to work, too. 

Then was another law. To put this-- this same, the-- the that's what they give us, with the Jude-- Jews. We supposed to-- 

ABRAHAM J: A handband. 

LOIS J: Handbands 10 centimeter, you know, wide. 

ABRAHAM J: Two and 1/2 inches. 

LOIS J: With a little star Magen David But-- 

ABRAHAM J: The yellow Magen David. 

LOIS J: Yeah, not everybody, you know, was looking should be, you know, should look nice. You know how this was. It defined you. You don't have this on-- on the-- on your hand, they can kill you right away. 

There was another law that-- that was no good. Then they says, we need to make a yellow star in the front and in the back. I was a kid, you know. And I got such a nice-- made it. When we left the ghetto in '42, I took him with me, you know. 

You understand? I took the signs, you know, the yellow signs. It was so nice made it yellow and straight. I was a kid. I said, oh, no. I'm not going to leave him in the ghetto. I'm going to take it with me. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you feel about the star when you had to wear it? 

LOIS J: You know, what you can do? Just the first days was terrible. And then, you know, you, you know, you need to have this because when it was going to work every day, we was in-- in groups. How you say? 

ABRAHAM J: How many-- 

INTERVIEWER: In groups. 

LOIS J: In groups, yeah. We support-- we-- everybody got this for now, from the-- from the kids, from the Jewish. We was working for the-- first of all, we started to work in a place that was, um, camp for soldiers. Over there, for the that was from the Pol-- from the Polish army. 

They put us-- they took all the books, the Russian. Want to put this in fire. That was maybe for a couple weeks for burning the books. And then it was there a place what they got horses. We supposed to clean the places where the horses was there. 

Then they send us in another place to clean the floors, the windows. This was first time in my life I didn't know how to clean a window. But the German soldiers show us how with paper, with newspaper to clean it. 

It was there German, Lithuanian, Latician, Estoncy-es and-- 

ABRAHAM J: Ukrainian. 

LOIS J: --Ukrainian. But special nothing they didn't do to us when the time was-- we was walking with one German. It was such a-- such a terrible-- that's unbelievable. If somebody would see him for a mile, you know, was scared, terrible. 

One time, we was going home. And they put this all together before we left the place. And he says to a young guy. He says, you stole my watch today. And they beat him up. You know, the kid didn't have nothing. Nobody-- if would something special there, nobody was touching it. 

Then come some, um, a men from the-- from the Judenrat-- 

ABRAHAM J: And a Jewish representative. 

LOIS J: Yeah. And what kind of watches they give to him, he didn't want. But he didn't kill the kid then. When the-- the Jewish committee didn't send more, this guy over there to this place. In winter time, we was cleaning the snow. It was a winter. Maybe I don't know how many foot of snow. 

ABRAHAM J: Eight, eight foot snow more. 

LOIS J: We were standing outside all day long. 

ABRAHAM J: No food, no water. 

LOIS J: And we was cleaning the snow. What kind of food we got in the ghetto? We didn't have carts like in-- in the-- in the large-- in a big cities. In our city, we didn't have nothing. But the people, you know, the-- the--

LOIS J: Our ghetto was like-- I was born, I told you, in Dunilowicze. But in the ghetto, I wasn't there because and-- I forgot to tell this. In-- in 1940, in December, we left this town. And we was living in another place where-- because my sister was older when she got a job there. 

And we left our place. And we came to the other place. That was Postavy. That was about 25 miles.

And then when the German came, they was in police. And the-- the most intelligent girls, they put the worst work the worst work. My sister was blonde. And she got blue eyes. And she's-- 

ABRAHAM J: [INAUDIBLE] or Irish. 

LOIS J: No-- nobody can tell she is Jewish. And one time, she was walking. She never walked on the street, always on the sidewalk. And one time, the German saw her. And they something on the-- on the-- on the band, you know, and her hand. 

And they stopped the car. And they told her, if you-- one time more they going to see her on the sun-- on the sidewalk, they going to kill her. And one German soldier, he was not German. But he was Polish in the German army. He came to-- he-- he see it, a blonde girl. Maybe she is Polish. 

He says, I'm not going to go with the German to fight against the Russian. I'm-- I'm going to drop away from here. Maybe you can help me to find some clothes. But she says, I couldn't do nothing for you. I'm Jewish. I'm not Polish. But he didn't believe it. Nobody knows she's Jewish. 

Then we-- in the-- in the same-- 

INTERVIEWER: Do you member other contacts with Germans that you had with German soldiers or-- 

LOIS J: We was-- one time, we was-- 

INTERVIEWER: That you personally had. 

LOIS J: Yes. We was working in a place, in another place, not in the same-- with just German soldiers was there. It was one German. He was every day-- when he was walking-- he was opening the door from his schreibstube, from his office. That's in German, a schreibstube. 

He was saying, weiber raus, everybody should go out. 

ABRAHAM J: Away from here. 

LOIS J: And then he would-- and every day, you know, he was killing, um-- [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] 

ABRAHAM J: The beard, the black bird.

INTERVIEWER: Crow? 

ABRAHAM J: Yeah, the crow. 

LOIS J: Yeah. Every day when somebody from the girls, you know, supposed to clean it up. Nobody wants to do this. Every day-- on every day, the, you know, the cook was making for him-- it was, um, [? [GERMAN] ?] 

ABRAHAM J: [? [GERMAN] ?] 

LOIS J: Yeah. Was making for him this for supper. Every single day, he was eating just this. It was-- I remember one time they took all the soldiers. And they says, they're going to go to catch partisans. And we-- and we know already it's some partisans in the woods because when the Russian army left right away in the places, you know, some people from the officers, you know, to-- 

ABRAHAM J: They left them to organize. 

LOIS J: --to organize, you know, partisans. He says, I'm not going to go. We understand German. I didn't learn German. But it's, you know, need-- need to-- to Yiddish a little bit. On this, they-- he-- he took, um, a razor blade, you know. And he cut his self not to go. I think maybe he wasn't a German. That's supposed can be, too. 

And when we came back maybe about a couple months, he was working there. was cleaning the-- 

INTERVIEWER: He cut himself so that he wouldn't have. 

LOIS J: Yes, not to go, you know, maybe soldiers to catch the partisans. I don't know what-- 

ABRAHAM J: Fight, to fight the-- 

LOIS J: To fight, yeah. What happened, I-- we don't know because nobody told us. And it was two soldiers with me and another girl who was cleaning this rooms for a couple months. Every day, it was coming to work, would clean their rooms, a five, six rooms. 

And he asked me if I got stamps. And I-- I got a lot of stamps, you know, from-- from the old countries. I was bringing not all of them together. But sometimes a couple, he was giving me, you know, like marmalade, bread, something to eat when I was giving him the-- the stamps [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER: Did he talk to you about--

INTERVIEWER: --Jews, the war, anything? 

LOIS J: No, never, never. He didn't talk to us, no, no. 

INTERVIEWER: Did any German talk to you? 

LOIS J: Not to me, not to me, no. This was nothing. 

INTERVIEWER: And you wouldn't talk to German either? 

LOIS J: No. But I was afraid. You know, I-- I says every Jews understand German. But there's a lot of words. You know, it's-- it's means something different. Like the German-- it was one guy. And he was, um, a carpenter. And a carpenter in German is a tischler. 

But he didn't know. He'd think a stolarz is in Jewish. He wasn't thinking a stolarz is German, too. And a stolarz in German is, um-- [? [GERMAN] ?] 

ABRAHAM J: Thief. 

LOIS J: Yes. And the-- the guy ask him, ask a couple guys, what is your profession? What is your-- he says, I'm a stolarz Oy vey. He beat him up for this. What you mean, he says. But he didn't understand. He supposed to says, I'm a tischler, not a stolarz. 

And then they transfers another place to work. He was planting tobacco. That was for the army. That was not-- a German was working. We was not working for a German soldier. No that was um-- 

ABRAHAM J: [INAUDIBLE]. 

LOIS J: --from Poland. 

ABRAHAM J: No. 

LOIS J: A lot of Poland-- 

ABRAHAM J: They were the farmers. 

LOIS J: Yeah, they was farmers that they took into the army. And they was, you know, they-- 

ABRAHAM J: Plant. 

LOIS J: Yeah. 

ABRAHAM J: Plant tobacco for-- but they-- 

INTERVIEWER: The-- the overseers, the foreman. 

ABRAHAM J: Yeah. 

LOIS J: Yes. He was a foreman. But he was a nice guy. Never nothing happened. 

INTERVIEWER: Now when you describe it, you don't mention-- maybe it wasn't that Germans were so cruel. One person was beaten up. Another person but not [INAUDIBLE]. 

LOIS J: No, no. When the German came on the second day, they kill right away 11 or 13 people. I don't remember-- for nothing. Just somebody says, he was doing this. He was doing this. So they kill him right away. 

And then in our ghetto, where we was, they didn't took us, you know, to the-- like, in Germany, in the lagers. 

INTERVIEWER: Camps. 

ABRAHAM J: Concentration camps. 

LOIS J: Not in the camps. They kill altogether in one time. But it was a couple, you know, want-- in our ghetto, it was not just we but from the little towns like was in the small five families, six families. They're bring all together-- 

INTERVIEWER: And leaving the bigger one. 

LOIS J: Yes. And we was living in the house. It was four rooms and a kitchen. And it was about eight families together. But then where we was living, it was the ghetto. It was a small street. And near to them, another small street. We was living on a half from a big street. 

Our half was the ghetto but the other side not. And then in '42, that was about in May summertime. We started to build a high fence, maybe two meters. It was two meters? 

ABRAHAM J: Six foot, seven foot high. 

LOIS J: Yes, around the ghetto. And near to the-- to the end from the streets was the railroad. 

ABRAHAM J: On this-- one the river. 

LOIS J: On the river was there. And they built a large a big fence. And they made just one door, a little one to go out to walk and to came to work. And on the top from the fence, they put a wire, a special. 

But we left the ghetto. My-- my sister got friends. And they know already it's in the woods partisans. Exactly we didn't know. I don't remember if we got a radio or listening some news when we was in the ghetto. We didn't know. 

I don't know. Maybe some older people know. But I-- I didn't-- I didn't know nothing but this. And they-- before we left-- no, no, not this I want to tell you. With us together in the same house was living a sister-- a brother-- two brothers and a sister. 

There was a mother, too. But the mother was-- was away to look for her older son. And they says, the German catch him. And they kill on the way. But this older son was already in the partisans. When he came one night to take out the family. And then he tell us, it's a lie. Partisans in the woods. And so he was fighting-- they didn't fight this time with the Germans because they didn't have, you know, not the guns, not nothing. 

But they got, um, verbindung. 

INTERVIEWER: The connection. 

LOIS J: A connection, yeah, with Moscow. And then we took out this family. One guy left in the partisans. They didn't let him go. In-- on the other side to Russia, that was by a couple months, they was walking, you know, from the front line when there the-- 

ABRAHAM J: From German-Russian line. 

LOIS J: German and Russian line. 

ABRAHAM J: Over the front line.

INTERVIEWER: Well, did you hear any rumors about killing, about camps. What did you hear? 

LOIS J: Sure. We know-- 

INTERVIEWER: Who told you?

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any particular person who came? 

ABRAHAM J: [? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. ?] You remember-- 

LOIS J: Sure we remember. 

ABRAHAM J: [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?]

And came one guy [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] And he says, it's nothing. It's nothing. You just came, you know. Nothing is going to be-- go back to the houses. On this time, I suppose a friend of mine, my girlfriend, her father took the whole family. And they left the ghetto. She was thinking he was going to kill this ghetto too. 

We was-- we was thinking maybe now our ghetto not going to happen. Maybe here, not going to happen. Everybody don't want it to happen this. And he took the whole family. He got a lot of friends.

LOIS J: We know the-- the killing all the Jews, if the war is going to be longer, they're going to kill everybody. But we didn't have place where to go. 

If we-- you know how you can take-- everybody got a family, got kids, got all the people. Where you going to go? The Irish people don't want to let you in. What you going to do? We left the ghetto when the ghetto was still alive because I told you. My sister got--

LOIS J: In the ghetto, we didn't know for this, no. We know just in like in Vilna, that's a big ghetto. And they're killing a lot of people, like--

INTERVIEWER: What did you know about Ponary? 

LOIS J: About Ponary? We know they took out a lot people. And they killed them. They-- they-- that's all. We know this. But we didn't have place where to go. Where-- because then we left the ghetto. We didn't run away from the ghetto in time, in killing time. 

But we left in a regular day, night time. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm. We'll come back to that. 

LOIS J: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: --exactly. Could you-- 

LOIS J: No, I want to tell you just this. And then we left the ghetto. The ghetto was still alive. And we came to the woods over there. It was about 300 Jewish people. The woods, it was, you know, from-- from all the ghettos from around, from this place. 

When we saw them, we came out. You know, we got clothes. We was-- 

INTERVIEWER: Shoes. 

LOIS J: Shoes, everything. But how they was looking and this was winter time. When we saw them, how they look, no food, no nothing, we says, we're going to go back to ghetto. We're going to died on the place there because here is not a living. 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe them, how they looked? 

LOIS J: The people?

ABRAHAM J: [INAUDIBLE] the wood. 

LOIS J: No, no, it was day or night. It was just a fire. And everybody was-- 

ABRAHAM J: Close to the fire. 

LOIS J: Closer to the fire, you know, because it was cold. And then you sleep one night just in the clothes. And they was already for months. It wasn't water there. It was very bad with water in this place. And they was afraid to go, you know, to the farmers to ask for food or something, too. 

Everybody was black, you know, from the-- from the-- from the fire. The clothes was dirty. 

ABRAHAM J: Burning. 

LOIS J: The oldest one was the kids. It was a couple kids, too. They was crying. Not no food, no nothing. Then we look at them. When of the men came to us, we was about 20 people. He says, what do you crying? You want something to eat? Over there is potatoes. We can go and take. 

He didn't know what we crying. Because when we left the ghetto, you know, it was everything-- we were sleeping in our beds. And especially, now our ghetto wasn't so bad. But they kill a lot of people. In other places, they was taking out people. And they was killing. It was-- it was not every day. Some, two people. Some, one. 

From another ghettos, they says it's not legal because you came here or that you're not registered. Some people was afraid to go out because they came from another ghetto. And they didn't want it to register because they can send them in another place. And we said, we're going to go back to ghetto. 

INTERVIEWER: And did you return to the ghetto?

INTERVIEWER: Well, can you tell us-- begin. 

ABRAHAM J: My name is Abraham Jahelman. The Jewish name is Jahelman. 

LOIS J: [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] OK. 

ABRAHAM J: I'm born in 1921, December 23 in a little town, Hajduczok, about 120 kilometers from Vilna. In our town, like an old Jewish town with about two-- 1,200 Jewish people. And all together, we're about 2,000, with two Hebrew day schools-- one Hebrew day school, one Jewish. 

My father was a very Orthodox people. And our town, always with Orthodox. If it was not Orthodox, it was not in our town. Like an old Jewish old homes. It was four eh, shul with-- 

LOIS J: Synagogues. 

ABRAHAM J: --four synagogues. [INAUDIBLE] was a-- a Jewish bank to help people, to borrow money. Not-- now-- not for-- for the to pay interest. It's just for free. 

LOIS J: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]. 

ABRAHAM J: You need to pay for this. It was then was a Jewish bank. Actually was it for interested or interest to pay. But the people most-- mostly was business people. Part of one was-- what you call it? With the-- the horses taken [INAUDIBLE] what you call with the-- 

INTERVIEWER: Balegules. 

ABRAHAM J: What? 

INTERVIEWER: Balegules. 

LOIS J: Balegules. 

ABRAHAM J: Yeah, Balegules. 

INTERVIEWER: Horse and cab drivers. 

ABRAHAM J: I was a-- shoemakers was the tailors. And they came in here with [INAUDIBLE] All different kind of people was not too rich. Mostly, the people was, like you call in America now, it's poor. But in our time, like we called before, it was a middle class. 

Not too many-- come people-- like every Friday my-- my mom-- my mother was baking for-- for-- for Shabbos a little challah. She bring for a poor family challah or a piece of bread. 

INTERVIEWER: How many people in your family? 

ABRAHAM J: In my family, it was-- it was five brothers and a father and a mother. You know, family of mine in my father's family it was-- it was five brothers and two sisters. And all together, it was over 45 people. 

Now we are-- I am alive, too. I am in on a second cousin, on a-- on a [INAUDIBLE] with no [INAUDIBLE] When we started [INAUDIBLE], I go to the Jewish school. I finished sixth grade. Then I go to the Polish school. I finished seven grades. 

And then I started to work a little bit, you know, for very little. And this time, maybe for $5 a month American money. But it's worth enough for myself. You know, the-- the big-- when it started in 1930, there was the big-- 

INTERVIEWER: Depression. 

ABRAHAM J: Depression was in-- we was feeling where very very depression. My own father was very well, feeling very well. It was-- no-- lost everything-- business. But little by little, my father have a lot of-- he was a farmer a little bit with land. He was farming. 

My father-- my older brother, he was in the-- in the army, in the Polish army. On 1930-- 

INTERVIEWER: There are religious Jew in the Polish army? 

ABRAHAM J: Oh, yeah. 

LOIS J: Sure. 

ABRAHAM J: It doesn't matter. Everybody need to go to the army. You have right where you ask a rabbi. You have to eat. It's not kosher food. You need to eat. You have to eat. The rabbi said, the law Jewish-- the law says you have a right to eat not kosher food in the army. 

But it's a different kind-- what kind of food you have to eat, what kind not. But it was a lot of Jewish kitchens there. I was in kitchens to help out for Saturday, for holidays, for Passover, and so on. When I started, I was away in school in 1937-- my dental technician. 

When I finished after two years, I finished dental school. When I started to work, I'm a dental technician in the same little town. Started, you know, where the beginning was not too bad. But the beginning was not the bad and was bad. It was started the war. 

You know, like people mentioned already, the war was not too good for us and not good for nobody. When the Russian come to us, and I was started to work in-- the first one, the Russian put us out from this-- from the house where I was-- a house, a nice brick house. 

We have-- how many rooms we have? About six, seven rooms. I wasn't rich. Who can have six, seven rooms in this time? But my father was not to be-- not too rich. He built a new house. In 1931, he finished. The Russians take out [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] capitalist out. 

We was living in the-- in the-- in the temple out. But that was not bad. I was working. My brother was a bookkeeper. He'd come back from the army. He was in the front. He'd come back. My other brother was work in the hospital. 

Brother was passed away not too long, be a year ago in Israel. He was working [INAUDIBLE]. And I was working in the hospital as a dental technician. You know, it was not too good. But it was not bad. Then like I said, it started the war in 1941. 

INTERVIEWER: How old were you then? 

ABRAHAM J: I was, in this time-- 

LOIS J: 20 year? 

ABRAHAM J: For 20 years old. War started. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember about the start of the war? What were you doing on that day? 

ABRAHAM J: What was I doing this day in this day. When I-- when it started the war was a terrible thing. It was not so terrible when the war was started with German The Russ- the Polish with German, the Russian come to us. It was not so terrible. 

But we know already from before, when Hitler came in 1938, we read the pa-- newspapers before what had happened, what's going on there. And we know everything. We have friends of not Jewish people. [INAUDIBLE] says. The Jewish-- the Jewish have heard what happened. The war, it's-- the Jew make the war. They-- the American capitalist helped to build the war. 

And then they started. The war's coming on. Then the Lithuanians was-- we was in Lithuania already. They take over. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the entry of the German army, how they entered the town? 

ABRAHAM J: Oh, yeah. it-- it was-- 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe it? 

ABRAHAM J: Later on, OK. When the Russians started to move up, when the front went back to Russia, it's when the [INAUDIBLE] Lithuanian army was together with the Russian. They take over Lithuanian. To 1939, we was Polish. To 1941 was Russian. In 1940, when they take over Lithuania, the Russian, they give away-- our town was mostly Lithuanian people where I was living. 

And they give away to-- it was Lithuania. Than when the Russians started to move up, the Lithuanian in our town started to take guns. And the shoot the Russians when they started to move out. 

And I remember a Russian, one man, a colonel when he stopped to move. He says, in Russian, he says, [? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] ?] That's mean in English, help me, God, to come back to Lithuania. And pay them for this what he did to us. That was in 1941 at 25th-- when the war starting? 

LOIS J: 22, June 22. 

ABRAHAM J: The 25th of June. 

INTERVIEWER: And that was-- 

ABRAHAM J: Remember, this wasn't-- what-- what day was this? A Sunday? 

LOIS J: Monday. 

ABRAHAM J: It was on a-- it was on a Saturday of-- Saturday or Friday in 25th or 26th of June. That's was. And then we started-- we moved away from the little town. Then my father says, we're going to move to our other town. We have a horse. 

When we see the horse was not too good, we stopped. We can't move too fast. And he says to us, go. When I with two brothers who was away. Go to Russia. We work about 150 miles. When I [INAUDIBLE] knew what happened, we moved back. It was one brother, my youngest brother, was away. 

INTERVIEWER: Why did you turn back? 

ABRAHAM J: I don't know what it was happened. I don't know. Can't tell you. Something. Move back. OK, we move back. I met my older brother. When we come back-- 

INTERVIEWER: But you had to cross the front lines to move back. 

ABRAHAM J: No, it wasn't any front line. It was before the front line. It wasn't front line. It was where this was not-- it was no Russian there, no Germans. The Russian was behind me maybe about 200 miles of front. 

LOIS J: The German was behind you. 

ABRAHAM J: The Russian-- the Germans were behind me. They was moving on. And we was move to Russia. We come back. And the Germans was already in our town. I come back-- 

INTERVIEWER: So you had to cross. You went into Russian territory. You had to cross the line. 

ABRAHAM J: No, I wasn't in the Russian territory. The Russian territory was already-- they moved-- it was already no territory. The Russian at the front was always front line. Nobody moved. And the Germans bombed with the bombs and everything. But this was not-- so when I come back, when a friend of mine see me, I come back. They arrest me. 

INTERVIEWER: A friend of yours? 

ABRAHAM J: Yeah, a Lithuanian. They asked me. 

INTERVIEWER: How did you know him from before? 

ABRAHAM J: Oh, yes. We was together go a school friend, of mine a school friend. His name was Rakowski, a tall guy, blonde Lithuanian. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you do something together with him? 

ABRAHAM J: Never, never heard arguments with him. It was just school friends. He asked me, when he asked, do they arrest more Jewish people? And I remember on a Saturday night, 4 o'clock in the morning, they took us out-- three guys, two Jewish guys and one Russian in the same town. And they take us for five kilometers. 

And they shoot-- in this-- in this night, they kill about 25 Jewish guys from our town-- just Lithuanian. The Germans were the boss. But they was-- they was the-- the-- they take over. 

LOIS J: They was the helpers, you know. 

ABRAHAM J: They were the helpers. 

LOIS J: The German-- the German doesn't care. You can kill a Jew. 

ABRAHAM J: They come over. And they tell him, we're going to go to do something. Watch. What I see, we know the road where we go. But I was the youngest. I was 20 years old in 1941? Yes. 

But the other one-- one was 19. I was-- one was born in 1915, [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] The other one was [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] a Russian. He was maybe [INAUDIBLE] born he was maybe about 40 years old. We know all the way where to go, how to go. 

And they take us-- near there was a big lake. But the big from the lake was a kilometer and 1/2 the width. On the right side was a cemetery. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you think while going? 

ABRAHAM J: Going on the way, three us, quest for my house, for my father's house. And-- and that's a story. I need to believe it or not. But that's what's happened. And black and white cats move out the road. 

LOIS J: To cross the road. 

ABRAHAM J: Cross the road. In mine eyes was a big, like a story in mine eyes in the same moment. The cats read for me a story when I read it in my mind. I go and-- but they going to shoot me. They're going to shoot before going to shoot this man. They go-- go away from the left-hand side. I was in the middle. 

From the right side was [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] And I was in the middle. And that was the same thing what happened to cats reading for me when I was in the same thing. Before they kill, they shoot-- one was with the gun, with a handgun like the-- the police have what is this? 

INTERVIEWER: Revolver. 

ABRAHAM J: A revolver. And the one was was a bit-- 

INTERVIEWER: Can you-- you were walking on the road. 

ABRAHAM J: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: And what happened? It was not-- it was-- we come near the-- the-- little town, the farmer town. It was maybe about 25 houses there. 

LOIS J: [INAUDIBLE]. 

ABRAHAM J: I says, maybe can we ask for a drink water? He says, go ahead. We not was free. Now, when I understand now, but one from these guys says, why you don't plow down on them and then kill them? 

How would they kill you? They have a long-- they have a gun, a revolver. But it's right away you can shoot somebody. But it's nothing happened. We take water. It says, if you give you sticks, you're going to make holes. Well, we know already they're going to shoot us.

INTERVIEWER: Can you-- can you tell every detail? 

ABRAHAM J: We move, move. Then we [INAUDIBLE] the cemetery. The name from the town was Lazdin. On the-- the river, you call it Lazdina Lake. That's what you called the town, the lake. 

On the right-hand side was a cemetery and the same little farmer town. It was about 30, 40 families there, so maybe less. Well, my father have a land out there in the same place, in the same town. And he moved to the right near the cemetery. I says, here-- on here started a big woods. 

I said, here is the end. And I read in my mind what's going to be a minute or half a minute from now. Well, the cat says to me, from the left-hand side, they shoot before. It was one was the name was Kuczynski [INAUDIBLE]-- this was-- from the same town, if you come from the same town, Lazdin the other town was [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] 

And the third one, to me, was behind me was [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] All three was school friends with me. Then they shoot the other one.
