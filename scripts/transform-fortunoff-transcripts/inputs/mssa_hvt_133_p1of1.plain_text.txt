He said, my father said, I want for the children a better life than I had. And the children had no duties for me, nothing. If they will leave me if I will be old, this means that I put money good in a bank, and I have the interest. 

If they don't leave me, if I will be old and sick, I will go to the old age home. But he really was eight years sick. He bro-- he broke the hip here. He doesn't work-- he doesn't want to be in the-- you know, the-- the-- the treatment. 

So he was eight years in bed. And my brothers, they give and pay for everything. He's-- you see his attitude? He said, I have to give everything for the children. And I don't expect-- they have no responsibilities or duties. I-- I had the children, and this is my duty, to give them everything. And he gave everything, really.
