[TONE] SUBJECT: Not working, no. 

INTERVIEWER: No. 

SUBJECT: That's OK. No, OK. Never-- never mind. 

INTERVIEWER: There's more right here. 

SUBJECT: Huh? No, no, never mind. That doesn't matter. 

INTERVIEWER: I'm taking this one. If you have-- 

SUBJECT: Thank you. Enough. 

INTERVIEWER: --accounts of-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah? 

INTERVIEWER: --disappointments-- 

SUBJECT: Huh? 

INTERVIEWER: --you know, people that were friends and stopped being friends 

SUBJECT: I don't understand you. 

INTERVIEWER: People who were friends. 

SUBJECT: Yeah? 

INTERVIEWER: And stopped being friends. 

SUBJECT: Hm? 

INTERVIEWER: You mentioned Germans who helped. 

SUBJECT: No, is-- no. We did not have-- we did not have a relationship with anybody in this d-- in this place. We were all by ourself. 

Yeah, no. I had only-- as company, I had only my husband or the newspapers. Otherwise, I haven't got-- 

INTERVIEWER: OK. 

SUBJECT: Yeah, can? 

INTERVIEWER: Yeah, back to-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. So where I was. 

INTERVIEWER: You were at the doctor's. 

SUBJECT: Yeah, the doctor's. And he was so-- 

INTERVIEWER: The doctor? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, the doctor was so, you know-- so that is what our healer's can do to a person. But I help you. I'll help you. 

You see, and when he looked into the mouth-- so he gave him something. I don't know what and so what. And told him to-- but the police-- policemen and so on, for the beat my husband to go out during the day on the street. Because everybody would see that he was beaten up. 

So he had only the permission to go out in the evening when the door is dark, with a hat, very low about his-- his face. 

And he went to infirmary for many times, because he was very seriously hurt, and that is how it is. But as I later found out, the polices in Vienna, in Berlin, and so on, who has very many Jewish shops and businesses. So everything goes at once, at the same time, on the minute. It was smashed, and everything was rubbed out. You see? 

So that is-- that is what-- how that was. And when we went-- when my husband went through the-- through the [INAUDIBLE] you know, two Swedish corresp-- corresp-- 

INTERVIEWER: Correspondents. 

SUBJECT: Correspondents was there from a Swedish newspaper, and they saw it, everything. You know? And they put it-- when they went to Sweden, they put it in the newspaper. And that was very embarrassing to the-- to the mayor of the little town, and so on, and so forth. 

So they wanted-- that time, they wanted us to go out of the town because it was very embarrassing for them. And that was, you know, a certain time-- I don't remember how much-- till you-- we got the visa and we went out. 

And when, you know, we went out, went out in the morning. And-- and the-- and the evening before, the Gestapo called up my brother-in-law and ask where is my husband? So he smelled something-- something is not right. 

And he told him that he went away yesterday. 

INTERVIEWER: OK. 

SUBJECT: That saved him probably. They want to know if he is still there, they would take him off the train. You know? 

INTERVIEWER: And he left for the United States. 

SUBJECT: Hm? 

INTERVIEWER: He left for what country? 

SUBJECT: We went to Paris. And from Paris to-- to-- to America. 

INTERVIEWER: To America. Uh, have you been back to Germany since? 

SUBJECT: Hm? 

INTERVIEWER: Have you gone back to Germany since? 

SUBJECT: I don't-- 

INTERVIEWER: Have you been back to Germany? 

SUBJECT: I'll never in my life put my foot in Austria or in Germany. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you feel now about them? 

SUBJECT: I felt that I see the Jewish blood on the street. You know, I went once from New York to-- to Israel. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm. 

SUBJECT: And on the way, they-- they-- they were staying in some-- I don't know which-- which town that was in Germany. So I told the pilot, if I knew that you'll stop in Germany, I would not go with this plane. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you feel when the plane landed in Germany? Do you remember? 

SUBJECT: I felt that the Jews are, again, beaten up. And here, if somebody would give me a million dollar, I would not go to Germany or to Austria. 

I would not say that every German, every Austrian, is-- was a Nazi. I am not a Nazi to say that all Jews are-- are bad. There are good bad-- good Jews and bad Jews. But they told, you know, that I would never go back to the-- and I don't understand the people who went when they got the pensions, the German pension. 

INTERVIEWER: Tell me, why? Are you afraid? Are you not forgiving? What? 

SUBJECT: No. I don't want-- I don't want all this-- all the memories back. You know, when I came to New York-- 

INTERVIEWER: Yes. 

SUBJECT: --I told you that. You know, for-- for years, and years, I had the same dream. I'm running on this street. Whole-- no-- nobody inside. The street am empty. I am running around and I hear cries from all-- from all the windows, and-- and blaring radios. 

They took the Jews in jail, in the hotels, and beat them up. The people don't hear the cries they put on radios. And for years, I had such dreams in New York. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm. 

SUBJECT: And I was crying in my sleep. And my husband would wake me up and calm me down. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm. 

SUBJECT: You see, I did not went-- not to the concentration camp, but that was enough. And I can imagine what went through when you went to concentration camp. 

Unfortunately, my brother-in-law and my sister-in-law, they perished in concentration camp. You know, and later on, when the Nazis were defeated, this man that saved his life was arrested as a Nazi. And he was-- he was a officer. And put to-- put to trial. And his wife got-- got to my husband that-- that she should write a letter that-- to help him. So he wrote back. You know? 

I'll not write such letters. The Nazis read it, and beaten up enough Jews. And he did not write a letter. You know, and I was surprised when he did not sign the-- the form, that he gives everything away to the [INAUDIBLE]. 

When he did not write the letter, I was there. I was in America. I did not say a word. You know? But-- but I was surprised. I did not expect for him such courage because he was such a-- a kind person. You know? A shy person. That he has this-- this, you know, courage. 

Not to sign the paper when he knows that he is going to concentration camp. You see? I was surprised myself about his courage. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm. How has it changed you as a person? 

SUBJECT: Yeah? 

INTERVIEWER: How has this made you a different person? 

SUBJECT: Who, him? 

INTERVIEWER: No, you. 

SUBJECT: Me. You see, I h-- I'll-- I know for years, I had a terrible hate. But then I decided, my god. I am not a Nazi. And I cannot say that every German is bad, like the Nazi thought all Jews are thieves and murderers, I don't know what. 

So I knew many people who are very-- who were very nice. For instance, I know a case. I had a cousin. She was older, in Vienna, with a husband. You know, and they-- 

INTERVIEWER: I want to hear about you. How has it changed you? 

SUBJECT: Changed me. You know, I-- I try not to think about it. You see? I don't go to the-- I don't read the books about Holocaust. I don't go to such a movie. I don't, because when I start to read something about it, everything comes back. You know? And I cannot take it anymore. You see? 

For instance, I told y-- the couple of days that the eyes started, Dr. Moskowitz called me up. If so, I am not myself. Every time, when I-- that is, like, now it happens. This moment is happened. And I see my husband before me. 

SUBJECT: You see? That is it. If not for his code, I would never knew that he-- that is him. I recognize him by the code because he has a code of my husband, a person who he and me live together to 84 years. You see? 

So that is-- that is how I-- I have to [INAUDIBLE] this man that was before he [INAUDIBLE] or what is ever his name. He was that when he came in. He should not have talking about it because he has a pacemaker. He's a very sick man. You know? 

When I saw him, I-- I was afraid because I know him. You see? That is how we-- we react. If that is happens just now. You see? 

But I can't understand how people who went through that went back to live in Vienna. That is something that I can't understand. Good. The life is cheaper there, of their dollars, and so, so. But if I knew that I-- I almost died on starvation, I would not do it. 

And I know if that is what they want, of course, there were many people who risked their life to save a couple of the Jews. That is true. And I know such a case myself. 

My-- my-- you know, my cousin. He was engineer, and she w-- she w-- she was studying medicine. And they had a little girl. To save-- to save the child, they gave it to a Polish family. You know? And she was perhaps three years old, or something like that. 

After one year, she forgot about her parents, of course. They-- they had-- she had to be c-- coarse, you know, and heil Hitler. And so-- so-- so and they-- and they saved her. They told that is their daughter. You know? 

And they risk very much. Because it was a big crime. And when that was the Nazis were defeated and so on, so my-- he-- her husband perished in concentration camp. And she was saved how-- how, somehow. I don't know. She went to Paris. 

And when the Nazis went-- we are finished, so she went back to this Polish family and got the child. You see? And of course, when she came to Paris, she did not have anything. You know? And-- and then-- 

INTERVIEWER: OK, uh-- 

SUBJECT: And then-- I was here. We had very little, you know, because my husband was very sick when he came here. That is another story. You know? 

So she did not have anything, so I-- so I sent her all this-- my-- my clothes, and so on, and later on, when we started to-- to-- earn a living a little bit, so I sent her all this money because she did not have anything. 

And when she started to to make a living, she always sends this Polish-- Polish family money and packages. 

INTERVIEWER: OK. 

SUBJECT: You see? So there were this kind of people, too. And, you see, sometimes I hate for myself when I so-- I say-- anti-Semite. Not everybody's anti-Semite. You must not be so narrow-minded. You see, I hate myself for that. How was Hitler told it? 

And they say always, Hitler did not know about that. You see? That is how-- how it is-- how it is. So that is how I would never-- I would never go back to live to Vienna. I love the Vienna. Vienna is a beautiful city, you know? 

INTERVIEWER: It was. 

SUBJECT: But for me, is-- for me, is all the memories. 

INTERVIEWER: OK. I would like to thank you very much. 

SUBJECT: Thank you. 

INTERVIEWER: Thank you. 

SUBJECT: Yeah, I should have something that I-- that I-- I think that's enough. So-- so that is how it is. And I told before that story, too, I was here, in Yiddish [INAUDIBLE], you know? Where were you talking Yiddish? 

And we talk about Holocaust and that I was an American woman. So-- so I told her, so what do you think about Holocaust? 

I am American born. I cannot tell you anything. So I told you, you know? That is the trouble, you see? You are American people, that you don't know anything. 

INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE], 

SUBJECT: You see? 

INTERVIEWER: You are a-- a young woman. 

SUBJECT: Huh? 

INTERVIEWER: You have a youthful spirit. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Yes, I am useful. Regardless of-- 

INTERVIEWER: Youthful, youth. Young, young. 

SUBJECT: Hm? 

INTERVIEWER: Young. Youthful. 

SUBJECT: Yeah, that is what I say. Because I don't vary in-- I don't believe in the, how many years are you old? 

INTERVIEWER: That's right. 

SUBJECT: You see, I know people who's 40 years who are old. 

INTERVIEWER: Absolutely. 

SUBJECT: You see. That is that. OK. So I think you have enough of all this. 

INTERVIEWER: It's been a privilege to meet you. 

SUBJECT: Thank you.
