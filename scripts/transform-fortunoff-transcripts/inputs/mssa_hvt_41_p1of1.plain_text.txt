Then we went out in the like downtown. And the sick people-- was somebody sick and out, they walk around house by house and the shot down the people. If any is sick or something cannot go out, and he was hiding, either way, they shot him down. 

In outskirt the city, they surrender. The whole city was surrendered to Germans, Ukrainian, and the Polacks. Polish too, young boys surrender out.

Because the city was still not Judenrein complete from Jewish people. Then I work in the store. And this time, everybody got to wear the Star of David. In walks a Jewish woman-- a young Jewish woman says she forgot to wear the Star of David, and maybe the Polish people show us she's Jewish. 

A young Gestapo just ride in with a motorcycle, and go over straight to her. And he recognize her body, maybe somebody tell. He took out the gun. How many bullets he got, he cut her down. How many bullets? We took her this time of the cemetery to be buried. 

There was still few left in the city. And two weeks later, the Germans put down a law to take us in the complete number Jewish people in another town, to go in another town, like a little ghetto, they built. The name from the town was Jowacize

INTERVIEWER: How did you find out that your sisters and your brother were alive? 

SUBJECT: Alive in Germany when the war ended. Some boy come at this time from Poland. Because when the war ended, was free passage for prisoners who want to go back in the land where they're born. Was free trains. 

And other Jews who was liberated from different parts, they started to come in the American zone. Because was more freedom. And a boy I meet, he tell me he saw in Poland, my two sisters and my brother. They live now in Sweden, Stockholm. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you ever go back to the little town where you came from?

And when somebody can wipe off, he was caught, they shot him other way. They used to do with a pen. The pen, the point of from the pen is ink, and it goes into the skin.

INTERVIEWER: But you said sometimes it would wear off, it would rub off? 

SUBJECT: If it was right away. Maybe it can wipe right away when they did it. If it was lost, they shot the person right away when he do this. 

INTERVIEWER: If he tried to rub it off? 

SUBJECT: And that's it, sure. There was so many laws. What they did it, the Germans, complete to wipe up. In the camps, every day, different selections. Selections to keep just to kill people camp again. That's all.

INTERVIEWER: The question, what do you feel now when you look at that tattoo? 

SUBJECT: How I look? What you can-- how you feel? What you can do when you got to go on, and we got to try to show for the world to never forget about this. The same like I saw two weeks ago, I read the article in paper. 

And from Poland in a small town. And it's before that the deportations started against the Jewish people, there was a big rabbi in the city. And he say one thing first before he hear what's happened town by town, city to city, the Germans wipe off, he take off the scores from the Torah to be buried of the cemetery. If somebody survived to tell generation, generation what they did to the Jews. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you notice that number on your arm every day, or do you not notice it anymore?

INTERVIEWER: What do you think now about everything that happened to you? 

SUBJECT: What I think about-- well, you got to go on, the life like always. What you can do about? Nothing. We can do none about. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you tell your children? 

SUBJECT: The children, I tell them about them. I tell them. I got two sons. One is in law school. He study to be a lawyer. Then other one work. 

INTERVIEWER: And what do you tell them about what happened? 

SUBJECT: I tell. They know about it, where I passed by in the camps. They know. 

INTERVIEWER: Did they discuss it with you? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, the older one is a college graduate. He knows. And he wrote-- he read the book. He was read the book about the Holocaust. Read about the Holocaust. 

INTERVIEWER: Is there anything else you want to tell us, Mr. Macars? 

SUBJECT: No, that's all. Let's see, to survive, there was the nature of in a person too. I mean, sometime, a person cannot. In my town, when we was first in the camps, there was electrical wires around the camp, high-voltage wires. It can kill a person. 

There was two brothers from a very orthodox Jewish family, they come. One went to the wires and did suicide. Another one hanged himself. He cannot go on to live, alive like this. Another hanged himself. I know did it at all. The two of them, that's why they cannot go on with life. That's the way it is. 

INTERVIEWER: It's against the Jewish religion to-- 

SUBJECT: To do suicide. And what they do, they cannot take it. Starvation and disease and everything, they cannot take it alive. 

INTERVIEWER: Did older people suffer more than younger people? 

SUBJECT: Older people was not too many. Not too many older people. Most of the older people, with selections, they killed them. In another force with us from the same town was two little boys, two little boys and a father. So in a nice family, and then we come of Plaszów, they shot him. And no other family, they shot him, the Germans. 

INTERVIEWER: You saw it? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, the Germans, yeah. Of course, it was ever day, selections. Selections, and so they stand up the people, and like ranks them. They started to count them. What, what, I don't know what. The big shot, the big officers, every day, day after day, selections to kill slaughter people. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember what you were thinking during the selections? What would you think? 

SUBJECT: What you can think? So nothing to think about. It was-- what you think? You can ask a question by God. Why we got to suffer so much? There was no answer to it. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you ever try to talk to any of the guards or any of the people that were in charge? 

SUBJECT: What you can talk? They-- it was nothing to talk to them. There was brutality. They was trained to brutality. They cannot. Some of them, when they walk with the machine guns like this, they came at-- when they come, the guards, the SS with the death symbols, of the hat, they were sway, they cannot face a Jew face. The brutality, they call us names. They call bandit. We are the bandits. The Jews are the bandits. Names, brutality, names. 

INTERVIEWER: They used to call you names? 

SUBJECT: Names. Like we wanted the war, or we wanted the bandits, ah! 

INTERVIEWER: No one ever tried to talk to them? 

SUBJECT: No, you cannot talk to them. 

INTERVIEWER: What would happen if someone tried? 

SUBJECT: When someone tried to-- what you can talk? It was nothing to talk to-- 

INTERVIEWER: Did anyone plead with them? 

SUBJECT: No, never, never. There was brutality. 

INTERVIEWER: Did anyone say, please don't shoot me, please don't hurt me? 

SUBJECT: Was help, was no help, nothing. But they-- but then to shoot a Jew-- but the old Germans was like, in our religion, it was like a good deal, you doing something. They call a mitzvah. You do something for somebody good. I recall-- I forgot. 

Then the same for them was to kill a Jew. That's how it was. There was-- they trained for it. They was trained for years just to wipe off completely, Jewish people. That's how it was with them. 

INTERVIEWER: They used to say that? 

SUBJECT: Sure. They-- there was posts where, they took out children from the mothers, when not they shot the mothers straight by the deportation. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you see that? 

SUBJECT: I see that, but I know about this. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you see anything like that? 

SUBJECT: In the ghetto, I see it many times. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you see? 

SUBJECT: In the ghetto when they shot down people, plenty, in Kraków. When the camp was in the ghetto, there some time-- we was young boys, sometime when the Germans don't fight you so close. We used to sneak out in the ghetto. Why we went in the ghetto? Because maybe we find some food bread, bread, bread, bread. 

Then sometime, the Gestapo arrived at the ghetto, they shot down people. And we sneak out back from the ghetto back in the camp. Not we sneak out to the wires where the ghetto was, and the people, starve alone. But sometimes, they give us something to eat. They threw sometime a slice bread. 

INTERVIEWER: They threw you a slice of bread? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Over the fence? 

SUBJECT: Over the fence. Wires, was, yeah. It was not electrical wires, was just wires there. You got to watch out where they got them watching close. 

INTERVIEWER: Who would throw it?

INTERVIEWER: The ghetto? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, they give us sometime. 

INTERVIEWER: What's the difference between the SS and the Gestapo?

Who pick up? They pick up a selection. Who pick up? They pick up. 10 of them was hanging, like I saw a picture. I saw this a lot. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you mean, hanging? 

SUBJECT: They hang them. 

INTERVIEWER: But you said with their hands-- 

SUBJECT: With the hands like this against the pole, just by the hand on big poles. 

INTERVIEWER: They hung them by the hands? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Did they die that way? 

SUBJECT: They die. How long you can survive like this? Sure. 

INTERVIEWER: Did some survive? 

SUBJECT: I don't think so, no. No. 

INTERVIEWER: What else did you see? 

SUBJECT: In the can camp where I was in Kraków, another one time was where the people they took to work, there was between three Jewish girls still. Most the group, hundreds of people, went out to work. 

One time after-- in the barracks was a fire in night time. And they say the Germans, the obersturmfúhrer come, and he say sabotage and the Jewish people did it. And the second day, they took out the whole group what they work in the barracks, 10 people shot down. I saw this a lot. Walk out in the morning to take us out to work, they lie and go over there. 

INTERVIEWER: They left them lying there? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. To see, for the people. 

INTERVIEWER: They wanted you to see? 

SUBJECT: When we went out to work, we see that. 

INTERVIEWER: They left them there-- 

SUBJECT: They left them, then after they dig up from the back barracks, a big hole and they put them there. What they could do? They go look for a cemetery? They just put in the back barracks. When somebody die, they put in the back barrack. In the back from the barracks, in the back. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you see any children? What happened to children? 

SUBJECT: The children, I don't see. They used to come in the ghetto. When I was in Kraków, I hear they used to come catch up children day after day, just catch them up. And they load them of trains, of trucks. And the trucks was gas and they gas them. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you mean, catch them? 

SUBJECT: In the ghetto, they used to catch them up in the ghetto. They hunt them down. 

INTERVIEWER: They hunted down the children?

INTERVIEWER: You saw this? 

SUBJECT: This I don't saw this, but I hear about this. Is true. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you ever see them catch a child? 

SUBJECT: One time when we work in the street, break up houses in Kraków, then I saw it. A truck passed by, and the Germans killed a few children. One boy, a small little boy, was 10,11 years, he jump out from the Jeep, and he jumped to us where we was working. And the Germans chase him after, but they didn't catch him. We took him later in the camp. We took him in the camps. 

INTERVIEWER: You saved him? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, we save him. But he was with us later in the camps, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Did he-- 

SUBJECT: Where they took, the Germans, the children to be slaughtered. 

INTERVIEWER: Did the boy you saved survive? 

SUBJECT: I don't know if he survived the war. This was in 1940-41. I don't know if he survived later on. But this time, we were saying we were safe. 

INTERVIEWER: You were-- 

SUBJECT: And they chase after. I saw the Germans run around with the guns, and look around all over. But they don't catch him, he hiding. When he went of us to the construction where we work in the houses, what we clean up, our big street houses. 

Why we clean up the houses in this time? The Germans build. They want to build a railroad track of the Russian front in 1941. That's what we built the tracks. The ulterior was when they took us out to work to clean the houses, break up houses. 

INTERVIEWER: Demolish the houses? 

SUBJECT: Demolish, demolish, yeah. Construction demolish. 

INTERVIEWER: And you hid this boy where? 

SUBJECT: He was hidden by us, but the cons-- it was a big place, where the houses was. And when they went away with the Jeep, we took him in the camp. And how does he survive? I don't know later on, because was a lot of years later to go. Later they send us out from this camp anyway. 

In 1944, Plaszów was no more existed, they say. The Germans left the place, because the Russian army started to come close. They left, the Germans, whole place. But they did it with the people. I hear about later on. When they shot down people, they dig up. They put down gasoline, they burn up old bones. Yeah, that's all. 

INTERVIEWER: The boy that you saved, did you talk to him? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, I talked to him. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you speak with him? What did he say? 

SUBJECT: What do you say? They was catched in the ghetto in Kraków. 

INTERVIEWER: Did he cry? Did he talk about it?

INTERVIEWER: Did he ask you to help him? 

SUBJECT: We tried to help him. He knows we work in this street, and we took him in the camp. 

INTERVIEWER: Did he talk about his parents? 

SUBJECT: He talk about the parents. I think he talk about the parents, about where, what, the parents. In the ghetto, every day was selections. Every day, actions. Every day, they used to come together. 

In the end, in the ghetto, they took old people from Plaszow massacred the whole ghetto. The whole ghetto, wipe off. Whole ghetto. Old people. 30,000 people, one place, they massacred. They was death from the ghetto in Kraków. 

INTERVIEWER: What else do you remember? 

SUBJECT: That's all, I think. But to be a Jew was very hard to survive. Like a Jew was to be slaughtered a hunted animal. Was nothing. When you don't got the Germans, you got the Polish population. You got the Ukrainian. Who you go to fight first? 

INTERVIEWER: Do you believe in God? 

SUBJECT: You've got to believe it. You've got-- that's a question. You got to believe it. That to go on and on, on, and no answer to it.
