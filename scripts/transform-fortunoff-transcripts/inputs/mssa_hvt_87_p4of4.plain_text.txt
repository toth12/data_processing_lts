INTERVIEWER 3: Do you remember, during this time, did you have any dreams of any sort-- good or bad? 

SUBJECT: No dreams at all in the-- at the time, but afterwards. I think, since I am in Israel, that came over. Ugh, I was running away-- all the time I run away. 

And the vision of ghetto-- um, the vision of ghetto of Warsaw, uh, together with the-- with the ghetto of Bochnia, it was-- 

INTERVIEWER 3: Mixed.

INTERVIEWER 3: Smoke. 

SUBJECT: Smoke. We saw it from the train when we were um-- now. Nu, nasanu be... We were passing by train. It was along the-- along the wall of the ghetto. From the street, you couldn't see anything. But when you were-- when you were in the train, it was-- you were higher. And you could see the buildings were שרוף. 

INTERVIEWER 3: Burnt. 

SUBJECT: Burnt. And nobody was there. And I saw the people of the-- of the deportation in the-- in the ghetto of Warsaw. 

And I don't remember. But I was in the deportation. I was out the deportation. I was mixed with them. Months after months, I saw these films. 

INTERVIEWER 2: In your dreams?

INTERVIEWER 2: Were you afraid of losing your glasses? 

SUBJECT: Now? 

INTERVIEWER 2: No. Then. 

SUBJECT: Ah, then. Of course. With the glasses, it was-- it was a terrible thing. But you know, when you-- when I-- when I went the street along, and I wanted to see somebody from afar-- the-- the danger from afar-- because there were peoples I knew. For instance, in Warsaw, there were many policemen who I was afraid of them. For they knew that I am Jewish. 

I wanted to see them from afar. Without glasses, I didn't saw them. I didn't see them. So I-- as-- as I have-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah, sure.

INTERVIEWER 3: --that was nice. 

SUBJECT: In this times, I thought only of one thing. I was not sure that I will overcome. But if, I was sure that I go to the woods. I didn't want to see people anymore. I hate people. 

At this time, I was sure that if I go through to war, I will go to jungle to live together with animals. But it changed. You see I am here. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you feel good about yourself now that you were strong and were able to make it? 

SUBJECT: I feel I-- I just don't know how I managed it. I don't know how I managed it, all this-- what-- what is behind. Sometimes, I think about whether I could do it-- do these things, which I have done-- once again. Impossible. 

To be aware of all the time, to answer answers that I don't know where from they came on the spot. For instance, I was-- when I came to the-- to my first flat, I had to registered-- to register in the-- at the-- [SNAPS FINGERS] no. [? [OTHER LANGUAGE, NOT HEBREW]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 2: Concierge? 

SUBJECT: Yes. Concierge. And I had forgotten my name. I gave him my-- my passport, and I forgot my name. No. Black. 

And it took me seconds, and it was a year. I-- I asked him, what do you ask? And once more, as if to-- to-- to make sure whether he wants to. The passport was by him, yes? He-- he has it-- he hold it in his hands. And-- and I didn't see. And I didn't know what is my name. 

And it came, but I'm sure that he-- uh, he-- he knew that I am-- that is not my name, for it took me too long.
