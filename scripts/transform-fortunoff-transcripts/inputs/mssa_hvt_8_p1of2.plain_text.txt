LAUREL VLOCK: It's so much pleasant in here now, windows. 

CREW: A lot better. OK, whenever you're ready. 

LAUREL VLOCK: You just tell me when and I'll-- I want you to just give your full name and where you were born, the city, the town, whatever it was. 

STANLEY SWIMMER: Start now? 

CREW: OK, yeah. 

STANLEY SWIMMER: Eh, yeah, I'm Stan Swimmer, Stanley Swimmer. And I was born May-- May 10, 1931 in Sosnowiec, Poland, which is known as Upper Silesia in English and Oberschlesian in German and Slonsk in Polish. And that's-- we're about 15, 20 miles away from the German border. One day it's Poland, and nex-- one day it's Germany and and those situations. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What was your family like, uh? 

STANLEY SWIMMER: Well, we, uh, Let me get composed a minute. Well, we, uh, were five children, all together, you know? Uh, three sisters and two brothers. Father and mother, we had grandparents that did not live in the same city that we did. Uh, we had a lot of cousins. Uh, we weren't rich but we weren't poor. And, uh-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: What did you do with your friends? Did you go to cheder? Or did you-- 

STANLEY SWIMMER: I went to cheder for uh-- let me just-- basically we lived in a community that was 95% non-Jewish. And, uh, we spoke Yiddish at home. Uh, I know a little lid-- yiddish now, but mainly we spoke Polish. And uh, up until 1939, I'm 48 now. I never knew what it meant to be a Jew. [INAUDIBLE] I-- I'll get-- I'll get composed in a minute. 

LAUREL VLOCK: That's all right. 

STANLEY SWIMMER: Thank you. 

LAUREL VLOCK: That's all right. 

STANLEY SWIMMER: And uh, basically, uh, I-- I would compare it because, I, you know, I was young enough when I came here to compare it to a Jewish boy of my age, at age 8 or 9, in New Haven. Where, you know, you were Jewish, you knew you were Jewish. But yet, you were American first. And that-- that what I would compare it to.

LAUREL VLOCK: Let's talk about after the war, that you were afraid to tell. 

CREW: OK, go ahead. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Go ahead. 

STANLEY SWIMMER: Well, right after I was liberated by the Americans, and, as I say, I traveled with them throughout Europe, it was quite a while, eh, before I got myself to admitting being-- of being Jewish. At that point, I did not know that the Americans were for the Jews, against the Jews, or in between. I-- I didn't reali-- you know, I thought that the whole world was really against us. 

And, uh, one day, uh, the way it happens, one day I, uh, saw an officer, an American officer, and he had the insignia of the commandments. And I asked one of the GIs, I said, what is that? He says, well, he's a Jewish chaplain. And that's when I finally said, gee, they can't be that bad. They have Jewish chaplains in the ser-- in the-- in-- in this army, you know? 

And that was quite awhile now we note the the nightmares almost. Many times they're-- my wife would wake me up and says, what's the matter? What's the matter? I said, just had had a bad dream, that's all. Go back to sleep. That's it.
