SYLVIA BRODACH: My name is Sylvia Brodach. 

INTERVIEWER 2: No, we're certainly rolling. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Oh, we're rolling? 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Are we going to shoot it again? Oh, we're rolling. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Hi, my name is Sylvia Brodach. My maiden name is Kaplowitz. I was born in Czechoslovakia, in the town called Velky Berezny. It's part of Czechoslovakia. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What year? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: 1928. And it's part of the-- it's called the Carpathian Mountains. It's uh, not really a small town. 

We had surrounding smaller communities. It was sort of like, uh, I don't know the exact population number. But it was considered a big town. 

We lived in our own home. I come from a family of six children. My parents and my mother's mother, and my grandmother, we were all living together. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And I was the oldest. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah. She was the oldest. In between us, there was our brother, Chaim. 

And after me, my mother had twins. But one of them died. Her name was Freda. 

And then it was Judith. And I had a little brother, Yankov. We were six children all together. And out of the six, there are only two of us left. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: Then we lived in a house-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Name? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: My name is Frances Goldstein-Kaplowitz And I'm the oldest from the six. And this my sister. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Born? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And born in December the 7th, 1924, in Velky Berezny. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Czechoslovakia? 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: That was Czechoslovakia. And that was sort of an okres of the Carpathian. We had a population of like, 75% of Jews lived there. And we were brought up under the Republic of Tomas Garrigue Masaryk 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Masaryk. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And we lived a very happy life. We-- my father was a businessman. And we were educated in Czech. And in Yiddish, we had the Yeshiva in the town that we supported. 

We had three synagogues. And we were living, there, a happy life, till the age-- I remember, I was about 17 in 1938, when the Germans occupied the Sudeten. And all the Czech had moved away from the Carpathian back deep, to Czechoslovakia. And the Ukraine came over. Remember? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And then when we living in Czechoslovakia, we had a very democratic country. We never experienced any anti-Semitism under the Czech government. We associated. 

My friends were Czech, you know? And like, after the war, we heard that all these different European countries, they had experienced anti-Semitism, which I really can't say that we did. We-- Czechoslovakia was considered one of the-- a second to America, the most democratic country, in all of Europe. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, that's true. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And uh, so we had a very happy home life. My father was-- our father was in-- well, I was a kid, so I wouldn't know exactly. But a very comfortable life. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It was nice. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: He had a good business. And as a matter of fact, in the-- in the '30s, one of our cousins, my uncle, that was living here, in the United States, came to visit us. It was in 1935, '36. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, that was in '35. And then in '37-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That was my mother's brothers, that he wish to come and visit us. And at that time, he made arrangements to take some of his chil-- uh, sister's children to come to United States. But my father, that was it, he wanted to take her out. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And my grandmother, we were living with my grandmother. My mother was the youngest in her family. And you know, it was customary, the youngest was married, with the parents. So we were brought up with a grandmother. And my uncle, who was the one, already, in America, that my sister just referred to, he made papers, me to take out, and I should go with my grandmother. 

And my father, I remember like today, he said, he didn't have any kids, that they should wander around in the world. So of course, he didn't let me go out. And we got stuck. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Well, you know, that it's sort of that-- why should he let his child go away? What is life, if not having his own kids with him? He didn't see it. 

And he had no need to send his child away. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Your uncle thought that the Germans, or-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No, I don't think he felt. He just-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: At that time, there was no Germans. There was still peace. Who knew it? Nobody knew what's coming. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah, we didn't know what's going to be happening. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: If we would have known what's waiting for us, then we would have saved our whole Family. My father had, here, two brothers in America too, and a sister too. We would have done everything possible. But who knew, what's coming, what's waiting for us? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We had-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We lived in a happy home. My father was a successful businessman. We were happy children. 

We had everything. We-- we didn't know what was waiting of us. The year 1937, when my second-- the second uncle came to visit, and when he returned, the war broke out when he was on the ocean. When the Germans occupied the Sudeten, then it began. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: When Chamberlain made a deal over Czechoslovakia. So part of Czechoslovakia, the Germans occupied. And the Carpathian part that we were, the Hungarians occupied. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: The-- at that time, you remember, the Czech, they'd went back home. They took orders and they went home, like, called mamaland, means their own country. Because that part was always unstable, with the government. It was always switching. 20 years with this, and then it was-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: 20 years, and then there's Hungarian, and 20 years under the Czechoslovakian. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: So they went all back to Czechoslovakia. And I remember, I was a kid and I was a big patriot. I was a Czechoslovakian. 

And the Czech was already on the train, all went back home. And all of a sudden, somebody told my father that I was on the train too, that I wanted to leave all my family and go with them. I felt I belonged with the Czech people. 

And then my father came and hardly dragged me down to the train-- from the train. And I came home, and I see my father is making a Hungarian-- um-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Flag. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Flag. And I was-- because we were taught in school, you know, that Hungaria was the enemy for us. And here my father is, making a Hungarian flag. And I got so upset, and I will tear up the flag, you know? 

And he says, oh my child, you could make me in trouble, you know? And here, I didn't know one word English, I mean, Hungarian, nothing. And I was felt like, I don't belong here. I-- I was very depressed. And then the Hungarian came in. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And they occupied our section of Czechoslovakia. And we had to start learning a new language. We went to school. And that's when they-- we started to learn the-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And I-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --the Hungarian language. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Remember? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And we were-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And I refused to go to the school. And I never did go to the Hungarian school. I couldn't accept that from now on, I have to learn a language that I was taught, that it's mine enemy. 

So I-- I refused to go to school. My sister and my brother after me, I was the oldest, and they went to school. And I was just being home and helping out in home. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And that's when our problems started to-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: That was in 19-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --unfold. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --40. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: 30-- '39. 1939. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But your uncle came from the United States in 1935. '35? '30s. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Why would he even suggest-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: You see, he used to come and visit us. His mother, my grandmother, was living there. And he, every few years, when there were two brothers, used to make the journey to Europe, to visit his mother and his sisters and brothers. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But did he sense a threat, that he wanted to take-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. You see, some of our aunts, his sisters, they were financially sort of, uh, having a hard time. So he thought that by helping out, he would bring each child, one child, from different families all to United States. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: Because in Europe, it was always customary that family tie was very close. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Very close. 

BOTH (IN UNISON): One helped out the other. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It doesn't matter where. If you had a little bit more-- I mean, nobody was rich. If you had a little bit more, than you will share, your sisters, your brothers or sister. You know, we'd been taught that way, to share. 

So when my uncle came out and uh, came visiting, as then, you know, like, his sister cried to him, you know, look, the way it is, we cannot make it. So he took out one child. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: He took two-- two children there. And the third one was supposed to be my sister. But my father wouldn't let her go. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And that's how. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And you know, they came here to America, that was in 1939, exactly before the war broke out in Europe, they already came here. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No, it was earlier, 1937, '38? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Before the war broke out. Yes. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Just before-- before the war broke out. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Before the war broke out, the Germans were in Czechoslovakia with the Sudeten. And they occupied the Sudeten. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And that's when, really, our problems started. But compared to what went on other places, we were still in our home. The only hardship we started to feel was that they took the business away. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: That was-- remember when the Hungarian came. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The Hungarians came in from Hungary. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But before the Hungarians came in, we had the Ukrainian, the so-called Ukraine. The Sichaki, they came in. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But they didn't stay too long. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And they didn't stay too long. They were there, maybe, about three, four months as well. Just, they wanted to take over that government. You know? And they weren't successful. And then right after that, the Hungarian army came in. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And they occupied-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And they occupied the Carpathian. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And one day, they brought families, Hungarian families from all of mother-- you know, [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah, but you - yes. But that remember, it was in Hungaria. They had plenty poor people, you know? So the Hungarian government, you know, promised them-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They re-- uh-- located the people. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: To bring over there is Jewish property, Jewish everything. And they brought like, deep from Hungaria, Budapest, you know, they bring-- brought over the poorest people, that they couldn't make a living-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened to you? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To us, when my father, our father, had a big store. He had uh, yarn goods, tailoring. He had quite a few people working for him. So they took our business away. They-- they just walked in and took over, literally, without any questions asked. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They took the keys to the store. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And then they moved in. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but remember, Sylvie, that they were-- when they brought in all those poor Hungarian in, so they marched through the city first, looking around, you know? What is what? What is what? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Which store is-- um, that they liked best. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And they chose everything, whatever was appealing to them, they just plain-brain came in and then took over. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They occupied it. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And they told you, "get out," and that was it. So my father had to get out. And-- and we-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And he-- he had it in-- and see, in Europe, the housing, the way it was located is, in the front, we had a big house. You know, it's like, two-family house. And it had two big stores in the front. 

One store was occupied by my father. And the other one, he rented out. So the place that he rented out, the Hungarians threw out the Jewish family that owned-- owned it. They had a grocery. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And the one that we had, they took over. But they didn't have a tailor; they opened it up as yard goods, some buttons and thread. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They only took Jewish 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Only Jewish. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Only Jewish business. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: All the Jewish businesses in town. When they marched through, they took each and every Jewish business over. Regardless if this was a grocery or a tailoring, or shoe repairing, or a-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Grocery. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Galantary [haberdashery] that they had every shoe store, everybody put themselves-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Every Jewish busi-- owned-- Jewish business, you know, owned by Jews, they took, after that. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Well, what did you think, because you said there had been no anti-Semitism in your town? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But you see, our local people didn't do that. It's just the-- the ones who occupied the country. They brought them in from-- they called their uh, motherland. Hungarian. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They brought all the poor people, all their people from Hungaria. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From Hungary. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Back into our country, that they occupied. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. What was it-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They moved in. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes. What happened? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They moved in. And they-- well, they just took away the business. And they ran it themselves. And my father, our father, took as much as the stock that he could, his machines and things out, and bring, that we lived right in back of the store. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Wait a minute. So he didn't took out-- they only give him one machine. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: One machine. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: One machine, they told him that he can take out with him. And then-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: For his personal use. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: For his personal use. Because he said, listen, I have six children. You know, I mean, I have to do things for them. So they allowed him one machine. 

So he took one machine in the back. In the front was two stores. Ours, one was a grocery with a tenant. In the back of our store was a villa. We had 2 and 1/2 rooms, a kitchen and two rooms. 

Now, we were allowed-- my father was allowed, because he had six children, they allowed him one machine to take over. And the other one was thrown out, with apartment. That family had to get out. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Had to move on. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And the Hungarian took over the grocery. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They came in with a family. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Of course, he moved in with his family. We were only allowed to stay in our-- in our house, in the 2 and 1/2 rooms. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Living quarters. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In the living quarters. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: In the living quarters. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And my father took, that time, the machine. And we were starting to struggle. You know things got bad. We didn't have-- and all the people that lived with us, in a way, kind of supported us. 

Means that he-- my father should make him a coat or something. But it was always in black, that no one-- nobody had to know about it. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Some of the government people. Who ran the government? The Hungarians themselves. If they wanted a coat or a suit-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In the night. In the night. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --secretly, used to come into our house, because my father was very well known in the community as one of the best tailoring and [INAUDIBLE]. And then when they needed uniforms, the Jaeger, and their clothing. So they used to come into our home, in the back-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Well, wait a minute, Sylvia. They didn't come into our house. They used to call my-- you know, give a-- send somebody. 

Europe was always, you send somebody over and you wouldn't come there. He was the mayor of the city. He wouldn't dare. He used to send over like, a little boy to go and to call my father. 

My father used to come over. And he used to conduct whatever he could, little by little, to make for this suit, and for the other one, something else. And my father was involved from Germany. It's called Grof Tilo Winkler. That was a very big-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Hunting area. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --aristocratish like, a grove. That he possessed a lot of land in that part of the world. But of course, he lived in Berlin. And my father used to make like, you know, a lot of order, like, 20 suits of this and 20 of this, and that sort of a thing. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: There was a lot of hunting-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hunting outfits. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In that time, everything was taken away from us. Everything was taken away. And my father hardly made-- we hardly made a living. Only what, you know, one will lead, and one, the other one, was supporting, you know, that you only had one-- ends to meet. And we were struggling though, you know, to make enough food for the table, that we could do. And this was going on-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And the peasants knew us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The peasant people, the farmers used to bring in. Um, or we used to go to them. And they would sell us food. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Or we were trading. They used to tell my father, listen, you make me a pair of pants or something, I'll bring you a bushel of apples. I'll bring you a bushel of this. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That's how they used to-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Or I'll make it up with something else. The food, for exchanging, for whatever the service my father done. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any other changes in your life? You're now, 1940? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: This was, already, '43. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What else changed in your life in the town? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Well, when you went to school. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Well, you see, right afterwards, towards the-- the-- the Hungarians occupied in 1939. And we were under their rule until 1944. It came in the '40s. Like, '41, '41, that's when we started to see, already, anti-Semitism-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --coming in. They were already taking censors. Every couple of months, they were going around, taking censorship, counting how many members, how many members in the family, who's living where, in what. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And remember, Sylvia, they were trying to throw, you know, already, rocks in the school. They used to call us budos zsido, it means like, "dirty Jew." 

SYLVIA BRODACH: "Dirty Jew." 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And then the Hungarian came out that Jews would not get white m-- flour. In other word, we were-- we got tickets. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We got our restrictions started to come in effect. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Food restrictions. Excellence No, we weren't allowed-- we didn't have any kosher meat. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And we had to have-- that's when we had to have a yellow star. So I then-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But that was-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That was in 1943. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but that was before already. We-- Jewish people didn't have their kosher meats. If you bought a ko-- a chicken and you went, on the side, to the shochet to kill that chicken, you know, there was no ritual meat anymore. That was forbidden. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: See, we were brought up strictly Orthodox, very strict. My grandmother, our grandmother, was a very, um-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Religious. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Religious person. And she was like, uh, very well respected in the community. And people, whenever they used to have problems, you know, these things, they used to come to her. Whenever there was uh, somebody in need of something, they used to come to her for help. If there was a poor girl getting married, she would make sure that she had a little dowry put together, and things like that. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It-- it-- it-- it-- it was always customary, that the town, every town, took care of their-- of their poor people. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Is that your personal experience? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: This is my personal experience. That even I, myself, every Friday, have to go-- my grandmother put some challah, you know, a piece of meat, a little bit, rice, or something, or would send me with a package to this family, to go to take over. 

And my sister, who used to wear a scarf, that people had dignity and-- and nobody, in a way, didn't want to know, you know, how-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That it was-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --they're poor people. So you're supposed to cover it with a scarf, you know what I mean? That neighbors or somebody shouldn't know that you come and bring, for Shabbos, that it was always-- every family did support the poor people, and took care of-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: On Friday nights, my grandmother used to go every Friday night to services. And whenever there was a poor passerby or uh, a beggar that came into the synagogue, you know, had no place to go, my grandmother would take him home with her and bring him. She would always give him the head of the table. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Really? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To sit down at the head of the-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And you remember, they had a-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And we were children. And we used to say, dirty, you know, old man, and he was sick looking. And she always used to say, children-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. I remember an experience-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: So then what did she say? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: She always used to say, you have to take care of your sick and poor people. And you have to make him feel welcome. And the only way you can make him feel welcome, part of the home that he happened to be in is given the head to sit on, at the head of the table. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. And I remember peddlers. In Europe, was customary peddlers was going. And whatever Friday night the Shabbos used to come in, they stopped in that town. So the first thing, they going in, into the temple. And every balabusta it means every home, at every-- how do you say in English? A balabusta means like-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: The head. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --the head of the house used to bring in a poor person or a peddler, you know, for Shabbos to his own. And they were used to be divided. You know, everybody used to take in home. 

And sometimes, you know, we had-- my father brought in a person, you know, that didn't look so appetizing. You know, with something here. And he-- and I remember as a kid, running away from the table. And my grand-- then all the kids run away too. And my grandmother used to go to me, after the fact. She used to say, my kin, she said, why you do that? You know? Isn't that better to give as to receive, you know? I was so young, I didn't understand what that means. You know what I mean? I cannot sit at a table with somebody who is-- looks that way. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But that's the kind of a-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And this is the kind of life we led. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --up-- upbringing and life that we-- we grew up in. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: So what happened with the-- with the chicken? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: To sh-- to share, you know, and to-- and then later, when the Germans already came and the Hungarian came in, we weren't allowed to have ritual meat. There was closed up. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The slaughterhouse was closed down. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Every-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: So there was no beef or veal, you know, available. The only meat, you know, was if you happened to be able to get a live chicken and ritually-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And we went um, to the shochet 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And it's in the back, at night. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --in the back. And then he could shekhtn it. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Slaughter the chicken. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: That's the only way we had. And then they start breaking the windows, the Hungarian people. And then to the end, you weren't allow-- allowed to go out. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: At night, after sundown. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know, seven o'clock. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We weren't allowed to go in the streets. And in order to be identified, we have to wear a yellow star. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In the back, one, and one in the front. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And in the front. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And then, I remember in 1944, that was it, in '44. It's going to be now, two weeks before Passover. That must have been like, a march. We were already all ready for Passover. We had our matzahs-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Baked. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --it was breaked in five and back in the living home. And I remember, like today, the Germans came in, in the morning. And then the-- late in the afternoon-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We heard, in the street, some rumbling during the night, the tanks. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know, like a full-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Uh, my mother got up in the middle of the night. And there were loud noises in the streets. And you could hear. We didn't know what was going on. And there was like, rumbling. Rows of tanks were coming through the town. And they parked those tanks in the center. And we had a big park. It's called the Masaryk park. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And in there was like, a big square, open like, where the peasants used to bring in their wares to sell. And that's where they parked all their tanks. And we got up early in the morning. We heard those noises during the night. And in the morning, the SS were already roaming around town. And they were knocking on doors. They wanted girls. They were knocking on our door. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, I-- I-- I remember-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And they wanted to know uh, for girls. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I-- I-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: So my sister, she was the older one, she jumped out of the window. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But so we remember, I remember, I was sleeping with my sister in one bed, you know? And the knock came in. And they came, two soldiers, you know, with bayonets. My father spoke German, because he worked for Grof Tilo Winkler. 

And he learned in Hungary. He was brought up in Hungary. And he spoke German too. 

And he-- they came out. And they opened every door. And I were sleeping with my sister. I must have been maybe 17 years old. 

So we were all covered up with a-- with a quilt. And then they went in the other room. And I heard, you know, German to Yiddish is very-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Similar. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: There's certain things, you can experience. You know what I mean? And I heard one telling the other one, you know, that they come for the-- for the girls. 

And I remember that I opened the door. And I jumped out the window. Because we had-- it was the windows were a-- about that high, you know? To the garden. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From the bed, yeah. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And I run out with my pajama only. And I was wandering the whole night, you know? And he was coming in. And my s-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: You know, in our store, there was a lawyer. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: No, Sylvia, I was in the kammer; I was hiding. You know, that was in the middle of the night already, I was hiding. And I-- I remember my father said, no, he only had one girl. You know? He's-- one says, yeah, I see two hats there. You know? 

And my father was trying to tell, confuse him. Like, you know, my sister was like-- because she was a kid yet, and I was already 17 years old. And when I jump out, he came back. The German, he says, he remembered seeing two hats. And meantime, I was hiding in the kammer. You know, in the-- in Europe, we have outside, like, wood. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The woodshed. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And I was hiding there. They went looking. And they were-- till in the morning. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They were looking for girls, for-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: For the girls. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They were looking for girls. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They remembered seeing two girls in the back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: For what? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The German soldiers, the SS. 

INTERVIEWER 1: For what? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: For their selves. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: For-- for their own pleasure. You know, they came in, and he's-- he remembered seeing two hats, two girls, under the bed. Because we were covered up, you know? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Because we have a hat, you know? 

INTERVIEWER 1: In 1944, the German SS-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: That was when the Germans came in. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Tried to round up Jewish girls for sexual-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --intercourses? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yes, yes. And from there on, that day, we already-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Then my aunt had a-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: A pantry. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --a pantry that was sort of like, built-in off the kitchen. And so there were my cousins and my sister spent about two weeks living in that pantry. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, wait a-- wait a minute, Sylvie. Every early in the morning, we had to get up very early and go in the-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Through the back. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --from the back, all the way to the back to mine-- my aunt's house. And we were hiding in that pantry. And they put a kitchen-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Uh-- uh-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In Europe they have like, for dishes-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: China closet 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: A-- a lot of China to put into the-- to the door-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To close off the doors, so you don't see in. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: To close it. When you come in, you couldn't see-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To conceal the-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --that there is a door, that there is a door back, you know? So all the girls, we used to hide there. And from there and then, we never seen the light out. We were hiding there till a day after passover. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you know of any Jewish girls that were taken by the Germans and-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. Not that we know. That were taken right in our towns. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Because the word spread out. You see, the night came in and you know, doesn't take long. One tells another, eventually she'll-- to the median. And one tell the other, you know what happen to me? The other one tell what they-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: From there on, everybody was alert. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: [INAUDIBLE] 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We already knew what was waiting for us. And we were hiding there till a day after Passover. 

INTERVIEWER 1: After Passover. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know? In Europe, where we come from, there was no radios, no nothing. So there were a drummer, going around, drumming. And the news was that he'll-- people gathered together in the middle of the street. And he was reading the news, what happens. I remember like today, the drum came in. That was the day after Passover. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The morning after. Like, let's say tonight is, at sundown, our Passover is out. And the next morning, early in the morning, we got the news that every Jewish pers-- people, they have just a couple of hours to pack. And you're allowed to take as much as you could carry. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Who-- who played this drum? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Well, there was an old man. You know, he was like, from the community. You know? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: [INAUDIBLE]. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They sent out to read to this, that all the Jewish-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: A proclamation that all the Jewish people of the community-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: All the Jews-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was he Jewish? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: No, he wasn't Jewish. He was like, from the-- from the state of-- of the-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Let's say, from the mayor's office, from the town hall. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: From the town hall. Yeah, that's right. He was like, a town hall. And he was reading. It was when all the people gathered, you know? And he was reading that all the Jews-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: He was announcing-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --should get ready. Let's see, this was in the morning, till two o'clock in the afternoon, in the temple. We should take only what we can carry with us. And we should leave everything behind. We are-- what did they say? We are go-- we'd be staying first, in the temple. They didn't say where we go, why do we go, or nothing. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Where you're going, we don't know. Just take with you as much as you can carry. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I-- I remember like today, you know, that was the day after Passover. We still had the chickens. And my grandmother says kinder, you know, at least we had small kids we were killing the chickens for ourselves, you know? And everybody was trying to cook something and put it, and take the marmalade, and take for the kids, you know, what you can do. 

And my father was very busy to sewing whatever, get something to save maybe. It was gold, that we were-- and he remembered the gold, and in other countries, that you could buy and sell well. So he took the jewelry, and he resewed the buttons. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: So that we had-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And he told me, this is for you, in case. And this is for my sister, this is for my mother. And my mother, he took out from the ghetto, Very good thing for you (SOBBING) you should leave with something. Go save yourself with with it. If we went into the temple, you know, those Hungarians and Germans start stealing the-- our [INAUDIBLE] or-- or-- or the earrings. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And they-- you see, they tell you to [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But after they made a list, about an hour later, we didn't really have that much-- there were two SS knocking on our door. And they asked us if we are ready. So we weren't even ready. 

They just-- whatever you happened to have handy, we took it. And we took it on our back. But you see, I want to go a little bit before that. 

You see, before they announcement was that they're going to-- you know, that you have to pack, there were rumors in town that something is brewing, that something is going to happen. So everybody sort of got, already, together. And we sort of planned. I don't know how or where the rumors came from, but they was that we're not going to be staying at home. So then we started to get ready, really, unofficially. My father believed-- he was a tailor, so he knew already, what to do. In the padding, he used to put in dollar bills. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Gold. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And the gold rings and everything. And the morning after that-- after the announcement came-- so it wasn't even an hour or two. I remember don't remember exactly. There was a knock on our door. And there were two SS standing. 

And he said, let's go. So whatever we happened to have handy, blankets, pillows, a little clothing, and whatever food there was in the house-- because it was after Pesach-- we just grabbed it. And we were rounded up. Within 5 or 10 minutes at the most, we were already on our way out of the house. And they herded us all into the syna-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: The synagogue. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mhm. You were in the the synagogue, you said? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah, and we stayed there around, till very late in the afternoon. And then meanwhile, there were p-- there more people in-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Wait, Sylvia. You remember my grandmother. When-- when we have to pack whatever we had, to go from the house-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: She had-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: She had a box. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: [INAUDIBLE] 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: That when you die, you know, that you-- she had a little sack from Eretz Israel line. I don't know how you say that. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The two little packs of the Israeli salt. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: From Jerusalem. Sent from-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And she carried that for a long time. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --from America, fr-- from her son, from Jerusalem. She runned, and she-- she-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: She carried that with her in her trunk 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: She took that after the bags and nothing else. She walked out only with this. She said, she doesn't need only this. She wants to take it with. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Wherever she went, this is what she carried with her. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And this-- this-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: All the time. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We went into the temple, and then we were stripped-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Stripped by the Hungarian, you know, women. We were-- they took you into a-- a separate room, the women and the men. That was in our own synagogue. 

And that's where they strip you. They took everything valuable away that they found. We were children, and we had golden earrings. 

And we knew that we shouldn't lose them. So my mother had it, like, soldered it closed permanently, in the earring. And with clamps, they broke the earrings right in my ears and all of our ears. And they took everything, they were looking for money and jewelry. 

So whatever they found on us, they took it away. And it got late. And just before sundown, while we were in the temple, they were bringing more and more people in. 

And it got to be very, very crowded. And we stayed overnight there. And we were just sleeping on the floors, on the-- on the floor in that um, big, uh, auditorium of the temple. And the next morning, early in the morning, they made us-- they-- we marched from the synagogue to the railroad station. 

And we carried all-- all the bundles that we were able to take with us. We carried it with us. And there was quite a long march, about a mile or two to the railroad station. And at the railroad stage, they got us into trains. And they took us into Ungvar, which was a brick factory. It was an outdoor open space. And the only shelters that they had is that it was-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: The roof. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They had on, a roof. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And it was open. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And in-- in the sides, everything was open. Just it had-- you know, like, in the brick factory, where they store the bricks. And that's where we st-- we lived there. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but wait a minute, Sylvia. We were coming in from Velky Berezny. They were coming-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From all-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --from Uzhhorod. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From all-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: From Munkacs, from Kashau. There were-- we were there, maybe 10,000 people-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Maybe more. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --put in-- in there. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From all surrounding communities. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Even, maybe, more, from all over, surrounding. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They gathered all the Jews-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It's you know, from every place. We were-- everybody was going to Ungvar ghetto, that was it called. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And that brick pla-- and that brick-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The brick factory. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It was a brick factory. Only thing it was is the roof. It's, you know, in a brick factory, it was nothing. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The ground. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And we were-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: It must have been a very large building. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And it was very huge. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It was a very-- a huge place. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: A huge place. It was a huge place, that they make fact-- they made bricks out of it. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And it was all closed in with fence, all fenced in around. It was an enclosed fence all around. And that's where they congregated us. They-- from all over, the-- all surrounding cities and communities-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Of the neighborhood. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They were bringing in the Jewish people, into there. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And the only shelter, really, we had, was just that it had a roof. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Awful. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And there was nothing on the ground. It was the earth, you know? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And-- and you remember that it was March. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: In the rain. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And that that part of the country is still very cold in March. So we were-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And the rainy season was on. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And we-- we were sleeping, you know, all people had to get together because it wasn't so space. So you know, let's see, my father, my mother, my grandmother, I, my sister, my brother, we were laying, you know, one after another. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: In a row. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Because next to us was another family 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Was a different family that we actually-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And then on the other side was in one line. In this line was another one. And it was only that much space-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Walking space through. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --that you could go through. Because in both sides, like this room, here would be the people laying, and here would be. And only one set of-- of space, you know, that you could walk through. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That you had through to walk across. 

INTERVIEWER 1: As far as you could see, thousands and thousands and thousands of Jews? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Thousands and thousands of people. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Everywhere, everywhere. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It must have been in the thousand-- you know, tens of thousands of people. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know, the-- you know, in other word, the factory was built here. It was a big place. And then I'd see the empty-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They had barracks all around. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It's always for another one, another one. It took you almost like, a half a day, if you went to go look for your cousin-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From one side. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --which side, from a diff-- let's say, my cousins came from a diff-- we have cousins from-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Surrounding communities. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --from surrounding communities. And we went to look for them, because they didn't all come at the same time. So we went to look for them. So it took you, you know, about 20 minutes to go find where it is. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To walk-- to walk through the place, to see. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And they, meantime, closed it in with-- with a big fence, and I'm running around-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And they had soldiers, all around-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Hungarian soldiers. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --with the uh, guns, guarding, watching. And there was a big gate, which way they let you in. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And in the gate, there were two soldiers staying, you know, in the front. And from the gate, across the street, they built like, a headquarters uh-- um-- uh-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: For the military. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: A police headquarters, that they were changing the guards. And they were making, you know, the rounds. They make it like, across the street. Uzhhorod is a big city. And there were still a Jewish, um, hospital. You know? There was still like, a mental retarded hospital they had. And-- and they had children's, you know, hospital, that the Jewish children, they couldn't have broughten in. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: - Orphans 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: So what they done, they-- they took people from the ghetto, you know, and then they came in looking for girls. You know? But this was a little bit after, which right now-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And you know, it was so cold. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It-- it was-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And we were lucky that my mother took the beddings. And you know, in Europe, you had the down quilts, big ones, and the pillows. And that's what we carried with us. 

And we were lucky. We didn't take much food. But we took the bedding with us. 

So we were lucky. We were warm, that we were able to put one quilt on the ground. And one, we covered all of us. And we had a couple of pillows that kept warm. Because the muds-- it was a brick factory. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It was raining there. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And the muds were up to your ear. There was no place to wash, or even to cook something. And eventually, what my mother did is, she put two uh, bricks together and made a little fire-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: With her-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That we-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --winter boots. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: You went to collect little uh, branches, you know? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Boot. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: You know, little-- you know, things to boil up a little water-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --that we caught from the rain, in a pot. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, by that time, it's March, '44. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: The-- the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know where you were being taken? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: No. No. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We didn't know nothing. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We were in that ghetto for over-- for a month. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Two months. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Two months. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: From Passover until it's shavuos. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Shavuos. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It's a month. It's just a month. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: At most, I think it was like-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Just a month. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --six-- six weeks. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: About five weeks, the most. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But your grandmother seemed to know-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But you see, we didn't know-- nobody know nothing. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Nobody know. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Nobody told us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You didn't know about death camps? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Nobody did. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But towards the end, there were like, a few postcards, came into the ghetto. And there were rumors that we are going to-- because they started to liquidate the ghetto. They started to ship people out. And the rumors were-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Sylvia-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --that they were taking people to a working camp. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But wait. Tell-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And-- and-- and that we-- we were going to be, uh, separated. That women will be separated from the men. So at that time, my father started to make, from whatever he-- there was, you know, a little clothing or something, from the linen, and knapsacks. 

For each child, a knapsack. Because the rumors were that we're going to be separated. So he made up a knapsack for each child to carry on its shoulder, with a few personal belongings. And he told us in the shoes and wherever he hid some money in the clothing. So he divided it, so each child can-- in case we'll need food, or what. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But in between, in during that month, my sister got to get a job outside the ghetto. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but I-- wait a minute, Sylvia. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you think-- are you calling the brick factory a ghetto? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah, that's what we were-- we called, at that-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Who gave-- who gave you food in that place? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't-- they didn't give-- there was no food till-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: There was no food. Every once in a while, a wagon came in with loaves of bread that they threw in. And whoever happened to be lucky enough to get one, or be at the right place at the right time. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And I-- I remember when we were-- my little brother, you know, he was about eight years old. And he told my mother he wants to have a azo styckele broyt. He only told my mother, like this he showed, he wants to have only that, for a small slice of bread. And he was so hungry. And then every morning, the people were going to the gate, you know, looking-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To see-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --to go in to work. They were liquidating all Jewish prop, Jewish linen, there was furniture. They was all shipping it to Hungaria-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: So they needed workers-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --to Germany. You know, they're from-- from the city, from all those wealthy people. And people were getting out to go to work. Because when they were out, they could buy something. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They were able to get a piece of bread or something. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: So I remember one morning, I got lost. And I went to the ghet-- I went-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: To the gate. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --to the gate. And I chosen too, you know? They-- they just picked people. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And she got a job working. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And the rumor-- and the rumor came. You know, that they took the girls. They did took girls out. I was lucky. I was working very hard. And I-- I got clothes, then I brought bread. 

And I brought things into the ghetto, you know? From then on, every morning I went to work. When I-- before I came back from work, my father ask me, from far away, how I will help what do they do to you? I remember like today. 

I can't understood. I said-- just shake with the head. And then my father said that I had to wear a scarf, you know, to look-- make myself old. And I shouldn't-- you know, they didn't want to let me go out. 

And I s-- I begged my father that I go out. Nothing's going to happen to me, that I'll take care of myself. But I can bring in so much food that the kids could eat. 

And then my father agreed, and I went out from that day, every day. And then one day, the big captain came in. And he seen that I work very good. And he chose me, that I should clean this place. 

He was a Captain, in the police force. And I was chosen for him to-- to-- to clean his place and make it nice. They brought in all the Jewish furniture and the linen, and all the silver and everything. And I supposed to make him a living quarters. 

And I work very good. And he-- he began starting after me. You know, I was 17 years old. He could have been my father, you know? And then I start crying about it. And he kind of had a little mercy, and he left me alone. as he brought in-- you know, he picked other girls from , from the ghetto, whatever he chose, in to his place. 

And he let me clean and do work from there on. Every day I brought in a girl from the ghetto. All the children came to my mother and to hide, and because I was already known there, and they didn't search my things when I came in, in the-- in the ghetto, back from outside, they didn't search it, because they knew that I worked for the captain. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But you keep saying that this was a ghetto. And really, it was-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: This was a ghetto. 

INTERVIEWER 2: No, but-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: This was a-- this is-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: A ghetto, there are places to sleep, and houses. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: No, this was a-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: But this was-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: This was a-- they called it a teglagyar. It means, in Hungarian, they called it a teglagyar. It means the-- the brick factory. There was our ghetto. We were there but for six weeks, open place. And there were-- there were people dying down there. There was nowhere. There were-- a toilet was on open space, made a hole in there, where people were going. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Like a hole. They brought in all the Jewish patients from the hospital. They brought from the mental institutions all the beggars from the streets, and all the people, they were all congregated in that brick factory, that they kept the Jewish people, until they liquidated. Towards the end, after the four-- about, uh-- after four weeks they started to liquidate the-- the-- the uh-- the-- the-- the ghetto. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They were taking people, but nobody knew where. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. The rumors were-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Nobody knew where-- where we going. We going to work. We going to work, they took a transport out of the ghetto. They took-- it took maybe a month or so each time. The Jews, they'd say-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And it was less and less people in the place. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But I like to-- to remind here, while I was working, and that captain, you know? And they had people you know, who were very wealthy. You know, like doctors and lawyers, who had a lot of wealth. And they couldn't find their wealth. So they took them in from the ghetto for questioning. You know? And I had seen people go walking in there. Then I heard scream. 

[CRYING] They used to take out the people on the stretcher, all beaten up because they didn't tell them where they were hidden. They couldn't. They say, they didn't have more. That's what they have. And they were taking people out. 

They had a list. And every day, they came into the ghetto, looking for doctor so-and-so, for Mr. This-and-this. And then they couldn't find enough wealth. And they kind of visualized they have more, and where had they hidden it? 

They wanted to know where. And they brought them in down there to the-- to the-- to the police headquarters. You know? And I-- while I was working there, I have seen the way they used to take out people. You know, have them beaten up, because they didn't believe them, that that's all they have. 

They didn't have more. And they just wanted to question, what did he do with his-- with his wealth? Because in Europe, people had a lot of jewelry They were very wealthy people, and they had a lot of wealth. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And if they felt that there was not enough, what they find, they came to question you, what did you do with it? Then they used to beat them. They used-- there was a piece of board with nails. 

They could not-- they used to put a man on that, and they used to step on it. And that's the way they used to-- frage that means questioning the people, you know? Having that, they brought them out. And this was in the ghetto. And we al-- people already, little by little, knew. People used to tell things, you know, because everybody was afraid, what's going to happen, you know? And in time, they were trying, already, shifting around, taking out transport. Nobody know where. They take you, nobody know where. And then finally, we came in-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did they pick out the transport? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They had a list, tomorrow morning-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: There was a list. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --family, Weinstein, Greenbaum, Goldstein, whatever. There was a list, picked up the people, you know? In the morning, they-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They had everything on the names. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Just the names. 

As Because you see, while we were still home, about the year before, they start to take censors. You know? They went around. The names, how many children you had, and how many people in your family, and all that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hmm. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: So after we got into the uh, brick factory, they had all these names in front of them. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And that's how they liquidate. The family of this and this, get ready. Or get ready, there was nothing there to get ready, what just had with you. You walked from the ghetto, another couple of miles walking, whatever little you had left of your personal belongings, to the freight, you know, to the railroad station, where the freight, you know, cars were waiting. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but, you know, you-- you were asking of the gentile people. They all knew every person. You see, Europe, you know, it wasn't such a big Everybody knew everybody, because you were born there and you died there. You know, you didn't move from one place to another. So they had a list, who had what. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know, when they came in already, the Hungarian, they already had everything. in other words, they know who you were, what you had, and where is It. So there was no such thing. You know, they already had their people, who they investigated. And they told them what. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Uh, how were you taken away? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: So then we came, we were the last one from one thing. There were two-- two ghettos in Ungvar, not one. There was teglagyar, and there was another one. 

The other one was much better. When they closed up our ghetto, we were between the last one. And we went over there. We went like they ship animals. You know, those open trains? We were about 50 people. You know, like you-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: A little cubicle. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You make yourself, my mother, my father, you know, we were all-- and next to me was another family, and another family, another family, another family. And we knew when-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They were all packed in, like animals. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And for the toilet, there was a big barrel. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Bucket. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And that was used. And that's why we-- we went into Auschwitz, like that. I remember, like today, I Were 17 years old, and I wanted to light a cigarette. 

And I went over to my girlfriend down there. And I was looking what my father was saying. My father told my mother-- I only heard a whisper-- "Who knows how long she'll be able to do that?" I don't know what they're talking about. What do you mean? You know? 

I didn't-- I couldn't understand what my-- what my father was telling my mother, who knows how long I was-- you know, in other words, I wouldn't dare ever smoke in front of my parents. You know what I mean? And that time, I allowed myself to do. And I only heard my father say, who knows how long? 

But I didn't understand what it-- what-- what he means. We were sitting there, and finally, we came in. We were riding there, I don't even know. I only know it was night, a night again, a night again, a night again. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: There were days. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: A night again. A night again-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I didn't know where we going. There-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah, but that was on the freight cars-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --that we were all packed in. That was-- uh, they took us into Auschwitz. It took about three days of traveling. And the only time we uh, you know, the freight cars are closed. And there's just a little like, opening. And we realized that we are being shipped to Poland. Because as the train went by, we noticed the names of different towns. And it was-- we were going into Poland. 

And it took about three days. They never opened up the cars. It never stopped. It just constantly was going. And we were suffocated, practically, there. And because there were so many people crammed into a small pace-- place, there was no water. People were fainting. Elderly people were dying. And finally, after three days of travelling, they opened up the cars. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe that exactly? The-- the arrival? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It was suddenly. Uh, I think it was in the morning. And they opened up-- the train stopped. And we didn't even know where we were. But before we were l-- we left the ghetto, the rumors were that we are being shipped to working camp. 

And the rumors were that women were-- are going to be separated from men. That's all. So at that time, by-- by the time we got on those trains, we already had our own little knapsack and all that put together. And when the train, after three days of traveling, the train suddenly stopped at a place like nowhere. 

Then suddenly, opened up the doors. And when they opened up the doors, everybody stuck their head to see where we were. And there were a lot of people standing outside. And there were um, wires And uh, there were mountains of clothing that we saw and handbags. And there, they announced, in German, there were all the SS staying-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Wait-- wait a minute, Sylvia, remember, a lot SS were, you know-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: In black uniforms. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: With their uniforms, with gloves, and you know, we were looking. And I remember my father saying, you know, that-- first, I heard-- and because Jewish and German, and I studied a little bit, German, in school too. And I heard they say, that men here, this goes here. 

And the tumult was in-- in-- in the-- in the-- in the train, the people start panicking. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah, everybody's starting, coming. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: They didn't know, and they was going with those rubber, um-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Hoses, like. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know, the sticks, rubber sticks. You know, here, there. And we were very scared. And we didn't know nothing. I remember my father, you know, he was grabbing my brother, you know. And my mother, the four-- of the five-- the five-- the five kids. My mother and me, my sister, we were holding together. [SIGHS] 

And as we come down, they were-- the SS pushed my father here. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They announced it. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And we go here. And my mother was going with me, with my sister. And they was 8, 10, 11. 

They pushed her here. And I remember, my-- my mother-- the kids start crying, mommy, mommy, you know? And my mother pulled herself away from me. And she says, ...[INAUDIBLE] sollst du ... you should take care of your sister, like if you were a-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: I know, Frances. When they opened up the freight trains, so they announced it on the last--because that men will go on this side, and women will go on this side. Then women with small children on another side. So we were, the minute we stepped off the freight train, we were separated, right there and then. My father and my older brother went on one side. My sister, she was a tall girl. 

So they made her go to one side. And I went, with my mother. And with the uh, younger children. And my mother looked around. And she says, well, where is, uh, your sister? 

I said, they made her go over there. And on the freight train, it was so hot, with so many people. 

You see, when we left the ca-- the ghetto, we put on a half of dozen of this, on ourselves, and a half a dozen stockings, under things. So we would have left the camp, we have it, in case they'll take it away from us. So whatever we are have on ourselves, we'll have it. And it was hot, and she undressed. And she took off a couple of dresses. She was left just with one dress on her back. 

So my mother's asked me, wheres your sister? So I said, they made her go over there. So she tells me, you run after her, because she only has one dress on her. And they pushed her in one side. And I was running from one place to another and I don't know how. 

Because in Auschwitz, you just did not run from one place to another. But somehow, I caught up with her. And uh, I found her. 

And we were marching, you know? They took us into a section, where all the women arrivals came in. And that was a big, long barrack. And you stayed there. And there were thousands and thousands of people. It was-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but remember, Sylvia-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They told you to get undressed. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: When-- as we came in, we were standing five on the line. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: So they counted us. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Five, everybody have to stay, five in the line. They tell you to strip out everything, only thing you hold is the shoes. And the line is going, and going, and going, and you don't know where you go. I mean, each time it's kind of more people. I said to my sister, I got to go see what they're doing. And I pushed myself through. And I seen there were a big room. There were-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Barbers. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: What do you call that you shave the hair all over your body. There were about 18, on this side, maybe 18. And here, people, men, women, you know, shaving the hair off of the girls. 

And I seen it. I was pushing myself through to come to my group. And I said to my sister, my girlfriends. There were five people together. You know what they're doing. They're shaving off the hair. And right away, I start looking. I remember, I had a red scarf. And I told everybody what they're doing. So you look for a scarf to put on your hair. And I remember I had in the shoes. 

When they said undress, and I took out a couple cigarettes and sticked them in my shoes. And my sister-- and there came an SS, somebody came in to see what I was doing, pushed me. And I pushed back. You know, I didn't know where I am. I didn't know. And they says, she says, you know something, where you are, if I wanted-- she said, you came in through the door, and you going out through the chimney. 

I said, what is he saying? What he talking about? Do not understand what does it mean? And she took everything away from me what we had. And this is the way we was. We went finally in, group by group in that room. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Until you reached-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We were standing. And they shaved you all over your body, everything. And then they give you a dress. The shoes you hold. There was another woman giving you an evening dress, or this dress. You didn't know. Whatever they give you, you grabbed. 

And we were sent out in a big room with cement on the floor. And they disinfected us, you know. They put something disinfection under your arm and everywhere on the head. And we were holding the dress, and we came out. And we start putting in there. 

One dress was too long, one was too big. It was so cold. And we were all shivering. And I remember everybody went and-- I tore up my sister's with my teeth. It was too long, the dress. And I put on for her. And other girls did the same. Put a little belt. And put a scarf. 

And I took my sister into my dress to warm, because it was so cold out. And in comes in the SS woman with her boots and with her stick. And she looks around and she sees we all have scarves, and we look. And I remember like today, she said you verfluchte [damned] you. You said, you can be sent out to an empty field till you come back dressed. Because we had a little scarf put it on head because it was so cold, you know. They shaved all the hair off. And we were standing outside, and it was so shivering. 

In Poland down there, in March. It was cold, and we didn't know it was warming. We, one another, if you had a big dress, you took in your sister or somebody underneath to keep from the body temperature, to hold you. And we were there but maybe 24 hours. I remember. We were so dying there. If you stick out the head, it was raining. They were shooting because you wanted to put a little water, because you were fainting. 

The women were lined up sardines. When one turned over, everybody had to turn over. We were-- we were there, I don't remember, it was like it seems to me that time forever. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We were in Auschwitz. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And we were selected, you know. There was like, they take 50 women, or 50 girls. They say five, 10, 15, march out. And we were taken. I remember we were travelling a long time. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Over those three days. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: You see, we were-- when we, they shaved us all. And we were in Auschwitz for three days, in barracks. 

And outside, all that going down, there was a big band playing music constantly, day and night. They had bands playing all kinds of music. There was smoke, heavy smoke. There were babies screaming, you know. And you heard, just babies screaming. You were looking where it's come from, but you couldn't see where it's coming from. There were open fires, and babies screaming, and a band playing. And there were garbage in the str-- in the, in the camp. People were working, you know, in gardens. And we were in those barracks for three days. They only took us out for, they called it, an appell, that-- for countdown. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And now did you know-- think of your parents, and of your friends? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We didn't know nothing. My grandmother walked out from the freight train in Auschwitz, and they, they took her right with the mothers and babies. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but you know-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They were shipped right to the crematory. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, but they told us that, you know, after work, you know, when we get all showered, then we'll, we'll meet again. You know, they told us, you'll meet them-- everybody was screaming and crying around me --and they said, you know, don't cry, you'll be after they go shower in there, you'll meet them in the afternoon to meet again. And since then I have never seen-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The last time we saw my father, my brother, my grandmother, my mother, and the-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: My sister. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --and the poor young'uns. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --my brother. That was the last time I seen them. It was the March. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We were in the-- in the barracks for about three days. The only time we went out of the barracks is when they was countdown. It seems like forever they were counting. In the morning, they were counting. You had to stay for hours early in the morning, and for hours at night. 

And we never saw a piece of-- any kind of form of food at all. People were fainting. When they got into the barracks, during the night there came a storm, like God sent water. And there was leaks. And everybody stuck out their tongues to get a drop of water. Because for three days, people were just fainting and falling apart. Finally, after three days, we went out again in the morning for the-- for an appell, for countdown. There 

And you see, even though from one minute to next, they decided they want to have a countdown, you had, you were all hoarded out the barracks. And you had to line up. You had to have your own five all the time. God forbid you should be left off with three or two. So we were, my sister, myself, and there were two, three girls, our friends. So we were five. Wherever we went, wherever we stood, we were always the five of us. Because you never could tell when they were going to call for countdown. 

And after those three days, those horrible three days, we were out standing and the SS keep counting. And they were one number off. They stopped the count-- and you didn't know where you were. They counted 5, 10, 15, you know, 20. And they, here, they stop. They made you go here, and the rest of them they made to go there. 

It just so happened that they decided that this is the magic number for them. You hap-- we were happened to be the lucky one. Because they counted off here, so we were all hoarded off, march back to the-- to the freight train. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. And-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Back to the freight cars. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --remember, as the freight train was lining up, and they were dragging us, the SS. And the other side-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: There were monocles of glass, 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Glasses. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Children's shoes, 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Clothes. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Clothes. Bags. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: All kind of things was-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Mountains. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --aside. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Mountains of things. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --the train. And here, on the side was left by people. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And here we hadn't eaten a thing. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --didn't know what-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And my sister, she was a very daring person all the time. So there were mountains of handbags. And there was sticking out from one of the bags a piece of bread. So she asked the SS, can I take that bag. So he was generous enough, he said, OK, this one? And she says no, not that one. That one. And he picked it up and he gave it to her. And when they took us into the freight train, all of us, there were about 100-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Don't forget, we were 150 women in-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: In one car. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Freight train. But also, toilet was a barrel. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: A barrel. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And this is the way, from that barrel that I-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We lived, all of us. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --though that we had find English walnut, a pair of scissors, and we find a red bread, and I don't even remember what was there. So all the 150, everybody got a little bit, you know, to eat till we got in-- we came into Riga. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Latvia. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And Kaiserwald. That was called Riga, but Riga had two camps-- Spilve and Kaiserwald. And we came in to Kaiserwald. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The Kaiser forest. And in that forest, we saw pieces of clothing laying, bones. You know-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Horrible things. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It was very frightening for us. When we came in, we see the skeletons, there were skeletons laying all over. And we were marched in to that concentration camp they called Kaiserwald. I guess that's the name of the forest it was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Kaiserwald. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Kaiserwald. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Kaiserwald was a residential area. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: A camp. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No, no. That was city outside, because you see, from the Kaiserwald they took us out to work in the city. But that was a secluded place, in the forest, that they had built up. 

And that thing was already electric wires all over. And you saw There had, you know, the-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: The skeleton. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: The skeleton, you know, on it. And they, it said all over that Arbeit macht das Leben frei. And-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: There were already people who came from Germany, from, from Poland, They were already years before. When we came in, they were all well-established. Those people that, they were already, the way of life settled. And we didn't know who they are, where we are, what we doing here, what purpose. I mean, we were looking, we didn't know what-- we, we didn't know. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SYLVIA BRODACH: When they looked at us, they thought that we were brought in from mental institution. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You know, because we didn't have no hair. And they, already through the years-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They had already their hair grown in. And they were dressed. I don't how they got clothing. And we were just in that long one, no underwear, no nothing. Just one sack of a dress. And, when they brought us in, they assigned-- this is the-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: The barrack. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --barrack is for you. And they, you see, we also had to line up, and they counted so many people. You go into this barrack, and so many people go into the other barrack. And when we happened to walk into that barrack, there were Polish Jews there. And women, because the men on one side of the camp, there was electric wire. It separated from the men's camp from the women. 

And when we walked in, they looked at us like, they thought that we were from an as-- a mental institution. But they looked at us. The way we looked, you know. And they, they didn't want to have anything to do with us. 

And little by little, they started to asking us where are we from, and where are we coming from. And that's how we got to know each other. And there was like bunk beds, you know, a layer, up and down. Three decks. And we got the upper deck, my sister and I. 

And the next morning, they took us out. They sorted you out. And they assigned you to different jobs. So first, we were working in the forest, shoveling sand. They were like the miners used-- the coal miners, those, I don't know what they, those little carts that they bring the coal out. We used to fill those up with sand. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But you know what we were doing? They brought in gas an after. There was a war going on. And they had them like, under the ground. And we supposed to cover up all those trains cutting through the grass, you know. First we made holes, and they, and they were lining up those trains filled with gas. And we were working with them. 

Every day you could have been lucky to be assigned to one job to another. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Because if you stayed in to say you were sick-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: No. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --so the rumor was, even if you sick or not, you stay in the line and go out on the job. Because if you are left in the barrack, that's the end. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: But remember, we came in. There a doctor, Dr. Bolek. I never could forget. He was and Aryan from Czechoslovakia. And He came in, and he arrived, that we had heard that from Czechoslovakia. He came in a group. Because every day they brought a different group. From here, from there, was constantly shuffling around. 

And he came in, and I remember like today, he says, children, he says, you should never be sick. And he told us, you know, this is a way of surviving. That you have to watch for your life. And he actually explained to us where we are. And this is what's going on, and this is where we came from, in Auschwitz, and what Auschwitz was. 

We didn't know nothing. We've heard nothing. Because we were the last transport. And we came in like an innocent kid. We didn't know nothing what's going on. 

And he was always in touch with us, and explained not to volunteer for nothing. Just go alone, whatever, and if you happen to be there, you're there. Never complain. Never, whatever you should be straight. And stay-- don't nothing, don't-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --carry with you a plate with a wooden spoon. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: That's the way it was. We had-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: He said, never leave it in your barrack. Always tie it to, we had a string, you know, tied in our waist. And always have your plate and-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Spoon. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --the wooden spoon. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: We made the little hole. You knocked through with a nail, you know what I mean. If it was always holding, this was always standing here with a-- that we find in trash cans, you know, piece of string can be there. 

So then later, I was working in Riga, by the, by the Riga, by the ocean. That they bring in, I don't know, how do you call this in English? You make for building, those big trees, you know what I mean. They were soaking the bree-- the, the trees in the ocean. And they put them in with--the Lithuanians, and they put them in on machines. They cut a tree in half, and they make four inches of the wood, you know. They sorting them out. 

So I was working with a Lithuanian and other, two more girls, were selected to work down there, to pick up, you know, those big trees, put them on the machine, you know. And taking them back. We were sent in, you know, every day with a couple SS men, to bring us into the factory. And in the evening, we were sent in to the camp. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They took us out with trucks. At that time, they loaded up trucks, you know, the military trucks. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: If it was far enough. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And they loaded us up on those trucks. And they took us out very early in the morning to work. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This doctor. The doctor was a German? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No, he was a Czech. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But a non-Jewish? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: A non-Jew. He worked outside, he had an office. He worked for a German doctor outside some place. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: He was a pol-- like a political capture, he was. He wore-- he had the hat. And when we came there, we already got our uniform. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They gave us a number. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: We had gray, with about an 1 3/4" stripes. You know, like we had a jacket, a dress, the, you know, with a jacket. And here was your number. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: See, in Auschwitz they gave you, either they gave you a tattoo-- if you're not, if you weren't long enough in Auschwitz, like we were only three days. If you stayed longer in there, they tattooed your number on your arm. If you were shipped out, you were given a number sewn right on your dress. And from that day on, they never called you by the name. You have to remember your number. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember your number? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I don't, either. I got two numbers. So while I was there in Riga, you know. I-- we weren't there, I don't know, for a month or so and we got, and I caught typhus. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: She got sick. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Only thing I remember, because what they done was, for appell, they always took like, healthy-looking girls in the front. And they were trying to hide the elderly women, you know. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: In the back. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In their thirties, that they shouldn't be selected for the crematorium. They always selected the weak ones. You know. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They, they just walked by, and just looked at you. And if you didn't look too good, you know-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: You disappeared. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --they pulled you out. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: We didn't know where they took you. And later we find out that they were sending them into the crematorium. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was there a crematorium there? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: No, not a place. In Riga, was no crematorium, you know. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They shipped them someplace out of the camp. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Later we find out that, you know, you digged out your own hole, and they shot you, and that was it, you know. There was no crematorium, but that's-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: But they gonna, not gonna give you the food to eat if you couldn't produce. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Then I remember, we were only there one month in Riga, and I was standing, and I already-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: She fainted. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I felt, you know I got, all the time, a headache, and a headache. And I never was sick in my life. And I remember that Dr. Bolek came in the evening, you know. And he, you know, I said I have a headache. He says, just keep going. Just keep going. 

And only thing I remember is that I collapsed. I didn't remember anything anymore what happened to me. Pale, but maybe two weeks later. How did I know two weeks later? Because Dr. Bolek find out that I got, had typhus. 

And they put me in a different barracks. And the Germans were coming every day to see what-- they were experimenting on me, you know, I don't know what they were doing. But he used to tell me that they were experimenting on me. And I didn't know nothing for 14 days. 

When I woke up and I start-- I didn't, I forget, I forgot my name and I forgot who I am. I forgot everything. Till the Dr. Bolek used to sit with me. I became a new person. They gave me a new number. And I didn't know who I am. And he was talking to me every single day, and every single day, this and that. Little by little, I got back my memory. You know, he were telling me that I 

SYLVIA BRODACH: He used to bring in medication. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Had-- he didn't bring no medication. He didn't have any medication. They wanted, only wanted to experiment what, how I can survive. 

Nothing. I only remember, you know, that when I woke up, I didn't know where I am. And I was so weak. 

When I had to get up from the bed, go in for a new number. I used to sit down on the floor. It was like, the office was like, from here maybe to the end of the other room, from the hall. There was the office that you're going for a new number. 

And I had to sit down three times before I crossed there. Because I was a new person, that they all gived up on me, and that I had to go get me my number. And then little by little I remembered, you know. My sister, we were divided. In between, she was taken away. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: You see, they liquidated the concentration camp because the Russian front was getting closer. When every night, and during the day, we were hearing bombing. And we were just counting the day, as the bombs, you know, got closer and closer and closer. 

So one day, they started to liquidate the camp. By truckloads, they took us down to the harbor. And they put us on ships. First they put us downstairs. That's all they gave you when they liquidated. They had, must have left-- bread left over, so each one got a whole loaf of bread. And they took us on the-- until they li-- got everybody out in the holes. 

But whenever there were planes coming up. And we were in the holes for a long time without any air or anything. But whenever like, they were, I guess anticipating, you know, enemy planes were coming closer. And we heard them, you know, coming. So were rounded up from the bottom, put us back on the top, on the deck. So they used to camouflage their ships with us. 

And from Riga, we wound up in Danzig. In Danzig was just like a trans-- camp. And we didn't stay there too long. And they, also, you know, every day, no matter where you happen to be, early in the morning, rain of schn-- shine, in the snow, you had to stay in line until they got satisfied with the countdown. They just cut off and this groups goes here, and that group goes there. 

So from Danzig, so they shipped us to Stutthof. And Stutthof was really a second Auschwitz. It was the most terrible camp. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were alone. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah. We were already separated. And I didn't know where my-- I knew my sister got sick, and I, and I started to, I wanted to stay behind, but they wouldn't let me. They just got everybody, every able person that was able to walk, they got them out. 

And I was with my sister's three friends. So we were together. And I was crying, and I didn't want to go. And they no, there's nothing you can do. You have to go. And I went. 

Well anyway, we wound up in Ausch-- in Stutthof. And Stutthof was a terrible camp. It was, they beat you. 

They, if they told you to line up for food. So you lined up for food. And as you walked in to the mess hall, whatever they called it, so they had two SS, one on each side of the door, standing. And they'd let you go through. And you got your bowl of hot dirty water. And as you were coming back, they beated you. If you were lucky enough to have, that a drop or two was left, you were lucky. 

But everybody had to go through that. And I was there for a very long time. Because, somehow, I was very little. And through the months, I was skinny, I was only skin and bone left. As they were counting out transport, and to ship out for working projects. So they always kicked me out. 

And one day, one night, they had an urgent call for about I don't know how many thousands of women. They aroused, woke us up middle of the night. And we went out and stand in line and they count us off. And I was lucky, I don't know lucky or not. And they count us off, and they put us on other boats, and they got us in it was in Poland. I don't remember what kind of a town it was, the name of the town, but it was in Poland. A small town. 

And they needed help right away, because I guess, you see, the Russian front was getting nearer and nearer. So they needed some working, you know, help. And they got us out there. And at that-- they didn't have ready-made, you know, barracks. They just, seems like in a hurry, put up another camp for us. And there were like tents around, circle tents. And it was already cold. It was already getting the late fall. 

And we were about 2,000 women in a circle about the same size about this room, and you were laying. That's all we had is that little dress they gave us in Auschwitz. And my shoes were-- the shoes were still from home. And they were already falling apart, that I had to, whatever I found. I had to knot them together. 

And they took us out to work. And we had to walk. They gave us shovels to go out to work. So we were making bunkers for the Germans. That, if the Russians were coming any closer, we cut out like, big you know-- you know, how many miles of lines long across the fields. That if the Russians-- they were camouflaging. 

We had to dig them so many yards deep. They started out wide like that, and by the, I don't remember how many yards, kilo-- you know, meters deep. But when it came to the end, it was just that much wide. And when it was all had-- they measured it. It had to be a certain measurement, and even. 

And when that was finished, so they used to cover it with branches and with dirt. So as the Russian tanks were coming closer to them, they would fall in. And I don't know, they must have put bombs into it or, after we had finished it, they had a different crew come in. They must have put some bombs as they were coming in. 

So we were working in there. And my hands, I wasn't used to, you know, working that kind of work. So I had blisters. And it was cold. And I had big blisters. And it was very bad. And they had like, they called it a house, an infirmary, but there was nothing inside. And in it there was a Jewish girl. And she told me, Sylvia, she said, turn around and leave right away. Because if you're not going to take the shovel tomorrow morning, you're not going to last. You're not going to stay here. 

So, with the blisters, I was bleeding, you know, and I went out, and we were working. And the snow came. There was deep snow. And we were all, they, in the morning, they gave us a little cold, you know, hot, black, it looked like coffee, but it wasn't. It didn't even taste of coffee. And it was really very cold. 

And we had only, they gave us each a blanket. And we were sleeping like, pressed together. We kept warm with each other's body. And if one of them had to turn, so you gave a yell, and everybody around was turning over. 

And every morning, you got up, and you counted. There was another, somebody passed away, died, couldn't take it. So, you know, they were, every morning, you counted. And you sort of figured out when yours will be next. 

And outside, the corpses were mounting, you know. Because it was a lot of the stench, all around. And the corpses, they didn't have time to bury them. They were just laying. 

And that was in the late, you know, in the late fall, before the snow came out. And they took us out to work, and bring us up, you know, and then there was a, like a river, some kind of a water. When the weather was nice, they didn't take us out to wash or anything. But then the winter came. And it was a really already very, very cold. 

So they used to line us up, strip naked, and on a Sunday morning, where the village people-- because it was like on the outskirts, you know, like a small village, you know, mountain. I don't know where it was. And the people were going to church, all dressed up. We used to see them, all these people going to church on Sunday morning. 

And we were hundred, per hundred. They took us all naked strip, marching down the road to the river when it was freezing cold already to dip in the cold water, and come out, and marching back into the camp, and to put the blanket on. And that's how we stayed. So, and people couldn't take that, so they was dying. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Could you-- did village people look at you? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They looked at us, and just, just passed us by. They saw us every single day, because we went out to work. We marched. They didn't have buses or trucks at that, at that place. You had to work-- march for about an hour or two until you got to the working place. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you were walking naked through the street to plunge in the river, in the cold, and the people were going to church, were you aware of anybody reacting to you, any of the village-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: We looked at them, and they looked at us. And there was never any eye or contact, or say one word between us. They just passed us by, and we passed them by. They looked at us, we looked at them, and we just went on. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They were-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Sorry. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They went to church, and you went to the-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It was Sunday morning, and they were all dressed up. Because you see, during the week, they were ma-- you know, people, there were, when they took us out, we had to cross, you know, we were marching to work. And they were, I guess, going about their business. And on a Sunday morning, they were all dressed up. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The children didn't stare at 100-odd naked women? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: They just looked at us, and passed us like they were expecting it or they new about it. It didn't mean any difference to us. We passed them by and they passed us by. And we came back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was it silent? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It was quiet. Nobody said a word. Nothing. They just passed us by. They looked at us, and we looked at them. And we were shivering, and they were all dressed up. So the only thing that we, each one said, boy, wouldn't it nice to have this coat or this dress, and that's it. They didn't hear us, because we weren't close. They were on one side, and we were on the other side of the road. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were completely naked? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Completely naked. There was nothing on us. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Your shoes? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. No shoes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Barefoot on the snow? 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was the-- what was, how cold was it? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: It was freezing outside already. Because the water was very, very cold. A few days later, the snow was coming. So it must have been around in November, early November or something like that. 

And the snow came. It started to freeze already, and my shoes just gave away. I had no shoes. I was walking barefoot. And I caught-- I tore off a piece of my blanket. And I wrapped my feet around. And I went out to work. 

And when we finished that project, they took us out on another project, that we were like, esc-- to make miles and miles of like escape dugouts. There was just so wide, just enough that when a person, when the so-- the Germans, they got into it, was deep enough to cover their heads, and enough room they had just to run. They made us build, like, an escape route for them. 

Because you see, you could hear every night the bombings. We were already at work at night, laying in our, in our hole. We heard the bombing. And every day, as you counted the day, you wonder what's going to happen, how long will it come until the front will get closer, because the sounds of the bombing were getting closer. 

And here my shoes were already falling apart. And, and the bombings were getting, already, closer, because the sound was clearer. So they hoarded up the people who didn't-- we didn't have any more shoes, and my hands were frozen, my feet were frozen. It was falling off, you know, the flesh already. And the sick people, there were a lot of sick people. 

And they rounded us up, and we somehow knew already that's the end of us, and they took us out on a truck. There were two truckloads. I said goodbye to my s-- friends, that we were together. And I told them that, if case they'll meet my sister, or meet somebody from my family, to tell them what had happened to me, and where in, you know, that was the end of me. 

So they took us out to the, to a field, I don't know how may hundreds of people. And they made us dig our own grave. It was all-- dug our own grave. It was hard, because the ground was already frozen. It was cold. And they made us bend over with our knees, and all around us was the machine guns were put up on us. 

And at that time, I begged God. I said please, now. You know, people used to beg for their life. I just wanted death, to get it over with. Because, at that moment, it was just unbearable. Because you were skin and bone. I didn't have any more strength to work. And I was sick already. And the lice were all over me. 

And whenever at night we came home, all of us, the whole group, we used to take that little dress and blanket off, and take a rock and just kill the lice from our clothes, you know, from our blanket off. And our bodies were all covered with polka dots, all red spots where the lice were eating you up. 

And I was kneeling down, and I said oh God, please make it fast. And I said, that's it. I don't want-- make it as quick as possible. And we were sitting on our knees for I don't know how long. And all of a sudden, they blew the whistle, you know, one of them blew the whistle. And I said well, that's it. And they made us stand up. And I couldn't understand what had happened. And we looked around. 

And they must have gotten a message in, the got a load of wooden shoes, a train, a, a truck full, a load of shoes. Wooden shoes saved my life. And they handed us out the shoes, and they made us go back into the camp. 

Because the next day, you know, it was a snow storm. They were expecting snow, or what. The escape route filled up with snow. And meanwhile, they got a, I don't know, if you asked me how this all happened, I wouldn't know. They got a truck full of, of wooden shoes. And they needed the he-- labor help, or something. 

They gave us each a pair of shoes. They put us on the trucks, and they took us out the next early morning, because it was filled up with snow, the escape route that we had dug previously, filled up with snow. So we went out the next morning to shovel out the snow. And it, it was mild. We were shoveling for a few days, because they must have had a big snow storm, because it took quite a few days to clean that out. And we were, every night, late at night, they brought us into the camp, and the next morning, you counted out, you went out to shovel out the snow, you know, until you cleared it all up. 

And after the third-- fourth or the fifth day, and we were out, lined up, waiting for us to be taken up on the job again. Instead of taking us on the job, on the, that we recognized the route already, they were, and meanwhile, in between, the bombs, the Russian front was getting closer and closer. You could really hear them bombing. 

So I guess, instead of taking us to work that morning, they started to liquidate that camp, to move further back, because the front was getting closer. And we were walking in snow, because everything was covered with deep snow, and we were, it's like a death march. That must have been already after January, February. 

INTERVIEWER 2: 1945? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: '45. And they were, they called it the death march, because you always had to go ahead. Because those people, if you happened to fall down, or trip, that's it. You got the bullet right there and then. Because they didn't have time to be bothered, for you to get up. They were just pushing, faster, faster, faster. 

And whoever couldn't keep up the pace, was you know, falling behind or you tripped over the snow, so you got it right away and the rest kept on marching. So all the people didn't want to stay, sort of like, on the end of the march. Everybody was heading to be on the, on, on the front of it. 

And we were marching I don't know how many days, until one day, I guess the bombs were quieting down, because as we were marching, you could hear the bombing getting closer with us. We were pulling out, and they were pulling in. And it was about a few days of marching, day and night. And the line was getting smaller and smaller, until one night, it was late at night, they stopped us. 

I guess the SS were tired themselves, or hungry, I don't know. And there was a big farm, a barn. And it was a tremendous barn, and it was full with hay. And they made us go in. Whoever survived the march and the shooting got into that barn, and in the hay. And we dug in, because we were all frozen, and the hay kept us warm. And there were houses around, you know, private homes not far away. So I guess the SS must have gone in there. 

By that time, we didn't care what's going to happen, if they're gonna throw a match to the barn, because we knew that the Russians, we heard them already, very close. We know either the Russians are going to bomb, and we'll get killed, or, when the Germans, the SS will flee, they'll throw a bomb at us. At that point, we didn't even care one way or another. We were comfortable in the hay, and that's why nobody tried to escape. Because you didn't have any more strength to run. You were lucky and happy to be laying in that particular spot. 

Well, we stayed in that barn for about 24 hours. It was quiet. Suddenly it was very quiet. And we stayed all night, it was quiet. The bombs even stopped. We didn't hear them. And the next morning, it was quiet. 

So little by little, we had already a night's sleep, so we got out like mid-morning, and we went out to look. One went out, and just secretly, it was quiet. We crawled back into, and we waited until nightfall. So in case we'll run out, in case the SS are still around us in the houses, so they won't see us. So we made up our minds that we'll wait until it gets dark. 

When we got-- when it got dark, we got out. And when we got out, we walked each-- you know, we were grouped together, you know. You became a family of the five. So we were three, and two sisters, so we were five. So each one went into the different direction. 

And we got to that, this house, the five of us, and we knocked on the window, figuring in case somebody's inside, they'll come out, so we, we'll go run away. But we knocked on the window and it was quiet. Nobody came out. So we went inside. We walked inside the house. 

At that point we realized that the SS left us. We were on our own. They escaped. The SS took their vehicles and everything and went away. And we were left on our own. I don't know how many hundreds of pe-- women we were left. Not many from all these big group. And we went into the house and, on the table we still found [AUDIO OUT] on the window. 

There was no answer. So we knew the house was empty. And we went in. And we looked through the house, and we found on the table, the food was still warm. So first thing we did is we ate. And we stayed there all that night, and the following day the Russians came in. 

They marched through that town. And we were in that house, hiding. And the Russians knocked on the door, and they came in, and they asked us who we are. And we told them that we were Jews, and that we then, that everyone in the camps and the German, the SS had ran away and left us there. 

And they seemed to didn't understand us. I-- we didn't speak Russian. But amongst them there was one Jewish soldier, a Russian soldier. And he spoke a little bit of Yiddish, so we explained it to him, and he understood. 

And he'll, they left, and they left us there. The Russian soldier. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Was the Jewish soldier surprised? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: When we told him? I really don't know if he was surprised or not. He-- we told him, and he believed us, and they left. They wanted to check out who we were. And we told him. And then they left. 

And we were there for a couple of days. But we couldn't stay there too long, because the Russian soldiers kept on coming into the house and knocking on the windows. And one night, they were really knock-- knocking on the doors, and they came in and they wanted girls. And then he said that we gave it to the Germans, why can't we give it to them, because they liberated us. 

So that same night, we were five girls, we ran away from the house. And we were hiding in the barns. And then we were travelling, we were going back home. And we were walking. And whenever there was a freight car, we used to hop on it. 

And, but most of the time, we were walking at night. In the daytime, we were hiding out. Until I-- we walked all the way to Czechoslovak-- from Poland to Czechoslovakia. I don't know exactly how long it took. But walking through Ger-- you know, Poland, when we got to Lublin, they were already liberated, city was liberated. 

And there was already setup, Jewish, you know, the joint. And they gave us food and clothing, and we were in Warsaw. and we were checking in. They took our names to register that, you know, we were survivors. And that's how we walked. I don't know how many days it took until we got int-- I went home. 

I went to Czechoslovakia, and I came into Ungvar, Uzhhorod. And I found out my sister's friends there, you know, there. My father had a friend of his, and he had a home. And she went there, and I went there, and we were stayed there. 

And from there, I took a train, and I went back home to my home town. Because my father, he told us before we arrived at Auschwitz, that whoever will survive should go home first. And he told us that our neighbor, and he gave some money and some things to hide, that whoever will survive should go there and collect it. 

INTERVIEWER 2: When you went home, did you hope? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Well, when I went home I was hoping maybe somebody got there before me. But the train didn't go all the way. You see, Berezna was, there was a small Berezna, and there was a big Berezna. So the train couldn't go all the way into my town, because the bridge was bombed, so we just walked across, and I walk into my hometown and my neighbor's, which, he was affiliated with the church. He lived right across the street from us. 

And when he saw me walking in to my house, because they lived right across the street from us. I went into the house, and the house was empty. And all the floors were ripped off. The windows were torn off, and the doors were torn. It was all in shambles. There wasn't a speck of anything in the house. 

So I went to-- to the neighbor from the other side, because when my father said that he had given them to hide. So I went to claim it. They were surprised to see me. And, I-- they gave me some of the stuff back, but they said that when the Russians came in-- because Russia liberated that part of Czechoslovakia. So he said, they said, when the Russians came in, and they took everything away. So some of the stuff they came, and I went back to the my own house. And that family they was working. How do you say the cantor? 

He was singing in the church, you know, the service, you know, with the organ. I don't know. Organist, something, but he lived across the street. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: Clergyman. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: He was a clergyman of the church. And when he-- she, his wife came in, and she saw me alone, so she took me into her house. And she gave me food. And being it was late and I couldn't go back, so she asked me to stay overnight in her house. 

And while I was there, she asked me where is the rest of the family is. And I did-- I didn't want to tell them anything. I just told them that I had come into town to collect the things that my father had given to hold. And we are all going to Israel or to the United States. They asked me if-- I didn't tell them that I didn't know. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you realize that you were the only one? 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Yeah. When I came into my hometown. And there was nobody. Nobody was there at all, not, no, any of the Jewish people. I was the first one that had come into. And I only stayed there overnight. I couldn't stay there any longer. They asked me to stay longer. And I told them no, because I'm going back to Uzhhorod because some of my family's going to come, and we're all going away. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So, is that-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And that-- I left that day, and I have never gone back there again. So I went back to Uzhhorod-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: And you realized that time that this-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: That that's it. That I was the only one that had survived. And I stayed in Uzhhorod, my father's friend, you know, and Rosie-- 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: Took her in. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: --took us in. He had an apartment. And I stayed with them. And there was my sister's girlfriend, also, Rosie. We were there together, and we sort of kept house. And we kept ourselves busy. And every once in a while we heard somebody came, after the war survived, and this one and that one. And it went by a while. And nobody, I had never heard, or anything about my rest of the family. 

Until one day, I was sitting by the window. I was mending the socks. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: That's not yet when I came in. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: No. And I was, a friend of mine came in, and he said to me. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: Sylvia, wait. We were-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: I want to hear. 

FRANCIS GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. Go on, Sylvia. 

SYLVIA BRODACH: And so I was sitting by the window. And I heard this person, you know, from my hometown survived, and that one. But I hadn't heard anything about my own immediate family. 

And this friend of mine walks into the room, and he said to me, Sylvia, what are you going to give me? I have a surprise for you. And I was sitting and mending, I said, so I said then, what can you-- what kind of surprise can you bring me? 

And I picked up my hat, and I saw my sister standing in the yard, you know, in the courtyard. So first, I thought I was seeing things. And then she gave a yell, and I ran out in the courtyard. And we both fainted right there on the spot. And that's how I-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: In winter, you know, when we were divided, that I got sick, and typhus, you know. And when I came out of it, my sister was gone, and everybody was gone. And I had to start all over, and I was very weak. 

And then time, the war was coming, and Kaiserwald has to be evacuated, because the Russians was coming. Every night, the big lights were coming in, you know. You could see the whole camp like in daylight. They used to bring all SS women and their families into-- into the lager, because, at that time, we didn't-- couldn't understand why. The whole camp was like daylight. 

And one day we find out in the morning that they-- we going buy a boat someplace. And they took us to Stutthof. We were traveling several days to Stutthof. In Stutthof, we used to-- we had to sleep five in a bed. We got beaten left and right from those kapos, those Polish gentile kapos, they used to call them, you know, they were in every room. They were political-- 

SYLVIA BRODACH: Prisoners? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Prisoners. The women. And they used to beat left and right. You-- Then Mengele came in. You would jump from the window, you jump everywhere. Till one day, they looking for 100 women. And I happened to be in a group. They cut off 100 women, and they took us to Danzig. And in Danzig I worked in a half-- in a-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Harbor. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: --where ships go in, you know, that time, those underground ships. There was, everything was bombed. The whole city was bombed. And I was working in the water, the half, to build way off, there was, you know, the road was all the way, we were standing in the ocean. My whole legs until today were all frozen, because I only had, they only had wooden shoes. 

And we had to stay in the water. And planieren (flatten) and, you know, with those kind of special wood that bent, you know, around, around, and for all the way from the top. And when we finished that whole project, then we had to build telephone poles they making because everything was bombed. And it was so bitter cold. And then we had to take apart bomb factories, and homes, with the bricks. And with wooden things, we used to knock off the cement, you know, like bricks they are from cement, and lay in the blocks. 

My hand used to be all the skin coming out. We didn't have a coat, nothing. We used to take cement, you know, a bag that cement comes in. Putting on the hat. And we were all day long, you know, working. You got wet. It was raining and snowing, and coming in the night in the dark in the barrack we were under-froren (freezing) there. Till the war was coming every night. We heard bombing and bombing. 

And one day we find out that the ship, the Hamburg had called. That they have acquired the whole Danzig, the civilians. The name was Hamburg. Hamburg, the big ship Hamburg was talking all the civilians, and we were helping the ship, taking in all their stuff, what they took. And we were dragging all the bags inside. And they left, and they-- we were starting from there on, to march. They closed up everything. Every night you heard nothing and bombing and daylight was falling here and there. And we were walking. The only thing that we had is a blanket. And we were walking day after day on the road. 

We slept outside on the, on the snow, you know. Pull together all the, the you know, together. And whoever could make it, they'll never get up. Till we came in-- it was going on for a couple of days --and we came in, in a small town. It was like a farm, because, remember the street was narrow. We seen a house here, a house here. It was full of snow. And we came in, also, to a barn. And they let us into a barn. And next morning, somebody wakes up, you know, says you know, there, there's no SS anymore. There is nobody here. 

However, half of the people were dead there. They didn't wake up. And whoever they wake up, they looked out the windows. They came out, you know. And all of a sudden, big tanks coming in, one after a another one, you know. 

And I speak Russian. And I heard one Russian looks out, looks out of the glasses, and he says shto vy ludi o chort. It means what are you, animals? Or, or you know, devils? 

I mean, he, he, you know, the way we looked all skin and bone. Naked and all. And I remember he throwed a bread. And I grabbed it back to my stomach. And with my stomach I pulled myself up. So I was afraid somebody is going to take it away from me, you know. And I put myself into the barn, back, and I ate up that bread, you know. Just too fast, I was also afraid somebody was going to take it away. 

And then we find out that we were liberated, you know. And nobody, nobody cared. We would go, and we go. We were five women. I had one lady from, they were from Transylvania. They only spoke Hungarian and Romanian. And I spoke, you know, Yiddish and Hungarian and Russian. 

And here, we were liberated so we, we were sticking all together, you now. So I remember, we walked and walked. We came in a city. It's called not Ham-- Lumberg. It Was a big city, you know. And we got into a house. And we start-- we had full of lice, everywhere. We were trying to look to wash and wash. And we couldn't get it to go over. 

And in the night, early in the morning, you know, we were, we were afraid. We took a closet and to the door, you know. We were afraid that, you know, something is going to happen, you know, the Germans. We were even thinking that the Russians, we were liberated, but we were still very afraid. And the night, the Russians come and they were looking for girls, you know. We start running from the windows. 

And one girl, she was about 17 years old, she was shot because, you know, they-- we were running away. So I was left only with two. One middle-aged woman, and one was like mine age. 

And from them on there, we were going every day walking and walking. And we slept and the bomb-- you know it was tanks and cars. And we were sleeping there. Finally we find out it's called a Kommandatura. So the girls, I told the girls to stay outside. And I, because I speak a little Russian, Ukrainian. Czech, it's a Slavic language, I could. 

So I remember, I came into a kommandatura. And I tried to tell them that I'm ya yevrey means, you know, Russian. That I'm Jewish, and I just came along, and I need a bumashka, paper. The war is going on. That we are going home. I'm from Czechoslovakia. 

And he says to me, shto to by khadit do voj, budesh kholod. You know, and this speak. And I recognized, I understood something is wrong. So I called right away for them in Hungarian. The girls was waiting for me outside, that means get going, you know what I mean, that there's no-- that something is not right here. 

So we got lost. And from there on, we were walking, walking in the night. Till we came in to Rozwadow. In Rozwadow, in the meantime, you know, we accumulated some-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. In the meantime, did you think that-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Never with nobody. We were walking, you know? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Walking about 20, 25 kilometer. Whatever got dark in the night, we run into a home-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Where? Where were you going? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: On the street. We didn't know where we going. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Which direction? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I didn't know. We were just going one place. We were, you know, three girls together. There were nobody there. We were just walking along, whenever the night hit. We didn't know where we were going. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you think that anyone in your family-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I was just wanted to go home. I just wanted to go home. We didn't have no direction. We were afraid of everything. So by the road, you know, little by little, we was just walking. In the night, we-- wherever we-- fell the night in, we start there. We went into a home. We found something to eat. And we slept, you know, outside, because we were afraid to be in the house. And every morning, we were going about 25, 30 barefoot, you know? 

Because the wooden shoes was already torn up, you know? And then finally, we came into one house and we find there are dead German. And we took-- I took out the pair of shoes, and everybody tried to get up in their shoes, because we had all blisters, and we were all frozen. [INAUDIBLE]. And I walked for days. I don't remember how many days. 21 day-- I remember we were coming in to-- it's called Rozwadow, a city that was bombed. And we had to go the other side. 

As we came close, we see Polish people, you know? So I was afraid to say that I'm Jewish because I know what the poles, what they were doing-- the gentiles-- to the Jewish people. So, you know, I made myself, you know, a cross right here, you know? And I start talking Czech. And Czech and Polish is very-- it's similar. I could understand what they were saying, they couldn't understand so much what I was saying, but I could communicate with them. 

And I remember there was a guy. And we made a bargain, sort of. I give him a golden watch that I found. And he's going to talk us, with a little boat, across Rozwadow, though, because it was bombed. And we were three girls-- my two friends and myself. And we were in the middle of the water. And all of sudden, he says he wants to have more money. I told him I had it hidden someplace, wait till I get other side. 

And when I came other side, I start-- you know, we started a fight. I wasn't afraid. He You was starting a fight. And all of a sudden, the Enkavide Russian came in, you know? I keep telling them that I'm a yevrey. I could tell them all day long. They locked us up. They finally, from-- there was already-- in Lublin, was a Jewish comrade. And somehow-- I don't know how it got spread out that there was girls locked up. They claimed to be from Lager. 

So the Russians listened to us and they let us free. They give us kaloni you know, that we could buy food. And from them on-- so we had a bumashka, a piece of paper, that we are yevreys, and we are from Czechoslovakia. We are going home. 

So I traveled through Krasno, Rozwadow, till I came into Lublin. In Lublin was already a committee. You know what I mean? So you start looking people-- go left, right, this from this camp, the other one from other camp. 

And everybody was telling, have you see my mother? Have you seen my father? Have you seen my sister? Have you seen someone from Brezno? You know, have you seen my cousin? You know, everybody was busy, running, looking for themselves, you know? And I traveled through, all the way till Uzhhorod like that. You know, open trains-- trains that was carrying big bulk of tress. You know, we were on the top of them, we were going. Or on the top of the tree-- of the train, in the top. 

And we were going up to Chop. And Chop is the krizovatka. You know, where all the trains-- if you want to go in, the crossroad, kind of. And so I came in. You know, a man approaches. And he says, aren't you Kaplowitz's daughter? And I said, yes. I said, why are you bothering me, you know? He says, didn't you have a sister? I said, don't you know I had a sister? We were so many kids, you know. Everybody was so nervous, you know? 

Telling me, you know-- because everybody was asking, have you seen my wife? Have you seen my mother? You know? And everybody-- I said, why are you bothering me? He said, didn't you have a sister? I said, yes. Your sister is alive. My sister is alive? Where? You know? I start tearing the man apart. And he says, she's in Uzhhorod. And he was going to Uzhhorod to ride on the train. I was wishing, the train all the way to Uzhhorod. Finally, we came into Uzhhorod. 

And I was walking the front. The man couldn't keep up with me to show me which house my sister's in. And I-- he came into a house. He says, this is the house. And then I came in, I opened the door, and there like a big yard. And I look and I see outside of a big window. And my sister had no hair. And she was turning, like this. She was sewing. I only see her profile, like that. Then I came to the door, and I just screamed out her name, Sylvia! 

Then all the people came in from everywhere. Then I grabbed and both fell down. And this is the way we found each other. Then I went into the house. It was a wreck. [CRYING] And we start talking. OK, where-- there was nobody there, but only the two of us. And she was telling me that she was already at home-- where we were born-- and she didn't find nobody there. 

You know, I told her that I made myself a promise-- if I happen to be alive, I have to go to my-- my home, where I was born. She said, don't go there. Don't go, there's nothing there. But I had to go. You couldn't stop me. She begged me not to go. I said no, surely, I got to go. I made myself a promise. As I was going alone, the bridge was-- the bridge was bombed. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Why did you go? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I went from Uzhhorod, to the train, till Little Berezne. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But why did you want to go? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I want to go home, where I was born, where I lived. And I got to see it one more time. So I took a train up to Little Berezne. And the bridge was bombed and you got to walk about an hour and a half or so to till Wielkie Berezne, where I was from. And I walk, I walk, and I came into town. I just wanted to kill everybody who kept in my place. I couldn't face nobody. I couldn't face. 

I was walking from up the street till I came to the house where I was born. And there was not-- I went to the house-- to a house with my father. And everything was torn apart. Everything was taken apart, everything was not left. I went to the yard, when I was there, and I was just beating the ground. I just couldn't get myself together. Then they come-- the gentile people, the neighbors, you know? They came and I just wanted to kill everybody. 

I just wanted to take revenge. I just felt, when I come in there, I'll just tear them apart. There was already a family living there, in Velky Berezny. My friends, they told me, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. They were holding me. Don't do that. And everybody was coming around. And where my father is? And I didn't give them the satisfaction to tell him that they dead. I told him they're alive, they're all in Budapest. They win. I came just came here alone. 

They-- I couldn't give them the satisfaction to tell them that they are dead, that nobody came back. I couldn't tell them. I couldn't tell them. I didn't want them to get the revenge. And I seen people there like-- You go to those offices. Those people were killing and they were back, again, in charge-- all of them. And I slept only one night there. And I left back to Uzhhorod where my sister is. And then I had those two friends from Transylvania. 

And we went looking all over. Some says, you see my father? Somebody said, you seen my brother? We were going all over, checking. And from Bucharest, the transport. So Because were in Bucharest. And we got from the Czechoslovakian Committee a paper. I still have it. And they give us money and they give us medication. And they told us that we'll be, later, all right. 

And we are looking for everywhere to find the family, till we came back and we didn't find nobody. In the meantime, the Russians came already over. And I told my sister that I'm not going be nowhere where Russian are. So we packed up, and we go, and travel back to Czechoslovakia. So in the meantime, we already had, from the Czech console, a little money. So we bought a little suitcase, and we bought some clothes, and we got ourselves together-- me, my sister, and my girlfriend. 

And we were traveling from Budapest. We were going to Prague. In Budapest, Bratislava-- you know, the Russians, in the night. And we were have the couple suitcases sitting on the back of us. So my girlfriend says, let's put it onto the knees because they were stealing left and right. And I said, no, let's put in the back. Because we were sitting like this in the wood-- in the train, you know? It was dark, there was no light. 

We could feel the suitcases in the back. And that's the way it was. We were shaking, like this. In the morning, we came into Bratislava. We woke up. Everything was gone. Everything. We only had what we had on ourselves. I told my sister, I'm going to kill myself. It's no use fighting. It's no use. I had enough. And they were all pulling me, you know? And finally, we got ourselves together. And we didn't have nothing. We were just three without nothing. 

Just what we had ourself. We came into Prague, you know what I mean? We didn't have where to go. We were sitting in the waiting room in Prague. And here, we were so hungry. We didn't have nothing. My sister was fainting. Then came the Red Cross. And they took us to the charita. The charita was a repatriace place with all-- all-- all people gather together, you know, looking one for another. 

And they kept us for a while. In that time, I-- while they were taking care of her-- and I find a person who was in the same Lager. They were telling me that my cousin is in Teplice-Sanov, in a hospital. So I left my sister there, and I got into the train, and I came into Teplice-Sanov. And I came to Teplice-Sanov, I find, for a Langsman a person from Velky Berezny. He was already a volunteer. 

In 1944, there was a free army from General Svoboda accomplished, and it got together in London. And he was in that army. And he says, yes, your cousin was here, but she went back home. Now when we were crossing ourselves, you know, she also went back to Wielkie Berezne and wanted to see her-- her home. And that time, he tells me-- he says, listen, you know, come here. And you'll get something to do here. So I went back from Prague and I brought my sister from the sanatorium. 

At that time, she was already well. And we came into Teplice-Sanov. We were very hungry. We went into-- it's a place-- like a community. And we got tickets for food, you know? Because everything in 1945-- you know, I was liberated March, the 10th. I was liberated March the 10th. And I came home in June. I think it was June. It took me that long to come home. And that time, you know, a lot of people were already liberated. And in June-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: When did you realize that no one is really alive besides from your-- 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Because when I came home, my sister was dead. I never thought of anyway She's going to live it through, because she was so young and so little. And we came home. And there, nobody came. I seen this was coming on somebody else. And we were waiting in Uzhhorod for a couple of weeks. And we went to-- you know, somebody said, did you see my father? And then my father had ulcers. And my father went with my brother, who was after me. 

My mother went with that 8 year old, 10, and 12. And my brother, who was after me, went with my father. And I went with my sister. I kind of felt that my father had ulcers that he-- but my brother. He was so healthy. He was such a healthy boy. He was [INAUDIBLE]. And he was young. It was such a healthy-- I couldn't accept it. [SOBBING] 

And later, we find out what did they do with the kids-- made them be lined up, that they were all burned. We heard that-- we met with many people-- that they were killing the people in Auschwitz, women and children. We already knew everything. Well, I couldn't accept my brother. My brother-- it couldn't be. He was very young. And we were going from place to place. Somebody says, he was working here, in a coal mine. And somebody says, with my father-- we couldn't accept. 

And we wanted to get away fast. We didn't want to ever remember everybody. We didn't have nobody-- me and my sister. And we didn't have anywhere to go. We was sleeping in the train station. And we were so hungry. That was already 1945. And when I came in to Teplice-Sanov, that man took us in. My sister came and then we went to register that we could stay there. And then they give us tickets for food. 

And I have to sell the tickets to get money to buy the bread, because I didn't have the money to buy the bread for the tickets that they gave us. And then we went there. And we ate. I took an onion I bought and we fried it. And with bread-- that was what we was eating everyday. And we didn't know what to do. We didn't-- I didn't finish school. I didn't have nothing. I didn't have anywhere to go. And then he brought there-- one day, he brought in another man, who was also in that Svoboda army. 

And he introduced me to him, you know? And I got to know that man. He was 20 years older from me. And we didn't have anywhere to go. And I married that man. Then we should have a home with my sister. And that's the way I stayed in Teplice-Sanov. And I was married in October, the 6th. From June, you know? And then I married October, the 6th in Teplice-Sanov. 

And there's where I lived till-- all of a sudden, came the new law out that all the people who came back from-- from the Karpaty, they going to ship them back because they couldn't apply for citizenship, because the Karpaty, they belong to Russia. 

The Russians took it over. So that means my husband already was automatically accepted because he was in the free willing army under the General Svoboda. But my sister couldn't have been. They wanted to ship her back there. 

INTERVIEWER 2: To Russia? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: To Karpaty, where we were born. That part, the Russians took. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I understand. The Russian's occupied it. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: And then came-- all my cousins came later on, too, because they find out that I am in Teplice-Sanov. And they were-- when they were trying to close the border, everybody was running. Then all my cousins-- five of them-- came to Teplice-Sanov. I was already married. And they stayed with me. We all stayed together. And when they find out that they going to ship them-- so everything had to go in the night. 

One night, my sister tells me that, you know, in a way she-- and I was already pregnant with my-- with-- and they have to run. And she left me again. And she was going on the black border back to Germany. You know, she wanted to go to the United States. You know, to the camps. So she went back. And I was left alone because I was pregnant and I couldn't-- I couldn't go again, you know, in the Lagers being in that situation. 

So I was left alone. And I lived-- I lived in Teplice-Sanov from 1945 to 1949. And in 1949, the Russians start taking over. They came in, in Czechoslovakia, you know? In the meantime, my sister went already to America with a children's transport. Because we had an American-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: But when did you get out? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I left the last transport. We applied-- we couldn't get to come to America because our family-- nobody done nothing to it. My father had two brothers here, and my mother had two brothers here, and nobody cared. And the last minute, we applied to Israel and to Australia-- wherever-- because the Russians was coming. And I told myself that I'll never be in a place where the Russian is. 

So when they coming in, we left everything and we got the Visa. We came to Israel. We came to Israel. We left Czechoslovakia in 1945-- '49. And that was March-- April. Because we had to be in Italy. We came in from Czechoslovakia to Italy. We had to be a month in Italy, till we got the ship Jerusalem, going into Israel. In the meantime, I was-- we lived in Israel for eight years. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And Israel was already Israel? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. That was right after the war, in 1949. OK. That was in 1949. And I remember when we got there-- April or May-- because I remembered that Passover was on the train going from Prague to Italy. We were going by train. And I knew that this is-- so it must be around March, April. And we had to stay in Trani-- the city of Trani-- for a month, till-- you know, there were a lot of people coming-- till they put us together in the ship Jerusalem. And we came in. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember arriving in Israel? 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. I remember very good. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember the night that the ship arrived? Just arrived-- the arrival. 

FRANCES GOLDSTEIN: I remembered when I came, early in the morning. They said they see arrive. They were starting singing that song, Galyat Haifa. And I told-- my daughter was already, that time, nine years old. And I told her that never again-- never again-- is anybody going to tell her, you dirty Jew. That she's going to be here, in a place that is hers. I promised her that. And I stood there. And we came into Israel. And I lived there for eight years-- eight happy years. 

Very hard, very hard, very hard, very hard, but very good. Except, you know, with Arabs-- this and that was going on. And then my kids didn't have nobody. Everywhere was a sister or a brother, and my sister was so far away. And my kids-- I used to talk to them all the time. What happened to us? Since they were a baby-- both of them. My son was born in Israel. And he was four years old. We took a train from Tel Aviv to go to the zoo. 

And we left the Hadera. And he seen an old lady in the train. And he points out, like this. He says, was Hitler there, I see there a grandmother. Everybody-- everybody turned around to see where it's coming from. Because I was talking to my kids all the time what I been through, what we went through, what we paid a price, what we lost-- day after night. They were growing up with that all the time. And they missed-- I had only one sister left and she was in American. 

And I didn't see her. Once, my sister gave me a telephone call from America. For a whole week, I was just laying down. I wanted to her echo in my ear. I only said, Sylvia. And she called my name. And I-- I just closed my eyes. I wanted to hear the echo over and over again. For so long, I didn't do nothing. I just wanted to hear the echo of her voice. Her voice. That we [INAUDIBLE]. We were-- my kids didn't have no family. Nothing. 

And I wanted to be together some-- till they made up the papers. And we came to America. I didn't see my sister for 12 years.
