[ELECTRONIC BEEP] INTERVIEWER 1: the barber. 

SUBJECT: No, we left it off around 11:30. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I understand. Let's proceed again from what happened in the morning. I would like to draw your attention that you, from time to time, look at this-- this is the camera. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK, you speak to us, but speak to her, too. 

SUBJECT: Oh, I see. Darf ich... could I have a little tape for my son? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Uh, we-- let, let him call us later on, Mrs., uh-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah? 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK, there's a possibility, but we have to do it. 

SUBJECT: Mm, yeah. Interesting story, yeah? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah, mhm. But you remember, you are in Berlin, you're in February, 19-- 10, 1940-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: 1944. 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Or where were you-- 

[CLEARING THROAT] 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: OK, So you can begin again. It was in the morning-- 

SUBJECT: Yes, in the morning. So he said he wants to visit me, and-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Your husband said-- 

SUBJECT: Yes, and he run away. Now, I'd like to mention to you how the Gestapo worked. And the next-- the same morning I went to work to excuse myself-- I could not come to work today, because our other people who live with me, they were picked up by the Gestapo, and I would like to have my check. 

So I was told, we don't have your check. The check is in the main office. A light came up to me-- halt, you better run. The Gestapo notified Siemans Zentral that I came for the check. Can you see how they worked? 

So I run away. They would arrest me, right away. 

INTERVIEWER 2: If you had gone to the main office-- 

SUBJECT: Sure. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You would be arrested. 

SUBJECT: But I was smarter than they. 

[LAUGHTER] 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: And now, life is in hiding. 

INTERVIEWER 1: From February 11, 1943? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, yes. No, actually, February 10, from this day until April 24, 1945. This was my happiest day. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Tell us about life in hiding, from the first day. 

SUBJECT: From the first day. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you walked in. 

SUBJECT: Yeah, I lived-- there was a blind man, and he had two rooms. I had one room. In another room he had a young Czech. And he knew, probably, there must be something wrong with me-- I'm staying there. 

So he thought-- he said to me-- because we listened always to radio, BBC, so we knew what's going on in the world. So he said to me, oh, your husband is in England, on BBC? So I said, yes. 

And the funniest thing-- my neighbor was a young couple, and this man was a guard in the prison in Plotzensee, where they killed all the people, executed them-- because I saw it, now, in Berlin, when I was. 

And one time-- I used to run away, always. I used to go out twice a week in the street. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you find this man, the blind man? 

SUBJECT: My husband has connections, has many friends. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh. 

SUBJECT: And through his friends, he found this man. And this lady, the neighbor, used to come in. One time she came in, and I run into my room. And she said to me, you don't have to run away. 

She knew there is something wrong with me, but I don't know if they knew that I am Jewish, yes? I don't know. And when the war was over-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you have another name, or what? 

SUBJECT: No, they, they called me by my-- Elsie, Elsie-- my first name, not thing here. They did not know what I am doing there, I don't know. But they knew there must be something wrong there. What I am doing for-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You didn't go out to work, you didn't have a family name? 

SUBJECT: Nothing, nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So what-- 

SUBJECT: I was a nobody, I was a nobody. One week, I stayed in Berlin, and the other week I went to Zunft. This was a-- not-- a resort. And this lady-- my husband worked for this man. 

You know what he did? When a house was bombed out, they picked up the safes. His boss was a safe cracker. And he knew who he is, but the people who worked with him, they did not know about him. 

And he had a home in the resort. And this lady, she always said to me, come stay with us. And my husband warned me, don't go there, because she-- they had, first, one Jewish girl, she was hidden there, and she reported her. 

But she liked me. So he said, don't you go. Only once a week, she's waiting for you, and her daughter and her two small grandchildren. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You lived in that apartment with a blind man-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --for the two years? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you would go out twice a week. 

SUBJECT: --a week, yeah. I used to go twice a week-- on a Wednesday, on a Fri-- I used to sneak out during the time-- in Berlin at that time, they used to close the stores from 1:00 until 3:00. I used to sneak out like a thief. 

That nobody sees me too often that they get suspicious what I am doing there. And I used to come back home at 10:00 at night. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And where did you stay during-- 

SUBJECT: Oh, I had other friends. Yes, as I mentioned, in our building, there was a-- hmm, he was an Aryan, and he was married to a Jewish lady. But she was dead, and they had two children-- a boy-- the boy, they sent to London, and the daughter remained with the father. 

And they were very friendly to me. I used to go there. They used to give me to eat, always. Yeah, and the first time when I went there, she said to me, oh, what are you doing here, I thought they picked you up. 

So I said, I was not home. And then she said, it's funny, the signs from the Judische Gemeinde, they are ripped off. Somebody must have been in the apartment. 

So I said, I don't know, maybe it was the Super who did it. 

[LAUGHTER] 

But later on, I told her, I was the Super. I went in and took out whatever was possible for me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, the people you visited were this daughter of the-- 

SUBJECT: Of the-- yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --Aryan. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That lady in the resort. 

SUBJECT: It was a different one, yeah. That was a-- no, no, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you went out twice a week, where did you go? 

SUBJECT: Yes, I had another old lady. And she gave me-- some times I stayed home over night, yeah-- and she gave me to eat. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Who was she? Who was this old lady? 

SUBJECT: She lived not far from me where I was hidden, yes. I used to go to this one, one day. And sometimes, I used to go to them. They had a store. It was the biggest store of bicycles in Berlin. 

And I had there a suitcase-- in-- hid-- my personal clothes, yeah, better clothes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And how did you know-- get to know her, this lady? 

SUBJECT: No, because-- which one? 

INTERVIEWER 2: The older lady. 

SUBJECT: The older lady? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah, how did you get to know her, to be able to go to her house? 

SUBJECT: Oh, I knew her from before. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And those are German Aryans? 

SUBJECT: Aryans, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who knew that you were a Jew? 

SUBJECT: Oh, yes. Yes, they helped me. They were still weise. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they speak to you openly? 

SUBJECT: Oh, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What? 

SUBJECT: They tried to help me, that's all. They gave me to eat. I got food. Because we had to buy on the black market. We did not have any food stamps anymore. We had to buy it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where was the black market? 

SUBJECT: Oh, there was in Berlin, still were black-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where? How did you find it? 

SUBJECT: As I said, my husband had many connections, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you get food for the whole week? That's-- 

SUBJECT: Well, I did not eat much. There wasn't-- and then my husband had-- one time he helped a young man to buy a bakery, so he provided him with bread and cake. 

And potatoes, we could buy without stamps. And then we had two other friends. They were Jewish ladies. They were married to Gentiles, so they helped us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you met all these people throughout-- 

SUBJECT: We knew them, yeah before. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You met them-- 

SUBJECT: From before. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh, so you met them literally throughout the war, between 1943 and 1945? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You would come in openly into their apartment? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Sit down, have your tea or coffee-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And talk. 

SUBJECT: They gave you always food, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Talk about what? 

SUBJECT: Talk about-- well, first, from they-- there were two sisters, Jewish ladies, and they were married to Aryans. And they looked at me when I told them the Gestapo wanted to pick me up yesterday-- I am now in hiding. 

They looked at me and said, I am a criminal. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: Because their brother was a good friend of my husband, and he was picked up later on. Oh, on February 28, they picked up the last, the remaining Jews from Berlin from the factories. 

INTERVIEWER 1: February 28, 1943? 

SUBJECT: Yes, yes, February 28. And then my husband had a friend, and he was still working. He was still there on the 28th. And he said, when he heard, all of the sudden, like, a big truck is stopping in front of the factory. 

And he wore a white coat, with, naturally, the patch you had. He took off that coat and run and hid himself into the German toilet room. And then he ran away after it quieted down. 

After they picked up all the people, he went home, and he went into hiding, too. He survived. 

Then I'd like to mention another thing about our eh, Judische Gemeinde-- completed their work, right? And then they thought they are safe. No. At the end of May, 1943, the Judische Gemeinde was picked up. 

And that was the end of the Jews-- was Judenrein. They want to make Judenrein. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, when you walked out-- 

SUBJECT: Yes, from where? 

INTERVIEWER 1: From your apartment-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were there never controls, check of papers? 

SUBJECT: No, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were never stopped? 

SUBJECT: No, I was lucky. No. It was worse for men, yes. For men was worse. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you were never stopped to identify yourself? 

SUBJECT: No, I did not have any papers. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were your afraid? 

SUBJECT: I was a nobody. No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you passed soldiers or policemen, what did you feel? 

SUBJECT: I was frightened. Yes, the first two weeks, I was very scared, because they said the Gestapo has our pictures. And one time I had a terrible incident. 

When I think of it, my heart is jumping, again, because I was walking-- it was the day when I used to go out from my hiding place. And all of the sudden, a man with a swastika button approached me. 

And I thought, oh, now, this is my end is coming. And I started to walk very fast. And I thought, any minute, he will grab me. No, he probably was looking for an acquaintance. 

[LAUGHTER] 

And I walked so fast, I don't know. And later on, I turned to home, and he was not there. But I still was so frightened in the evening, when I came back home. I thought maybe this man is waiting somewhere for me-- no. It was a terrible experience. 

And to live in hiding is-- eh, I was waiting for my death. I escaped death four times-- four times. How? Well, the first time when I came home was one time. 

And a second time, I was-- it was shortly before the Russians came to Berlin. I left my hiding place, and a cousin of mine was hidden, too. I intended to go there. We were supposed to have some dinner. 

And then, they were shoot-- the Russians were shooting Berlin. I did not know what happened, and I saw all the police and saw they threw themselves on the floor. So I did it, too. 

And then I was on my way to my cousin's, and my husband was there, hidden in one other place, and he was standing outside. And he said to me, what are you doing here? 

So I said, I'm going to dinner. We have a dinner. So he said, don't you know what happened? The Russians are almost here. So I could not go. So I stayed there. 

And one time he went to-- uh, uh, no-- Steglitz-- it's, like, here, Riverdale, let's say, to get some food. And this was during the day. The English, the British, used to come in the, uh daytime. No, the Americans used to come. Oh, it was beautiful. 

I knew, it can be my end, too. But it's closer to the end. The Americans used to come at 11:30, only for a half hour. And they razed a few blocks, and they did it-- this started in February, 1945. 

And they did it systematically from the start. When they finished the following day, they continued. And this did go on and on. It was nice. And one-- that day, when I wanted to see my cousins, and my husband says, you cannot go there, anymore, the Russians are already here. 

Don't you hear the shooting? So I said, yes. So I stayed there, and he went to uh, another part of Berlin, to Steglitz, to the baker, to get some bread and cake. 

And the Americans came and a bomb fell down where I was sitting, but it did not explode. So I escaped death a second time. 

[LAUGHTER] 

Now, they used to-- when the Russ-- later on, the soldiers, when they came on furlough, they did not go back. When they caught them, they hanged them on a tree. Yes. 

So this way to discourage the people not to do it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Not desert? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. And there was a resistance group in Berlin, too. And they used to write on churches-- "Nieder Mit Hitler." And so-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You saw it? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What year was it? 

SUBJECT: Well, that was shortly before the end, where I was hidden, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Nieder Mit Hitler? 

SUBJECT: Nieder Mit Hitler, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you feel, seeing that. 

SUBJECT: What I felt? I was happy. I thought the end is approaching. It can be my end, too, because I was waiting for my dad every day. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why? 

SUBJECT: Why? I could get killed by the bombs, or eventually, you could get caught by the Gestapo. That's how I-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, you said that the first two weeks were frightening? 

SUBJECT: Yes. Later on I got used to it. Nobody knew who I am. I did not have anymore my patch. I was among the people, and so on, so-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you spoke to strangers? 

SUBJECT: Oh, sometimes. They were all frightened. I had always a bag with me. Uh, I had some change of clothes and a pair of shoes. I had, in my heel-- opened up my heel-- and put in my mother's rings. 

I could not wear the shoe-- it was, the heel was loose, but I had it with me. Yeah. And when the people, they always, when they saw me, I have a bag-- where are they, where are they? They used to-- know, ask me, did, uh, the Americans are already on their way for others. 

So I said, I don't know. I'm going to visit somebody only. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They asked about your bag? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. No, when they saw me, I have a bag-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Oh. 

SUBJECT: I am going to a bunker? So I said, no, I'm not going to the bunker. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A bunker is? 

SUBJECT: A bunker for where they were hidden. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A bunker. 

INTERVIEWER 2: A bunker. 

SUBJECT: Bunker, yeah. And during the bombings, yeah. I remember I could hear how the buildings are crashing. You could hear the bricks falling down. And the people, they put on, eh, blankets on their heads, not to hear that. 

I was happy. 

[LAUGHTER] 

It might be my-- I knew the end is coming, because it was every day worse and worse. But I was happy. Let them have the taste what we went through. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you make any new friends, acquaintances, walking around anonymously? 

SUBJECT: No, I did not bother with anybody, only because I was a criminal still. No, no. Only when they asked me, where are they? They're, hm, (FINGER SNAP) no-- the bombers. So I said, I don't know it. I'm going to visit somebody. I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hm, they thought you were running away? 

SUBJECT: And sirens-- yeah, yes, yes. And then we did not have the water, and oh-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many people do you think in Berlin knew of your existence altogether? 

SUBJECT: I don't understand your question. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How many non-Jews, how many Germans-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --knew that you existed in Berlin? How many people knew of you? 

SUBJECT: Hm, maybe about ten. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That's all? 

SUBJECT: That's all, that's all, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Ten non-Jews, not more? 

SUBJECT: No, nuh uh. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The blind man-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --knew or didn't know? 

SUBJECT: And his friends, they used to come. And other people who were hidden used to come to him, too. And I remember one couple came there one time, and we were afraid of our Jewish friends, too. 

They should not know that I lived there. Then often, they used to come to visit him. I used to say, I'm going home, now. And I used to go to the kitchen, and I was waiting until they left. That was life. Isn't that nice? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, it is two years. 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you notice? In 1943, Germany was still in good shape. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They were, they were still way into Russia, and-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you notice happening, over time, outside? How did the Germans change? 

SUBJECT: The Germans, they are waiting. Yeah, they had-- we had even jokes about the Gestapo. Eh, there is an air raid, and a Gestapo man takes his jacket. Quick, he hears the si-- siren. 

Where are they, where are they? I think they were waiting already for the end, too, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: They were fed up. It was too much. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When, when did that begin? In 1943, I, I think? 

SUBJECT: No, no, no. 1945. No, 1943 was always, "Der Sieg ist unser." No, 1943. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And you saw no difference in the Germans between 1943 and 1945? 

SUBJECT: Yes, 1943, they were frightened, because of the bombings, you know. 

INTERVIEWER 2: In 194--? 

SUBJECT: 1943--eh, 1945, 

INTERVIEWER 2: 1945? 

SUBJECT: 1945, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Before 1945, you didn't see any difference in the way the Germans behaved or acted? 

SUBJECT: No, no, no. It the same thing. After usually, after eh, hm, air raid-- you know, officers, they'd keep their mouths shut. Goebbels used to make an announcement. You'd get a special ration-- a quarter pound of chocolate. So they'd keep their mouths shut. 

And we had, ahem-- they were a joke. There is now a new newspaper, and 60 million people subscribed. They call it The Schnauzer. The Schnauzer, it's for an animal, you call, a schnauzer-- it's a mouse. 

Eh, 60 million subscribe it. 5 million-- the remaining 5 million-- because there was that population of Germans-- 65 million. 5 million are outsiders, so-- the 5 million were, uh, opposing Hitler. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: Yes, but otherwise they were all for him. Yes, they were enthusiastic. Even the Russians were there. They were still fighting and had Goebbels made a speech-- "Der Sieg ist unser." 

Another thing-- they made gas-- eh, they knew that the end is coming. They are losing. So they made something like gas pipes all over Berlin. Then they said, if you go under, the city will go under, too. 

But it was unexpectedly, they did not have the time anymore to open up the gas pipes. So they would-- we would be dead by the Nazis. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, in those two years-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --you did not see-- did you see any deportations, any clue, anything else happened? 

SUBJECT: No, it was over. The deputation was over, 1943. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were there, eh, further-- 

SUBJECT: Oh, yes. Yes, yes. There was one girl. She walked by Siemens und Halske. They called her Stella. And she was picked up to take her to Auschwitz. But one SS man told her, we save your life, but give us names of people that you know. 

And through her, maybe they deported about 100 persons who were hidden because of her. Oh, she was terrible. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And she survived? 

SUBJECT: She survived. When the war was over, they were-- almost lynched her, sure. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. Did you ever go by a synagogue when you were in hiding, or a Jewish place? 

SUBJECT: No, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You didn't see any-- 

SUBJECT: I avoided it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You avoided it. 

SUBJECT: No, and then there was the Gestapo building. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes? 

SUBJECT: We were afraid to go by, because sometimes, the guards grabbed somebody-- a Jew who passed by, yes-- no. This building doesn't exist anymore, now, the Gestapo. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Could it-- over the three years, did you forget who you were? You were a German, you were in hiding. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you, for some time, perhaps, stop thinking that you were-- 

SUBJECT: I always stopped thinking. I was only thinking, waiting for my dad, every day. That was my feeling. 

[LAUGHTER] 

INTERVIEWER 2: When you would walk from the blind man's house-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: --to where you were going-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: --did you walk-- did you go from this point to that point? Or did you go around a bit? Or did you always go-- 

SUBJECT: No, I walked straight, because in the street the people did not know me. I was only afraid of the neighbors, that eventually, they'd pay any attention to me, and they'd get suspicious if they will see me often. Therefore, I sneaked out. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you sneak out? Did you go at a special time, or did you-- 

SUBJECT: Yes, at the time when the stores were closed, so it was all quiet. I listened, nobody goes out, and then I walked out, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And once you were out past the neighbors, you felt safer? 

SUBJECT: I felt safer, yeah. And another time, I almost paid, gave my life, too. I was on my way to Mr. Hellmann's place, where he had the bicycle store. I had, there, a suitcase with my clothes. 

And there was an air raid. I was closer to get there. And then something like an inner voice tells me, don't go there. And I followed. I went to the other old lady. 

And I saved my life, because they threw a bomb, and the father of that girl was killed, that went to the building, yeah. So I-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: I escaped that, again. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you ever stop and think, during the years, why these particular Germans would help you? Did you ever give it any thought? 

SUBJECT: Yes. Uh, therefore, I must say, I cannot blame all the Germans, because they were against Hitler. Therefore, they did it. 

INTERVIEWER 2: That's-- 

SUBJECT: That's, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: That's why you think they helped you? 

SUBJECT: Yes, yes. Otherwise, we would not survive. There were, according to the statistics from Judische Gemeinde, there were 10,000 Jews hidden in Berlin-- 10,000. 

And 1,800 survived only. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The rest? 

SUBJECT: The rest were ki-- caught by the Gestapo or killed by the bombs. That's it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What about liberation? It was over. 

SUBJECT: Oh, the liberation? It was-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did-- 

SUBJECT: That was-- yes. Eh, it was in the afternoon. We were in that place that was-- that time, my husband was in this place. He was a friend of his, too. He had an upholstery. 

But he was not there. He had a home in a resort. So during the bombing, he stayed there. And my husband watched his place, because where he worked for that safe cracker, this was bombed out. 

So he had no place to go, so he went there. And what I wanted to say? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Liberation. 

SUBJECT: Oh, yes. And the people all were outside. And they said-- oh, one man came in and said, I just saw Russians coming in. And the Russian-- the German soldiers were still eating. They threw away their, eh, rifles. And they ran, they escaped. 

And then the elite Russians came. Oh, they were nice. And I spoke Russian. And they did not believe me that I am Jewish. So they said, that's not true. They're-- all the Jews are killed. 

So I said, no, there are still some alive. And I said-- and the Germans, the women, they offered them liquor, something. They did not-- they did not touch anything, because they were afraid eventually they'd poison them. 

And I said to one of them, oh, you are so nice. So he said, yes, we are nice. We are the elite troops. But what comes after us is not nice. It's not good. The Mongolians came. Oh, they were terrible. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Let's stay with the Germans. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did they-- did you feel differently for the-- about the Germans when you were free? Did you speak differently? Did you tell people anything? 

SUBJECT: But that time, yes. They did not know yet who I am. Only when the Russians came. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes. 

SUBJECT: Then we told them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You told whom? 

SUBJECT: The people who lived in the building where my husband was staying, yes. And then, we had-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do remember the meeting when you told them and what their response was? 

SUBJECT: Yes. We had two shelters. We had the big shelter where they all stayed. And then the Russians came, and they raped the women. So they said how it happened. 

And we had another friend from the building, about four people. And they stayed with us. How it happened-- nothing happens in your place. We will come for-- to stay with you. Or you come-- so I said, I cannot-- I spoke Russian. 

So I said, I cannot protect you. You want to come here? All right, so here, we will leave. That's how it was. And the Russians, they picked up quick-- word frau-- where is frau, frau? 

They're looking for women. They were drunk, too. So I said, wherever you go, you go to your right or to your left, you find them. There's no problem for you. Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You will find the Russians, they will rape you? 

SUBJECT: Yes, yes. You know, I spoke to the Russians. I told them, you got to the right side or to the left, wherever you go, there are always German woman-- women, whatever you want. That was liberation. 

And I must say, this was the happiest day of my life. Now, I am safe. There is no more Hitler, and so on. But they were-- fighting were still going on for about a week. 

And Goebbels used to say still, "Der Sieg ist unser." They were fighting. And even the Russians, they did not know eventually, they have to leave Berlin. Eventually, the Russian-- the Germans come over then. 

That was in the Commandant tour. And I went with one Major, and to the stores, and to tell them to open up the stores and make a-- hm, inventory, like in the bakery-- how much, eh, flour you have. 

Then you get, we like to bring life to normal. But when Goebbels said-- eventually, the Russians, they said-- it was opposite where I stayed at, in the buildings. Then they say, all right, if we leave-- as long as you see lights in our building, it's all right. 

But when we leave, you go with, come with us. Otherwise, I said, then the Russians will kill us, now, because the people from the buildings knew that we are Jews. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: But thanks, God. It did not turn out that way. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What was it like in Berlin in 1981 for you? You were now in Berlin. 

SUBJECT: I'm now in Berlin. 

INTERVIEWER 1: First time? 

SUBJECT: It was amazing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: First time? 

SUBJECT: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: First time back? 

SUBJECT: First time back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where did you go? What did you see? What did you think? 

SUBJECT: Fantastic. We left Berlin, hm, 1947, eh, in November to go to America. And the city was, I would say, 3/4 of the city was in ruins. 

I remember the first time I went to Spittelmarkt. Everything was erased. I stood there, and I was looking. I did not know where I am. But I saw still the sign from the subway-- Spittelmarkt. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

SUBJECT: Everything, yeah. The Americans did a beautiful job. Too bad they came so late. 

[LAUGHTER] 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did you feel now going back? Did this-- 

SUBJECT: Oh, now? Yeah, my son came with me. Actually, he did-- he was born after the war. And we could go-- they invite the former residents. And till now, they invited about 12,000 people. 

It cost them billions. You stayed in a first class hotel-- beautiful. I did not recognize the city, a beautiful, modern city. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What memories came back? 

SUBJECT: Oh, this is Berlin? What we-- the time when we left it? No. It was beautiful. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did it feel like the same place to you? Or did it feel like a whole other-- 

SUBJECT: A new city, a new city. And they, eh, treated us wonderful. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But it's the same people. 

SUBJECT: No, no, no. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I know. It's the same people. 

SUBJECT: I think this-- I think these are mostly Jews are working for the Senate, yeah. They, they waited for us when we came from to Berlin, and they took us with buses. There were 400 people on this trip. 

They came from, eh, hm, New York. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did other memories come in? It's still the Germans-- are the sons of the old Germans are the same Germans still. 

SUBJECT: Yes, but we did not get in contact with them. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I was going to ask, did you-- you didn't have much contact with-- 

SUBJECT: No, no. No, we stayed-- the time was too short. Only seven days, we stayed. We did sightseeing. And we were invited four times for lunch and for dinner. Oh, everything, the Senate arranged it. It was beautiful. 

INTERVIEWER 2: But when you were in the streets, you must have seen Germans walking around, yes? 

SUBJECT: Yes, it's a very lively city. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you think, when you looked at them, did you have any feelings that you were looking at-- 

SUBJECT: At the Nazis, no I don't. 

INTERVIEWER 2: It didn't feel-- 

SUBJECT: I don't-- no. It's hard to say, because I did not have any contact with these people. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I guess the book is closed? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT: It was beautiful. Even my son enjoyed. He did not want to go. He said, I am--
