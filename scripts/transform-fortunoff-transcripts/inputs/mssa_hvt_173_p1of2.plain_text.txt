INTERVIEWER 1: Ready? Good. OK. OK. Hi, introduce yourself. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes, my name is Carl Shapiro. I was born in 1934 in Breslau, Germany. I was the only child. After the war, in 1947, my mother gave birth to a baby sister. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And your parents were doing what? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Excuse me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were your parents doing for a living? 

CARL SHAPIRO: My mother was a hausfrau, My father was-- before the war, he was a diamond dealer. I mean, around the First World War, that the time. But later on he was a leather goods manufacturing worker [? [SPEAKING GERMAN] ?] that type. 

I was the only son, the only child, and I was quite quite pampered. I do not recall very much from the period of 1934 on, except my memory-- let's say [? none ?] during the war. In other words, I do not remember anything about 1934-35. But in 1939-- my family-- my parents and I-- were sent out of Breslau. We were in Krakow. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What are the earliest memories of anything that you have? Vague. 

CARL SHAPIRO: No, virtually nothing. I cannot remember a thing in those years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What comes to your mind now? 

CARL SHAPIRO: What I do remember-- now that you mention, what I do remember is that I just never had any toys. I don't remember having children or toys. And later on, under Nazi occupation, my contacts were essentially only with adults and only dealing with matters of survival. And so I carried it into the present day even. So anyway, 19-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Scared? Fear? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. I would say it was more like playing hide-and-seek. No, I did not-- I did not see any atrocities. I don't recall seeing any atrocities. I was not hungry. I was the only child. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Playing hide-and-seek, what do you think of? How do you imagine it? 

CARL SHAPIRO: From time to time, my mother and my father told me we have to hide. We're going to run away. And to me, it was a game. It was only done with my parents. I never did it with other children. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Or who'll catch you? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. No. My parents were not really very talkative. So I don't remember them playing games with me. I do remember that they used to dress me up, before 1939, very prettily because I still have the photograph some place of myself with a special beret and a three-wheeled bicycle. But that's all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What comes to [INAUDIBLE] housefrau? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Excuse me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What comes to your mind about hausfrau? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Hausfrau means-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: I know. What comes to your mind? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Anything. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Well, if you-- nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: If you what? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Well, just immediately, the moment I heard-- I do not like to speak German or have any associations with Germany. So in fact, I was only once on German soil-- and this was after the war, and this was accidental-- when my plane, on the way to Israel, stopped over in Germany. So I just mentioned the world "hausfrau." I'm surprised I mentioned a German word. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What does a hausfrau look like? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Excuse me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What the hausfrau look like in imagination? 

CARL SHAPIRO: That's not something-- I don't-- my imagination's not good at it. I don't do any-- I don't remember any dreams even. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any a diamond dealer? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Only that my father told me that between the two wars he worked in [? Antwerp ?] selling diamonds and cutting diamonds. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What about German soil? Anything that comes to your mind? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Let's say that in a sick sort of way, I do admire the Germans for the fact that they're so efficient, and they build themself up so well. And there's unity among them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: People marching? 

Together? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. Can you describe it? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. If I saw something? 

INTERVIEWER 1: No, no. Just follow your train of imagination. You know, I'm throwing in words. 

CARL SHAPIRO: The Germans appeared to be real organized-- to me-- disciplined, having a goal, thinking about their fatherland, being stronger-- physically and economically. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You see people marching on the street together or doing something together as a group? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. They were-- as opposed to the Jews that we seem to be always at odds with each other-- they always follow a leader. They like to follow a leader. There was-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What imagery do you have now? Just talk about it. 

CARL SHAPIRO: The imagery that I have is what I recall from seeing the various films on television, whether it is Reconstruction, Second World War, or the rise of Hitler-Germany or from the Eichmann trials. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What imagery? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Imagery of the whole-- the entire mass, the entire Germany, rise up as one person, screaming, "Heil Hitler!" in the state of ecstasy as if they were under marijuana. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And a Jewish child with no toys? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I did not, at that time, feel I am missing anything. It's only in retrospect now that I'm married I have three children and have trouble relating to them, playing games, or knowing any games, or having the patience to play with them. This is when I realized that I did not have toys. I didn't have friends. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A [? Jew, ?] this child without friends, what imagery comes? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Well, on that score, you're touching a very sore point because I believe that I am part of the Jewish nation and very strongly. If any Jews attacked or hurt any place in the world, I feel as if I'm personally attacked by it, as if the attack is done on me. 

I remember-- this recently, in 1956, I was a junior in college in New York City and the Sinai War took place at the time. From the moment the war broke out, for the next three or four days, I had continuous diarrhea, I did not sleep those days, and it took me several weeks to recoup what I lost in school. 

So I find myself-- I look at myself as being part of the organism called [? Jewelry. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you beaten up by other boys? 

CARL SHAPIRO: If I find that you'd beat up-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. Just imagery. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Again, from the war? 

INTERVIEWER 1: The little boy being beaten up, attacked by a group of boys. 

CARL SHAPIRO: I don't-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What comes to your mind? 

CARL SHAPIRO: That we're being pro-- that this has been happening to us for generations, continuously. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But what imagery comes to your mind about the Jewish boy being attacked by a group of boys? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I have nothing. 

My only thoughts on it is I mentioned to my 11-year-old son, Shalom, that he should always fight for his rights, and I would never blame him or hurt him if he comes home with a bloody nose. I don't believe in fighting, but I do not believe in retreating. I personally never had the fights. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Neighbor children in Germany? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. Nothing at all. The only time I-- the earliest I remember interacting with children or playing with children was 1946 in a displaced persons camps in-- displaced persons camp in Germany. Not 1941-42, not in hiding, not even right after the war when I was liberated by the Russians. It's only, say, two years after the war. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Until 1946, until you were 12-year-old, you do not remember playing with a child or playing with a toy. Is that correct? 

CARL SHAPIRO: That is absolutely correct, yes. The old time I-- that's right. The only time I remember being in a game activity was in 1946 in [INAUDIBLE], in the American zone in Germany, a small town. I went out with children gathering strawberries or playing chess and soccer. But that's the first time I remember playing with children. 

I don't-- I should correct myself I did not have any children friends until I don't remember. I just don't have any friends. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In '39, your family moved to Poland. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Right. We lived in Krakow for about a year, year and a half. And then we were sent out in the eastern direction of Poland to east Poland. And after Russia and Germany went to war, we found ourselves in a small town in east Poland in a Carpathian Mountain area. We were refugees there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That's '41, and you were seven years old. Can you describe the town? 

CARL SHAPIRO: OK. Yes. Some of it is from my personal recollections, and some from what I remember in 1945 when I went back to the town after I was liberated by the Russians. It was a town of about 10,000 population. The tallest buildings were three or four stories high. 

Some streets were completely paved. Some were not. The town had a big salt mine. The reason I remember that is because the Pole that helped to save us was a mining engineer, and he worked in the salt mine. 

When the Germ-- when the war got really underway, the Germans told all the Jews in the small Hamlet town surrounding that town that they have to move into the city. So the population swelled from approximately to 10,000 people to say 15,000 or 17,000, of which 6-7,000 were Jews. In the beginning, we could live any place in town. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you, as a child, remember of the beginning of the war? 

CARL SHAPIRO: OK. What I remember is that one time my mother told me that the Germans, they wanted-- we should give them any jury we have, any furs, and pillow cases. And I found it very funny. Why do they need pillow cases and these sheets filled with-- what do you call it? Fine-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: [INAUDIBLE] 

CARL SHAPIRO: [INAUDIBLE], yes. The reason I remember is because I couldn't-- I could see why they want the jewelry at first, but not the-- so my parents explained. They probably needed to keep themselves warm during the war. 

In the same town, my grandparents lived, my mother's father and mother. Since we came from Germany, my father spoke a fluent German. And actually, it did not take many Germans to control the entire population. From what my parents told me, there were no more than three or four Germans in town, and they very seldom had anything to do with the Jews because they had plenty of helpers, who very willingly and with much enthusiasm, helped the several Germans to keep the Jews under control. 

There was one SS man who was in charge of collecting food to be sent to the German armies in Russia. And my father worked for him and, being the bookkeeper, as the farmers brought the foodstuffs, my father recorded it. So that SS man was very satisfied with what my father did. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember him? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I do not remember him, but my father was in contact with him after the war and was in contact with him after the war. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Were there no children in the ghetto? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Excuse me. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Were there children in the ghetto? 

CARL SHAPIRO: There were. Yes. The whole Jewish population was in the ghetto. Again, in beginning, we could live any place we wanted, and then the Germans told us we have to live in a smaller, smaller section. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember German uniforms from that time? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Please proceed. 

CARL SHAPIRO: No, I do not remember any uni-- I don't remember any uniforms at all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were eventually concentrated in one area. 

CARL SHAPIRO: We were eventually concentrated in one area. I noticed that there were fewer and fewer of us because somehow we needed less and less space to occupy in the town. We had-- my family had food because my father was the bookkeeper. So not only he managed to save some food or steal it-- anyway you want to call it, what was left over on the floor-- but he managed to save some and give to others, too. 

The imagery that I remember seeing is-- I was wondering how come some people were very fat and some were very thin. To me, a fat person meant he was a healthy person till my mother explained that they were-- the fat that I saw was pure water. They were actually starving. They were filled with water and due to eating grass and anything they could find. There were other people I saw were skinny. 

At that time, one of the local Ukrainian policeman, by name of, I believe, [INAUDIBLE], kicked my grandfather in the bone here. As a result, it didn't heal, and he became lame on the foot. By the way, that Pole-- or Ukrainian is in the United States. My father ran into him accidentally in New York sometimes 1948-49, but the man quickly disappeared. 

Anyway, within succeeding months, all of a sudden my grandmother vanished, and I never saw her. Essentially, within a matter of a few months, I didn't see my grandfather anymore or my mother. At this point, the SS man, to whom my father was the Jewish dog, to him, every-- every German, for that matter, every Gentile may have his favorite Jew. 

So my father was his favorite Jew. So he told him, I think, watch out for yourself. Since he never warned my father before, my father took that seriously. As a result, that night we ran away. 

And my next recollection was that-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the running away? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I do not remember a thing about it. No, I shouldn't say that. I remember only one-- I did not run away directly with my parents. A Pole came to pick me up, and at that time, I had the dark blond hair, I did not have a Jewish nose, and I spoke a decent Polish. So I went by train. He took me by train while my parents traveled by by night, and somehow we got reunited. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You remember the train ride? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I just remember I went with him to the train station. I rode on the train with him. An no one looked at me. No one pointed a finger at me. It was an uneventful train ride. It was eventful because I don't remember being on a train for quite a few years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you understand what was happening? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Excuse me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you understand what was happening or imagine-- 

CARL SHAPIRO: Well, yes. I understood that the Germans were killing Jews. That I understood. But that's where it stopped. I didn't have any personal experience. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But do you have any explanation for yourself about that? Fantasies about that? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What was the impact of you going with a strange man you didn't know and leaving your parents? 

CARL SHAPIRO: My parents told me to go with them. That was the end of it. After several years-- let's say from 1939 on-- because my parents told me to do it, I did. [INAUDIBLE] was an inactive or phlegmatic child, but in spite of me, [INAUDIBLE] better do what they tell me because it's for my own good. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Very obedient? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Excuse me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Very obedient? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I can't hear you. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Very obedient 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. But the obedience is because from the viewpoint my parents knew what was best for me, and they told me to do something. I did it. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you have any kind of premonition or vague understanding that big things were at stake, that it was no matter of childish whim to be able to say, no, I'm not going. I want to go with you. 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. No. Now that you mention it, I don't remember showing any act of rebellion or fighting back or talking back to my parents. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You know the ghetto was slowly disappearing, but there were children in the ghetto. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. There had to be. That's right. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But no? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I don't-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: You remember only adults? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I don't remember a single child that played with. To my knowledge, I don't think the Germans made special attempts at that time to get rid of the children first. But that's funny. Now that you mention it, I don't remember seeing any children playing with them. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I mean, there were children in the ghetto, but you don't remember any? 

CARL SHAPIRO: There should have been children in the ghetto. That's right. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And you don't remember seeing any? 

CARL SHAPIRO: That's right. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But it's not clear. Maybe the children were exterminated first. 

CARL SHAPIRO: That's right. 

INTERVIEWER 1: We are now in 194-- 

CARL SHAPIRO: '42. '42 and a half. 

INTERVIEWER 2: [INAUDIBLE] 

CARL SHAPIRO: As I mentioned, we have very little recollection of that period. And then there-- when my parents were working in the arbeitslager. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The train arrived. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. How I got reunited with my parents again, I don't remember. The next vivid scene in my mind is I see long barracks with beds, army cots, next to each other. Perhaps the interior of the barrack is 200 feet long, and I'd say 40 or 30 feet wide. So you can sleep on both sides. 

There was some pieces of furniture there, too, because local Jews could bring-- there was furniture because I was hidden between two pieces of furniture. So when everyone went to work, including my parents, they took two pieces of furniture, like a big credenza or two big credenzas, they put in the corner of the room, and I was in that corner. They left some food with me and a pot for in case I had to go. And that's where I was, from about 7-8 o'clock in the morning till whatever time they came home. 

Occasionally, someone entered such a barrack with a dog, the dog bark, and they just kept quiet. And that's how I lived in arbeitslager with my parents for about 3/4 of a year or so. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were the only child? 

CARL SHAPIRO: That's right. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And there were no children allowed in that slager? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I don't know. I was the only person hiding in the big barrack. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember them-- they're leaving in the morning? Getting up in the morning? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No, no special-- I don't remember any special instance, except they don't need to go there and be quiet until they came back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You heard the steps of people walking out or what? 

CARL SHAPIRO: Again, I don't remember. 

The camp itself-- I don't even remember the outside of the camp, except the camp served-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Could you ever leave the barrack? 

CARL SHAPIRO: I never left the barracks, but the point is we did escape from the barracks. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you never left because you were not-- you were illegal there? 

CARL SHAPIRO: That's right. You're right. I was illegal there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You could not leave the barrack. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. I was illegal there. Right. So the conclusion is there were no children allowed. That arbeitslager served big meals, [? pulp ?] meals, et cetera, in the vicinity. And when my parents saw, through the situation-- you know, every Jew thought that the Germans need them for the war effort. And that's how we kept our hope alive. That's how my parents kept-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Come back to the back. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the food? Eating? Going to sleep in the evening? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. No, I don't. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Talk-- asking your parents about it? 

CARL SHAPIRO: No. The rule was don't talk. Now that you mention it, virtually I did no talking for about three years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Because my parents saw that-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: I want, for a minute, more about the arbeitslager. 

CARL SHAPIRO: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: There might have been days where they didn't work, where the inmates stayed back. 

CARL SHAPIRO: I don't remember anyone staying back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. 

CARL SHAPIRO: I just see an empty barrack without people sleeping or talking or eating in it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. Wait. Just changing tapes. Do we have [INAUDIBLE]-- 

CARL SHAPIRO: That surprises--
