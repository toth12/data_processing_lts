Graves-- and they put the Jews over there in the graves. We stay over there. And those-- those times-- is a lot of freezing weather in this time of the year over there. We stay over there five days. In these graves. And after-- finally, they let us go. We walk back to Lodz. 

INTERVIEWER: Were you in the ghetto in Lodz? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, I've been all over. So when I come back to Lodz, then we start making a ghetto. They're making a ghetto. And then, in-- I just tell her the ghetto was operating 72 bakeries. I used to work in one of them. So the show goes on. So it wasn't right, because it was a ghetto. Anyway, it was close. But all right-- but then decide-- the German bakers from the city, they tell the government-- the German does-- they want to put the bread in the ghetto and they should close all Jewish bakeries. 

72 bakeries in the ghetto's a lot. So they closed up all bakeries. And two was left. And I was working in one of those bakeries. But the two bakeries belonged to the Jewish government from the ghetto. But the name-- his name-- I don't know [INAUDIBLE] already, but his name was Rumkowski. He was the president from the ghetto. 

INTERVIEWER: What was his first name? 

SUBJECT: I-- I don't know. I don't remember-- I don't remember his first name. But his name was Rumkowski. He was the president. So-- and this was [POLISH] in the ghetto. You know the [POLISH]-- means the Holocaust. The-- the caravan was going day and night already. People are dying from hunger, from-- you know. After all you're closing up-- you wait till they going to give you bread. And you have to die before. 

So I-- and I used to work in those bakeries still. But I see, then, Rumkowski, he order, who wants to go volunteer to German for work? He should sign up. And I went. I stay a whole night. I sign up. And I went-- volunteered to Germany in 1940-- in D-- December, 1940. 

INTERVIEWER: And did you go to Germany? 

SUBJECT: Right. 

INTERVIEWER: Where did you go? 

SUBJECT: I went-- we went in a town by the name of Spiegelberge. But This was-- 

INTERVIEWER: Sp-- Spiegelberge? 

SUBJECT: Spiegelberge, right. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you work there? 

SUBJECT: Oh, yeah. This wasn't a concentration camp yet. This was a working camp. We still wear our own clothes. So-- and every 5 kilometers was 350 guys from Lodz, building a parkway over there. So-- and we come over there in December, 1940. We didn't do nothing till May. 

INTERVIEWER: Were you frightened? 

SUBJECT: Huh? 

INTERVIEWER: Were you afraid? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER: Why? 

SUBJECT: From what I have to be afraid? We weren't-- 

INTERVIEWER: Germans with guns. 

SUBJECT: No, we weren't afraid. We weren't-- this time-- first of all, this time, wasn't a concentration camp yet. And if they want to have work, so we work. And if they want to kill somebody, they kill. It wasn-- in this camp was-- it was a camp. It wasn't bad. It was now a working camp. But still, the German is German. They still got-- what they kill-- somebo-- some people. I know a kid who used to hang himself in the-- in the barrack. 

And-- it was-- was a-- a lot of variety in this camp. Especial me. I-- uh-- I was very strong those years-- very, very, strong. I could-- what-- 20 kids couldn't do what I'd do-- I did. I was physically strong. And whatever they schlep over there, pick up something, I-- I helped them. So-- and we stayed over there till 1943. 

INTERVIEWER: You worked there till 1943. 

SUBJECT: Right. 

INTERVIEWER: What happened in 19-- 

SUBJECT: 1943-- you know, they don't finish it. They-- whatever they start, they don't finish. So just, it was a parkway. And 1943, they said, we going to go back to this-- to Lodz. So they put a sign on the train, [GERMAN]. That's what they call for the German. So a big sign on the train. 

And OK-- and then-- we all sat. We go back. We come to Poznan. Poznan? Did you hear about Poznan? 

INTERVIEWER: Mm. 

SUBJECT: No. Over there is-- they come to Poznan. They stop the train. And they took us off. Over there, we saw-- we saw that it was going on. We saw it in the street-- girls without hair st-- in the stripes. So the took us off from the train. We put in a [INAUDIBLE] then a house. And we build a new concentration camp by the name of Kreising. I'll bet you nobody was dead yet. 

I used to work in the cemetery. I put 32 guys in one grave. Nobody knew about this camp though over there yet. I'll bet you no. So we built-- over there, it was a camp. I didn't know what's happening. The people-- kids go out. They die. And what-- if you have a pot, you eat. If you don't have, you don't eat. In this camp, they make three nationalities. They split this camp. 

INTERVIEWER: If you didn't have our pot, your bowl-- 

SUBJECT: You don't eat. This was the beginning. 

INTERVIEWER: Did people take other people's bowls? Steal them from one another? 

SUBJECT: No. It was a-- I don't know. This camp was such a camp, I can't understand myself. I carry kids in home when we finished. And they die on my shoulder. 

INTERVIEWER: You carried children on your shoulders? 

SUBJECT: That's right. In this camp, we stay in the-- ga-- ga-- gallow a whole year. We used to work outside on the field-- was potatoes over there. If you grab a potato, they hang you. So the-- the gallow was standing a whole year round. One time, they hang up 17 guys-- I mean, seven guys. Four-- they hang up. Those three have to stand by the gallow. And they said, the Germans, [GERMAN]. You-- you'll be next. And they have to watch like they hang those four guys. 

This is small stuff-- stories. But that's-- this camp was un-- unbelievable. And we stay over that till 1943. And then, after '43, they went to-- to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, I was in just quarantine, just for-- you know-- passing by. I just ate two weeks. And they send me to Jaworzno, in a coal mine, to-- back to Poland. Or this is Poland. But in a coal mine. 

Over there, used to work outside. And you-- I used to work in the coal mine too. First, I work outside. And then I work 18 months in coal mine. So-- 

INTERVIEWER: Wel-- 

SUBJECT: So-- so many stories to tell. It's unbelievable. Once seen what I saw, it's a miracle that-- that-- I can believe it myself. In this camp, the German tell you that they not going to leave one Jew out alive from this camp-- indeed. Knock you in your head-- you live with them-- with this already. That's what they gonna-- if there's something gonna be finished-- this camp-- they had kill everybody. 

INTERVIEWER: How did they tell you? In what way did they tell you? 

SUBJECT: They-- in-- in German. 

INTERVIEWER: No. I know. 

SUBJECT: They-- 

INTERVIEWER: On a loud-speaker? 

SUBJECT: Loud? No, they tell-- no, the German goes in the barracks and they tell you. 

INTERVIEWER: What did they say? 

SUBJECT: That's-- they said the [INAUDIBLE] not going to let one Jew out alive from here, no matter what happened. And the kapos-- the-- the kapos were-- they-- they were the same-- sit in the same camps. You know, every-- every block have a kapo, of like a foreman. They was son-of-a-guns too, you know. They-- one kapo was-- they say, if you don-- if you come and the shoes in the barrack, they're hang you up by the hand. 

You have to leave-- about 20 [INAUDIBLE] and leave the shoes out and go barefoot in the camp. And if you make an [INAUDIBLE], he hang you by the hand. It was a lot of things like this. 

INTERVIEWER: The kapos, were they Jewish? 

SUBJECT: Kapos, they-- what? No-- 

INTERVIEWER: Were the kap-- 

SUBJECT: No, they're Polacks-- Polacks-- Polacks. 

INTERVIEWER: The kapos were never Jewish? 

SUBJECT: Yeah, sure. Oh yeah, they were Jews too. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: What happened to the kapos? 

SUBJECT: And then what happened-- this was-- this was 19-- we stay in this camp till 1945. 

INTERVIEWER: '45? 

SUBJECT: Uh-- till '44. So '44-- no, January '45, I think, or December '44. I'm not-- I ca-- but anyway, this was be-- a night before we leave this camp. It was-- the camp was 2,500 people in this camp. This was one-- the last night before we leave, we're supposed to-- because this was 1945, the Russian start to go for-- you know. They stay by Warsaw. 

And so they took us away from Germany-- from Poland. They drag us to Germany. So-- and in the last night before we leave the camp, all kapos went in for a coffee-- coffee in the kitchen. They all-- they all went in and a bomb went into the kitchen. They all die over there. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you feel? 

SUBJECT: What-- well, can you imagine? It's a miracle. Nobody-- nobody can tell-- can either-- can describe something like this. And we-- they drag us to Germany. It was come to Germany. We came over. Some-- a few hundred people, the rest they shot on the road. They couldn't take it. It was snow. 

INTERVIEWER: You were walking? 

SUBJECT: Right. We are walking. We come to a tow-- to a camp. It was the name of Blechhammer in Germany. And we stay over there-- we didn't stay too long. I said, two or three days. And then, they drag us to Gross-Rosen. Roads This was a death camp. I was already-- in those camps, I would rather dead myself.
