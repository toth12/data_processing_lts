INTERVIEWER 2: Roughly, when were you born? 

ZVI KANAR: I'm born is July 29-- July 17, in '29, exact. And, uh, before-- I was born in a family very orthodox, even Hasidic. My father was very, very Jew person, all my family. And, uh, like a small boy, I go to this-- to the cheder. And when I was 4 years-- maybe, yes, 4 years-- start to go to the cheder. 

And after, when I was 7, I start to go to the public school. Uh, don't forget, the public school in this time was very Christian, very Catholic. I mean all Poland mostly was very Catholic. So in my class I was maybe-- I remember three-- three Jewish kids-- around, uh, 35 or 40 kids, no Jewish. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Just to back up a minute, who was in your family? Who was there in your family when you were born?

And, uh, and if I remember my, uh, this time, I have a good time. I don't th-- that-- sure, there was anti-Semitic round, like everybody knows what was Poland, and even my town. But, um, was no for me personally. Of course, maybe because I was so young, and maybe I didn't understand everythings. And I remember that it was good, and for me was-- today, if I look back-- it's like in the-- the paradise. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You lived in a house or an apartment? 

ZVI KANAR: No. We live in a-- in a house. And, uh, I didn't remember nothing till the war some special bad about me. I mean, even sometimes people tells me-- I mean, in the school, outside, some tells me mangy Jew or some things like that. But that was some part from our life. Uh, that was-- uh, that was no so terrible for me.

INTERVIEWER 2: [SOFT LAUGHTER] 

ZVI KANAR: I don't know how that comes. I sing very well. 

And, uh-- and the one from this-- my good memories was that the first time I play-- like a small guy-- I play for a public. And first it was in the marketplace. I tell stories. 

INTERVIEWER 2: In the marketplace? 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. It was a small place. There was in-- I remember in the Sunday, people goes out, because Sunday people didn't work. Oh, there's work. I mean, but the marketplace was a place where everybody cames there. Everybody pass, was very small. 

So I remember-- I don't know how that begin-- I start to play and tell stories. And the people like that and applause me. And it was the first time in my life people applause me. 

SUBJECT: [SOFT LAUGHTER] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You stood on a box or something? 

ZVI KANAR: Eh, no, there was not even box. I was around with people, and, uh, mostly Jewish. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh-huh. 

ZVI KANAR: And I start to imitate everybody. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Huh.

INTERVIEWER 2: [SOFT LAUGHTER] 

ZVI KANAR: Of how you-- uh-- I mean, I-- I-- I was an imitator, and everybody likes me in town. And there was an image in this time. I-- like in badkhn you know, like that I tell stories. Even the stories was not true. I remember that I was a lot of, uh, fantasies. 

And I tell a story-- I see something like what just happened after I come home, example, and I tell to my father, to my mother, and to everybody, listen, listen, listen. It's really passed it in street, what you tell me? And I tell, yes, that was like that. I see this, this person who do that and that. But after I have bad conscience. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm. 

INTERVIEWER 2: [SOFT LAUGHTER] 

ZVI KANAR: Why I lie? And I tell, it's not true. Nothing is true what I tell. It's only a lie. 

[LAUGHTER] 

So it's-- my mother tells me, you lie all the time. No. Somethings is true and somethings lie. I mean, the-- I tell a story. 

INTERVIEWER 2: It's imagination. 

ZVI KANAR: Imagination. Exact. I have a lot imagination. And after I told-- even in the cheder I was like that. I didn't le-- like too much to learn. I was-- I liked to sing, and I liked to play. So even the cheder I-- I-- make stories that the rebbe start to stop, and I tell a story. In the meantime, we didn't learn. 

INTERVIEWER 2: [SOFT LAUGHTER] 

ZVI KANAR: And everybody liked that because I entertain. And I have a good voice in this time. And the people-- and I was the one small guy who sing and the-- play acts in the show with the big boys-- I mean 17, 16s, and I was small. He me on the bank and I sing with-- with this-- with this people, I mean, in the choral.

ZVI KANAR: And I was the one. And I have a very good, uh, voice this time to singing, and everybody-- I mean, that what I remember from this time. Not only that, but that is once today. 

Uh, I didn't have bad time this time. I cannot tell somethings that I was hungry. No. Of like-- my parents lived very good one with the other. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh-huh. 

ZVI KANAR: If how I know that-- I mean, I never hear something by my father tell something bad to my mother. And if it once my mother tell some bad-- once, I remember to today, express a shock. 

INTERVIEWER 2: [LAUGHS] She said something bad about your father? 

ZVI KANAR: Yes, to my father. 

INTERVIEWER 2: To my father. 

ZVI KANAR: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: To your father. 

ZVI KANAR: After, she cried-- somethings like that. That was a shock. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh-huh. 

ZVI KANAR: Not only for me. Even for my sisters, who was more older for me. But everything was-- was good. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You must've been your mother's favorite. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes, because I was ben zekunim. [LAUGHTER] Of course, and my father tells me to the rabbi-- I remember the first time he takes me to the rabbi. Because he was Hasid, he takes me to another town. 

And, uh, this memory is still today. If I think, that makes me a big-- I can know, uh, it was a good time. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So what, he took you to another town to see the Hasidic rabbi? 

ZVI KANAR: Yes, because the rabbi comes from a big town-- bigger town. I mean, for the East Europe he comes to-- to another town. And, uh, my father ta-- takes me the first time. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Which rabbi was that? 

It will-- uh, you will be surprised. He calls the Chelmer rebbe. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Huh. 

ZVI KANAR: From Chelm Yes. Verbleibenyu. And he wa-- he's coming to Pinczów. It's a small town, bigger from our town. And it was a couple hours to-- to go there. 

And I remember the way, how the Hasidim sing, and I sing, and there was, um, something-- today, I see that's so normal-- something that was-- I mean, that this time was the most normal time for me. 

INTERVIEWER 2: That's-- the world is-- was as it should be. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. And how I came to the rabbi. He was an old man. And who he wish me to, in Yiddish, to begin some lernen. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: And, um-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Which means to want to learn. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: To want to learn, exact. And I feel-- I didn't want too much to learn. It was something, uh, not especially. But, um, after when I go out, I kiss in the hand. He was very old rabbi. And how I go out-- and no-- I didn't turn to him with my back. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I see. 

ZVI KANAR: My father takes me like out. There was like somethings holy in the rabbi-- the hand from the rabbi when he-- he-- he put his hand to my face. And I was surprised, because I was very young. And the rabbi have white, light hands, you know? 

I mean, he never eat. He didn't eat too much. And, uh, the m-- I mean, he's learning all time. And-- and all this, I think that have an influence still today to me. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh-huh. 

ZVI KANAR: If I remember him, he did. And there was one, uh, from the-- when I, eh, think about it, there was a big, big impression. And maybe that was the biggest day when you ask. I don't know if the marketplace or this. You see? And, uh-- yeah, that is my time. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You had the feeling that you were special in some way? 

ZVI KANAR: What do you mean? 

INTERVIEWER 2: That you-- you were special and to-- in your family or a special position. 

ZVI KANAR: Me? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. Eh, maybe too much special-- because everybody likes me, even the town. Because I was the son for my father Poltier and for my mother Adella. So everybody knows me. Everybody likes me. Everybody, uh, even respect, even the no Jews. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. But mostly the Jews, you're saying, that was [INTERPOSING VOICES] 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. But even the no Jews knows who I am. I am the son from Poltier Kanar. And mine-- and my father have-- have a name in this town. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: And, uh, it's many reasons why he have the name. Uh, because he was-- and I-- I-- I don't like to tell it because he was my father. You can see it's my father is the best. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: But he was really some special person. Uh, he have a store. And you know, even-- it was many poor people there in this town. No Jewish people-- poor who came to the store to buy needles for one groschen. You can believe that? That's from one penny, giving needles for one penny. 

So my father give them couple needles for one penny. The other store didn't accept that-- must be the minimum five groschens to buy-- like, in New York you go for one penny, you cannot buy nothing. 

So, uh, my father gave to everybody because he knows there was carpenters, many people, poor people, and he give for everybody. He tells, you need to give them somethings. 

In the same, time my father was a very good business ma-- person. He do very good business. So he was like that. For this reason, I think today-- I think so. For this reason, people respect him. 

And I tell you something. It's a story, unusual story. What has happen in '40-- in the world, it was '41 or '40, or '40, 1940 by the Germans. Because we have-- my father's store have as a big name, the Germans put in kommissar. You know, only in big stores he put the kommissar, meaning in German volksdeutsche who will be the head of the store. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sure. 

ZVI KANAR: Not my father. So in '40, I think the end of '40, he put somebody-- the Germans put somebody-- I mean, and it's all small town. They do that in Kraków and Kielce and bigger towns. And he put us and kommissar. 

There was volkseutsche from Poznan. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: And he's coming by us. And my mother, my father, we like to live with him good. He wasn't volksdeutsche He don't understand too many about, uh, about business. 

My father understand. So he tells to my father, we'll make business. You to-- I will only because you a Jew and you have know it is a big business. You have not the right to be the o-- I mean. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sure. 

ZVI KANAR: Right, so. And I remember how we accept him home good. He was a volksdeutsche. He speak Polish. He was volksdeutsche. And all there was in Germany and from Germany-- but never mind. 

Um, after six weeks, he throw out my father from the store. He tell him to go out. So he will be-- I mean, official he don't need to do that in this time. I mean, my father need to work. And If he was good, my father cannot work-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sure. 

ZVI KANAR: --in the store. He throw out. Now, all the town, the no Jewish, the Christians, the people from the town. People was very naive in this time. We too. He wrote a letter to the governor, to the German-- who, uh-- to [? Mierrhoff ?] that was the-- I don't know. Yeah. The governor from the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: The district, you mean? From the whole district? 

ZVI KANAR: Yeah, district. Yes. A letter that this man is no good, that my father is good. My father have many-- you know, the Polish people do that. You can believe that? To the governor to write in the-- in the war second? 

INTERVIEWER 2: In the war time. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: OK. Don't forgot it was before the Holocaust, because in our place in Poland the Holocaust start in '42, the summer '42. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was this man who came into the store to take over the store, was he the first inkling that you had? Was that the first time that you had anything to do with any Germans or? 

ZVI KANAR: Oh no. We have the first, uh, the first shock that was in '39, 7-- September 7, '39, when the Germans comes in and they kill my uncle, example. That was the-- the-- but- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Maybe-- maybe you want to talk of how the-- the war started, and-- did you-- did you hear that the-- a war was declared? Or how did you hear? 

ZVI KANAR: Oh yeah. We know that before the war was declared, we know there was mobilization in Poland. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh-huh. 

ZVI KANAR: A couple weeks ago, even then I was in school and that was, uh, in June, 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: End of June. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: So we know that this can be war. In the school we learn that, uh, Germany is very bad, that we will be the victorious-- in couple-- in couple days, we will be in Berlin, in capture Berlin. 

I mean, my-- my teacher tells that's to us, you know? That the Germans didn't have all to eat. I mean, the propaganda, and the Polish propaganda was like that. We believe in that. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So you d-- you were not very concerned what will happen in the war? 

ZVI KANAR: Look, I was so young that in some way I like to be at war-- that will be a war maybe. I'll be a hero or somethings like that. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: You know? I mean, home I hear other stories of-- about the Jewish. But, eh, no Jewish was, you will be-- we will fight. We will will be heroes. And that I learn it in school that the [INTERPOSING VOICES] 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were you hearing at home? 

ZVI KANAR: Home was different, was another culture, you know? There was two-- you know, my father, war would be this bad. I mean, maybe people know-- Jewish people-- think too there will be it. 

But in school, for the kids, the teacher tells, war will be-- will be in Berlin a couple days. You see, the kids, uh, uh, no understand. We didn't understand. We just, maybe it will be like that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were your parents worried? Were they concerned? 

ZVI KANAR: My parents worry very much. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: For the Germans. We know what's the Germans. We know that was after the Kristallnacht. I hear about the Kristallnacht. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: We hear about that. We talk about that. We have newspapers. You know? We know what has happened, what the Germans is. This [? [YIDDISH]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: Of a new fuhrer, or I don't know. But in school was different-- in the Polish school-- and cheder was different. At cheder, we worry. 

Uh, but in the school, the Polish school, you know, the Polish-- Polish hero. This time there was, uh, so different. It's-- uh, the-- the Polish people, the-- the mobilization-- the first mobilization was before the war, a couple weeks. 

I remember people were singing-- the soldiers. We go to the war. It was singing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did this affect as a child? How do you think that-- what this meant to you, this difference between what they were saying to you in school and how the non-Jewish people were feeling? 

ZVI KANAR: Uh, in this time-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Right. 

ZVI KANAR: --in this time I don't understand so good. I was a little from two sides. Uh, one side is my Jewish home, uh, experience. Is very separate from the gentiles. The other side-- even we live together, we live in the same neighborhood, you know. But it was very, uh, separated. We have our, uh, yontis and our gut and our everything-- our eating. You know? 

On the other side, I live with other people too. I go to school. And this by us was too small to open a special Jewish school. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: So I go to the-- to the school who every morning when we come to the school, everybody clings to the school, he make and, and, uh, pre-- what call that, the? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Pray. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Prayer. 

ZVI KANAR: And prayer. So we Jewish kids, we didn't do that. We stand up, and we silence. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: But I come to the school, I need to take out my hat. Home, when I go out from school, I to direct in my hat back. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: You see? It's-- it's not like today, you can go here in New York, or in the states. Even Belgium today of in Europe, you go with-- with your kippah. That's no-- yarmulke-- that's no-- that was not possible. You must take out. You see? 

And, uh, and everything around-- we learn the history of Poland, heroes, you know. And the Po-- the Polish people believe in he-- heroism and heroes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: So I was in some way, I liked it. And I was a patriot. I tell you somethings. I was a Polish patriot too. Even my sisters, we believe, we like Poland. Even all this, what's happened, we like Poland. You couldn't believe it. 

I mean, maybe if I will be older, I will understand more. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: But at this time, I like. I was a Polish patriot. Even I was dreaming in the war, e-- even before the war, people tells, oh yes, when I will be-- I will grow up, I will go to Eretz Israel. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: You know. But then was somethings against one the other. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: You-- you could be a patriot and a Zionist at the same time. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. Yeah, sure. I mean, my father was no especial Zionist, because he was too, uh, Hasidic. Uh, but he was not so anti, you know. 

Give an example, Purim-- Purim time, when you sit by the table. Everybody comes to raise money, from all organizations-- from right, to the left, Zionists and Hasidic. My father give for everybody. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: And when once, I remember, like a small boy, two boys comes in from our town, very young, maybe 16, 17. And they bring a picture from Jabotinsky, and I see he didn't have a hat. And I tell, hey, he's a goy. He didn't have a hat. 

My father was surprise about the two guys. Goes out, he tells me, what do you do? What do you do? Why to-- ? I tell, look, he have no hat, I mean. He tells, no, that's for the picture he do that only. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: You see? And he tells, it's no nice what you do. You see the two guys how-- how you making bad, the two guys. [INTERPOSING VOICES] feel bad. 

INTERVIEWER 2: They-- they felt embarrassed, yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. But I was very young, and I don't understand the Jew didn't have an hat. You see how there was both side? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. And then the war started then. How did you hear that it started? I mean-- 

ZVI KANAR: Uh, the war started very quickly. I mean, we hear it, and a couple days later, the Germans was there-- seven days later, one week later, the Germans comes in. And, uh, that was the first shock when the Germans comes in. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So c-- can you tell us how that was? 

ZVI KANAR: Because first, uh, they killed my uncle in same day. Uh, they killed my uncle, Uncle Noah. And he was in-- because he tells that he shot on the Germans, that he have a rifle, and he shot on the Germans. So-- so the Germans shot him, yeah, from his house. 

And he was a very Hasidic person with the-- you know, with the beard. And he even was a teacher, a melamed. I know it was a melamed. You know, a melamed, in Poland, in my town, he was really somebody who don't know to do nothing. Because he start to be-- and, uh, to be success in, uh, in business. But he was not success. So the last, what do you do? You become to be a melamed. We call him a schvunts melamed. 

So and the German tells that he killed on the ge-- in the same day, in the morning, the Germans come in, they are from this house, and he fired a rifle, and that this Jew, he kills some Germans. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The German told this story to whom? 

ZVI KANAR: He don't tell the story. He take him out. He tell that this-- that he killed him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I see. 

ZVI KANAR: He don't need to tell the story. You know, there was people, there was the Wermacht and that. No that says why. Remember, the Wermacht, somebody saw he take him out, and he shot him for nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You didn't see it? 

ZVI KANAR: No, I didn't see it. But he shot him. And that was-- [SIGHS] I mean, the-- and-- and for me, that was-- I don't understand that they-- maybe I start to-- to dream. Maybe he was really hero. I'm sure. I mean, hero. Maybe he really shot-- I mean, that's not true. Nobody, 'cause he-- he don't know what's a rifle. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: I mean he is a person so naive, so-- they say he shot. I mean, that's-- that's nonsense. But in my mind, like a small boy, I thought, who knows? Maybe he was an hero, and he kill, and that is good. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What ti-- do you remember what time of the day the Germans marched in? Was it in the morning, in the evening? 

ZVI KANAR: Uh, he take him out in the morning-- in time when there was the shot and the Germans comes in, and the Polish soldiers goes out. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What, you heard shooting? 

ZVI KANAR: Oh yes, a big shooting in our town, you know. And after the Germans take us out, all the people-- Jewish and no Jewish in the marketplace. And it was very dangerous because for somethings they like to shot all the town-- the people. 

Because maybe wasn't soldier, maybe wasn't Polish soldier who shot from this house. Can be. I'm not sure. And he would take him. What's different, he will take? He took him. 

So, uh, and I remember, I-- I-- like a small boy, I start to cry Shma Israel. [LAUGHS] I mean, everybody uh, uh, do that. And me too, and [? [YIDDISH]. ?] And I ask my father, tell if he shot, and we will-- I will see you in the other world. I-- I was so-- but I believe so that after death we'd be alive-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: --that I asked my father, we will see you together? We will be together after? And my father tell me, sure we'll be together. I mean, my father worried too because-- and after, when we come-- the German didn't shot us-- my father tell the story to everybody, how I cry Shma Israel and, uh. Never mind, the other side was Christians who-- who-- who do the same. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: You know, so. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yes. So they were afraid too. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. Yes. That was the first shock when the Germans comes in. He shot mein uncle. And-- and after was a little quiet. Yes. 

He take-- took out everything from the store, from my father, because there was a store from barzel, eikh omrim? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh, i-- irongoods. 

ZVI KANAR: Irongoods. So maybe the Germans needed a lot-- a lot of irongoods. So he take out in the same morning. Was-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] 

INTERVIEWER 2: Irongoods, like hardware store, right? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: Yeah. He goes in and take out. 

INTERVIEWER 1: This is the same day, wh-when you were in-- 

ZVI KANAR: The same day, the next day, and three days later, because the-- the-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: It's a big hardware store. 

ZVI KANAR: Yeah. The Germans need it maybe. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: He goes in. I mean, other stores too. But not so much by us is. And I remember, even a German comes. He give to my father some things. We take out. We have in-- in a paper that we take out. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A receipt. 

ZVI KANAR: That we took out. That's all, I mean, one something. You see. 

And now, there was the other shocks. In the evenings, the Germans come, talk to our [KNOCKING] doors, and he looks for rifles. And they take out everything what he can find. 

And we worry for my two sisters. I have-- my older sisters was pretty girls. We worry very much. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How old were they at the time? 

ZVI KANAR: They was, um-- my sister was this time I'm sure 18 years old-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: What's her-- 

ZVI KANAR: --the older sister. 

INTERVIEWER 2: --what's her name? 

ZVI KANAR: Rachael. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. And the other sister? 

ZVI KANAR: And the other was younger with one year, Marla-- two blonde girls. And we worry very much, especially my mother. And my father too, I mean-- but my mother. 

Uh, because, um, in our town was happened some things with girls. I tell you true, I don't know till today what's happened, because once the Germans comes in and take my sister away. And my father was-- he cannot fight, but my father start to, no, don't do that. You cannot do that. And he was with a rifle in the hand. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: So, no, no, we need to-- that she-- that she and-- she knows good German. Because she speaks German, we speak all German. So she went to-- into [INAUDIBLE] with some places. 

And I don't know what's happened. He takes her for half an hour and after she comes back. I see-- I don't know what's-- what's happened. I don't like even to today to know what's happened. I think there's nothing happened. 

But my father, my mother cried, and my-- and my mother didn't like that she goes. And-- and there was two Germans only, two young guys. And there was very [INAUDIBLE]. Believe me. 

And, uh, we hear crying from the other houses, even no Jewish, Polish. And I think that something was raping that we hear that in the night. And that was the first night, and the second night, and the third night-- you know, the beginning, the occupation. 

And it was a very big shock for me, because this time, I was changing totally. I don't like no wars, and I know what the war is. 

Uh, but, uh, even that, today, looks me that was somes normally for war. You know what I mean? Because what the Holocaust comes, there was somethings so irrational. Even that we know that was war before, and there were some similar, uh, uh, stories. You know, my father tells some. 

You know, my father was-- I don't know if he was naive, but he believes, uh, a little that the German culture cannot be so raw, you know? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Cultured people. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. He tells, how's that possible? And then I remember when he talked to the-- to the two soldiers. That was the first night-- of the second night, I don't remember. [INTERPOSING VOICES] 

INTERVIEWER 2: The two soldiers that came to pick your sister, yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: Yeah. He-- he speaks very good German. And even this, he tells to the Germans, you know, I was-- uh, I know what is the war and I-- because he. I mean, there was something he speaks so, uh, nice to these people. 

That was one guy he tells, let's go, let's go-- I mean, a German. So he-- he tell, let's go. OK. OK. Let's go. And the other tells no. I mean, like that, and he tells, you know. The other, I-- if he got one guy start to be-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: He almost convinced him. 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. Sometimes like that feel. And so my father feel that. So he start to do that by the other Germans who comes in, to talk nice, and to speak good German, and you are a big, uh, nation, and you so cultured, I remember you for the first war, you know. And then all this-- all this is some way helps, some way didn't help. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How-- how old was your father then? 

ZVI KANAR: In the 40s. I think he was 45 years old. No, maybe younger-- he was 42 years old in this time-- in the 40-- 40. So he-- he knows the Germans a little, I mean, from before. He knows a little the culture. Even he was Hasidic, he knows that. So he talk with this people and-- but that was the shock. 

INTERVIEWER 2: He had the beard? 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. He have a beard-- no long beard, but he have a beard. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And a black hat? 

ZVI KANAR: Polish small hat. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: He was very Hasidic. And, uh, he was so Hasidic, he never give a hand to a woman. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: So what do you know. But if a woman give him a hand, he gave back. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: If it was not Jewish-- because he tells, if a woman give you a ha-- the hand, she don't know that, and you didn't give back, she-- if she didn't-- if she Jewish, she need to understand, will no give. But you know, she don't understand. She thinks that you do some bad to her. So he give back sometimes. 

OK, that's-- because I know it was, uh, people comes from out town-- edels, uh, the very rich people, who-- you know, Poland was the-- like the 19th century. There was still feudalism like that. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: Very rich people-- and there was womans-- I remember, there was the-- the-- the edels. You know edels? 

INTERVIEWER 2: Um. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Gentlemen, you mean? Like-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Uh, yeah, nobility. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: Nobility. So who didn't speak even Polish. She likes to speak between, um, French, of Italian. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: You know, it-- that was just, you know, like that. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: And he comes in, he take to my father and-- and Herr Kanar and-- before the war. And because my father speak German, so sp-- she speaks some words in German. It's nice. There was a li-- Really she comes to the-- to the town with-- with six horses, you know. And there was in place the couple sisters. 

So and she comes, uh, to, uh, have Herr Kanar and she give the hand. So my father give her hand back. [LAUGHS] I mean, she no understand it. You know? 

INTERVIEWER 2: So-- so go on. So there was this emotional shock? 

ZVI KANAR: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And then what happened after that? 

ZVI KANAR: And then come, you know, uh, to the-- to the school. You can believe that I start to go to the school in October, and the Germans comes in. In October, the town opened the school back, the Polish school. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: So I go back to the school. Sure, I go back to the cheder. Not like before, because you know, we worry the Germans come. But it was a small town. There was not many Germans there. 

So I go to the cheder normally. A couple days later, but no like before, you know, you worry. And to the school I go back, till December. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: '39, two months I go back to the school. And from that same time in after the two weeks we have the vacation, the winter vacation. On New Year, the Jewish must now go back to school with Christians. Means we can go if we have our school, a Jewish school. But we didn't have the Jewish school, so no more school. 

But my mother send me to the same teacher. She was an woman, and she teach me privately. So twice, three time in week I go to her. 

INTERVIEWER 1: To her house? 

ZVI KANAR: To her house. So. And she-- sure she was a big part. She-- she come form Warsaw. And she really learn, um, stories. And what she learn us very patriotic stories. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hm. 

ZVI KANAR: Told us how Poland was occupied so many time. And she cried when she-- she was really like that. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hm. 

ZVI KANAR: She was an-- an, um, a lady maybe 32 years old, uh, very pretty, and I like her very much. 

[LAUGHTER] 

I was in love with her. But I guess first I was in love with her, you know? And I like to go to her, because she tells me so many nice stories. And, uh, once that's true. Once, I-- she asked to-- that I make a story-- what I will do when I will be a big-- uh, well, be grow up. 

And I wrote this story-- when I will grow up, there wasn't a war. I will grow up. I will go to the kibbutz. And I give a story how the kibbutz will be nice, and I will work and the-- you know, many kibbutz. How we come back afternoon, how we eat lunch nice with whites service on the-- on the table, you know? And all this fantasy. 

She was not so happy. She tells me, you know, you're a Jew. He calls, no Jew. He calls even Mosaic... 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mosaic faith. 

ZVI KANAR: Faith like that. But you in Pol. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

[QUIET LAUGHTER] 

ZVI KANAR: So you see, she was not so happy-- she likes to read. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

ZVI KANAR: She was very honest. She likes me. She likes-- I mean, she was [INAUDIBLE]. People tell like she was [INAUDIBLE], maybe she come from Warsaw. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

ZVI KANAR: She comes from Warsaw. But after, she change her mind. And, uh, my mother helps her. My mother pay her good too. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And-- and she didn't have any trouble for teaching you. There was no-- 

ZVI KANAR: No, was illegal. 

INTERVIEWER 1: It was illegal. 

ZVI KANAR: Sure. Nobody need to know that. I mean, um, no. The Germans don't know. Should know the Germans-- it was illegal really. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So it was a secret you went there, but-- 

ZVI KANAR: Yeah. But the secret was not so big secret, because it was a small town. Who will know that? Who will go to the Germans to tell that? We-- we don't think about it. 

But in the same time, I still go to the cheder, and I learn. I mean, you see, the beginning, the first year, '40, in the beginning, or even '41, there was war. It's a little normal for me. Because by us was no ghettos. For us was not a ghetto. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hm. 

ZVI KANAR: Small town was not a ghetto, but the Jews, I think from '41, something like that, we didn't can go out from town. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: That start to be problem because many Jews in my town live with-- from the people outside town, around. So-- but people goes. It goes illegal. And you find people he ki-- uh, killed some people-- even from my town, I think so, or from around town. So find-- find a Jew outside, he kills him. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Sure. 

ZVI KANAR: But that, I think, that was beginning '42-- of the end '41. I can no-- not can-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: And you-- you didn't have any problems with food or something? 

ZVI KANAR: No me. No me. First, don't forget. It was a small town. The-- the peasants bring food in town. And, uh, I cannot tell if somebody died from hungry this time, no-- even people who goes illegal outside to the country. 

In the country, in our side, there was no poor country-- I mean, poor, but it's very good. The earth was very good, very rich. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

ZVI KANAR: You know? Uh, you see-- sure, there was very primitive of one side. But to people to die from hungry? No. Nobody died from hungry in our town. 

I mean, we have potatoes. Somebody didn't have meat, he ate potatoes. He had bread. He had ri-- rice, no, but, uh, some other things. I mean, no. Opposite. 

There was people come from the biggest towns, from Kraków from Sosnicowice, even from Katowice-- from the biggest town, the ghettos start to be. So you didn't like to live in the ghetto, comes to our town. So in the war, I think was past maybe 150 families, of even more. 

INTERVIEWER 2: And, uh, who put them up? 

ZVI KANAR: I mean, the Jews in our town, there was families who comes, brothers to sisters to-- to-- to parent. Even comes strange pe-- even from Warsaw, from the ghetto, I mean, I remember was a couple people come. The people helped the one the other. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did your family have some people living with them? 

Uh, n-- yes. By us too, beginning was living a family, uh, mein second grandmother, from Sosnicowice she comes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hm. 

ZVI KANAR: You see, she comes even before the Germans comes in. She round up from-- because Sosnicowice is on the west, so she round to the east more. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hm. 

ZVI KANAR: And she stop out. She-- she thinks it was better to be in the small town.
