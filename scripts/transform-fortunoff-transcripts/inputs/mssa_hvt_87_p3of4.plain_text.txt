And we were all desperate. We were all, um-- we know that nothing-- nothing-- nothing could-- could be-- when you-- when you don't jump, you will be in Auschwitz. When you jump, maybe one or two of us will live. 

All of a sudden, the train stopped. And we stand and stand without-- without-- and we stayed on this. It was suffocating.

Every-- every-- every few minutes, somebody else could take breaths at the-- at the small window that is in this-- in this train. And somebody-- somebody who was looking out tolds-- told that-- that we are not together with our trains, that-- with other trains, that we are on a-- on a second--

Now, we are back in-- in Romania. It is not-- it's not Auschwitz, yes. So we didn't jump. And the-- the whole [CHUCKLES] rest it whole without jumping.

And he-- of course, he helped us at the-- at first. And my mother a seamstress, you know. Everywhere, you-- [CHUCKLES] you can-- you can live with it. And I've helped her. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you ever feel along this journey, did you ever feel despair? 

SUBJECT: Yes, of course. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you-- 

SUBJECT: It was so. Or I was in despair, or my mother was in despair. Thank God not together. 

So we-- [CHUCKLES] we have-- we have always influenced one-- one another-- one the other. When I was quite out of, uh, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hope. 

SUBJECT: Hope. So my mother was what to say. You are young, in the ball pit. And there will pass on. And-- and-- and it will be good. 

And when she was in such a depression, I was-- [CHUCKLES] [COUGHS] I-- I was the support. 

INTERVIEWER 2: What has it left you with? What do you feel now? 

SUBJECT: What I feel now. [SIGHS] 

You see, all what it was-- it was so horrible that I am sure I can't, uh, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Pass it. 

SUBJECT: I can't pass it-- passed it-- to-- to-- to-- to somebody, for you have to be in and to feel it. You can't feel it when you-- when you only hear these things. Now when I'm-- when I'm hearing myself, it's-- it's as if I tell a story of somebody, where it is impossible to-- to make it through. It's for a-- for a human, eh, um, um, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mind. Your mind. 

SUBJECT: Mind. It is-- it's just impossible to-- to-- to live it. It's impossible. I don't know how we live it. I don't know how-- how-- how was it. 

I know the facts, yes. It was this and this and this. But how was it? It just-- it just-- just impossible to-- to-- to tell it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the feeling of shame that you were talking about? 

SUBJECT: Oh, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Does this still bother you? 

SUBJECT: Of course. And there is another feeling that I-- that I'm sure I will not forget. When we were-- it was just the same in Warsaw and in-- in-- in Bochnia, in-- in ghetto when we were closed. 

You know, I-- I was in a, um, um-- I was, um, closed. And behind the-- the wall, there were people who are walking, who are living a normal life, eh, um, just as-- as I-- you was once. And through the-- the wall, there are people on another planet, on another-- another the, you know, not-- not here. It's not in-- it's-- it's-- it's impossible. How was it? 

You-- you can't-- you can't, um, get through it. It's just impossible. You know that it was. And you can't-- that's enough. 

INTERVIEWER 2: I think this was the most traumatic for me. I know-- 

[SIDE CONVERSATION] 

INTERVIEWER 2: The-- what you said about remembering at the end of each day-- where were you and when did this-- 

SUBJECT: Oh, when I was in Warsaw, as Christian, every night, I-- I tried to remember what-- what I have done and what I've said from the morning, from the beginning. And what I-- what I said-- what words and-- and whom I met, and what he said, and maybe-- maybe something was wrong. And maybe-- maybe I have to-- to change my-- my-- my dwelling. Maybe it is impossible for me to live anymore in this place. 

It was terrible. And at nights, of course, [SIGHS] uh, to think all over-- it's-- it-- it-- it was terrible. It was-- it was just terrible to live there. 

And I was so glad when I want-- when I-- when I had the opportunity to-- to live-- to leave, eh, Warsaw and to-- to go to-- to-- to went away that I have done a great deal for it. It wasn't so simple. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you-- why did you review what happened during the day? What was the purpose? 

SUBJECT: For I was afraid that I had-- that I said something that somebody could, eh, understand that I'm a Jew, that somebody will, um, will do me something that why-- that I will go to the gestapo. Of course, I was afraid all the time. 

INTERVIEWER 2: So you would picture in your mind? 

SUBJECT: It was as-- as a picture-- as a picture-- as a-- as a movie picture. I have-- I've heard everything, every word. And, of course, I was afraid. 

Once, we-- you know when-- when-- when we will have, uh, szantaz at home, it was at the beginning when I-- I was together with my mother in the first-- in the first, uh, dwelling. Um, and at 9:00, there came the-- the police and told us that they know that we are Jewish and that we have to go with them to the gestapo. [SIGHS] I was ready to go with them. 

I-- I thought-- at that time, I thought that I will manage. How, I don't know, for nobody came back from gestapo, from-- from this street, from this building of-- of gestapo. Nobody went out of that. 

And, uh, my mother began to-- to weep. And-- and she gave them everything that we had at that time. And they said, all right. But tomorrow, you had not to be here anymore. 

Tomorrow, we were not there. We were out of place, me and her. And so we were without-- without dwelling. 

And then we were-- we were, uh, seeking? Searching. And, you know, in, um, in a newspaper, you could find places, uh, that you can, uh, um, not rent-- uh, um, to rent a dwelling. A dwelling, Quincy? 

INTERVIEWER 2: A flat. 

SUBJECT: A flat, yes. We went together. For the first time, went together. And this was a man who put this, um, 

INTERVIEWER 1: Ad. 

SUBJECT: This-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Advertisement. 

SUBJECT: Advertisement, especially for szantaz. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Szantaz means blackmail. 

SUBJECT: Yes. Yes, especially for blackmail. And we came the-- for you know it was a time that no, uh, Polish people were not changing their-- their flats. Everybody were sitting in the-- in-- in place, where he-- where he was. 

Only the Jewish people who were here have a blackmail and have-- there have a blackmail, and-- and, uh, from one town to another, to another were moving. They were moving. So everybody knew that who was moving is a Jew. 

And when we came there to get this flat, he told my mother, why did you? You are Jewish. Why you-- why did you, uh, left ghetto? You don't know that you will, meh, meh, lose your daughter in such a way? 

So I told him, we are not Jewish. We have Polish passports, and we are not Jewish. And you don't speak to us like that. 

And, as always, my mother broke. And she told him, and you think that in ghetto we'll live? You don't know what it is in ghetto? I don't know want to know. 

We gave him money, and we went away. We were just afraid to-- to move, for he told us that the building is surrounded by Germans and that everybody knows that who is coming to him is Jewish. That's one of the-- of the things, when-- when Jews were-- were searching a flat. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What's the most-- the worst thing that you can remember? 

SUBJECT: I think the deportation of the 7,000. To see the people going. They were going as if for a picnic. 

I don't know. They-- they didn't realize maybe where they are going. Um, they were sad that-- that they are going to work. And everybody knew that-- that it is not true. 

But, eh, you know, when they wanted just-- we all wanted to-- to-- to believe it. For it is impossible to-- to think about that you are going to death. Um, it's just inhuman. You-- you can't. You-- you-- you can't. 

And this feeling, when you are in-- in-- in-- in ghetto, um, so closed, and you think about this, that outside is another world, a quite normal world. Children are going to school. And, uh, and, um, there are, um, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Weddings. 

SUBJECT: Weddings. And-- and, um, a-- a normal living. And-- and here, where-- when-- when-- when you-- where you are, in this small-- in this small place, eh, it's-- it's-- it's another-- another-- another planet, another-- another-- you can't-- you-- you-- you don't know. You don't know what it-- what it is. And--
