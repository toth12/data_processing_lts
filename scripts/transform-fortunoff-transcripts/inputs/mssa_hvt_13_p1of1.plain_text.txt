You see, I'm very nervous, too. I went through and I-- I realize this is not any more depression. Forget it. Whatever I try to talk to him, he turns around his business. You know, he said what I went through? Do you know what I had the-- nobody wants to-- I can't hear any more. Nobody wants to know. 

INTERVIEWER: Why did he ask me whether I saw-- why did-- what did you mean, do I see your eyes? 

SUBJECT 2: It's-- you see? 

INTERVIEWER: What-- what-- what does that mean? 

SUBJECT 2: I wish I knew. 

SUBJECT 1: I-- I not understand, lady. What are you talking-- 

SUBJECT 2: Sie fragt [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] mit oygen. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. 

SUBJECT 1: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] 

SUBJECT 2: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] 

You know what he means now? You see, you have to be a-- a minister, you know what I mean? You have to be I don't know what. Because they recognized in his eyes that he's a Jew so that hate him even there. The whole world knows that they hate us when he was in Russia. 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

INTERVIEWER: When he was in Russia they thought he looked Jewish because of his eyes? 

SUBJECT 2: Yes. Yes, because of his eyes, because of his head. 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: He was-- you see, we was four and a half years; he was all these years. So the man is totally nuts, totally ruined his life complete-- complete. 

SUBJECT 1: It is in-- 

SUBJECT 2: You understand, I try to explain it to him and try to explain it to him. He keeps om saying the same thing, you didn't go near this. You know what he said to me? You know, you remember, he said, when I wouldn't save you in Bershad, in Balta. You was like a skeleton. You was-- you would-- I said, you know what? 

You wouldn't help me. You would believe me, do me a big favor. I didn't have much to lose so I don't go all this through. I would be [INAUDIBLE] already for so many years it would be a big help for me. He said, I help you. Why don't you help me? What can I do for him? 

SUBJECT 1: By the-- when I was by the Russian it's very, very big problem when you give affidavit you will [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. 

SUBJECT 2: You see, that's-- that's another thing. He always-- we said to him when he is going to grow grass-- 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: --then you're going to go to Israel. 

SUBJECT 1: That's right. 

SUBJECT 2: And he kept-- that's what he told them. 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: He always went in and he was risk with his life. He always went in there and applied to go to Israel. And they said to him, you take two stones and take your hat and beat out the stupid things from your head because you're never going to go. 

SUBJECT 1: That's right. 

INTERVIEWER: Who told you this? 

Didn't The-- the-- 

SUBJECT 1: The Russian soldiers. The Russian government. 

SUBJECT 2: The Russian government said to him, you're never want to see Israel. You're never going to go out there. You're an idiot or you're crazy. 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: What's the matter with you? 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: But he didn't give up and that's why I'm mad of him now. I said, look, you went so much through. This is incredible. I believe you everything, but you have to help yourself. 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: Help yourself. Nobody-- you know, I have my own problems-- 

SUBJECT 1: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: --and I wouldn't live with my husband, but he went through so much he would leave me one day in a long time, too, because I have my temper and my problems. But besides this, I don't leave out my problems to the people not where I work-- at work, yes, when they touch me and I'm nervous, I give them back. But on the other hand, you have to control yourself. Control yourself. 

INTERVIEWER: Was your brother a healthy boy before this happened? Was he healthy in every way? 

SUBJECT 2: Sure, he was healthy. And not just besides this. That's what it hurts me more. You see, I'm yelling and I'm screaming because it hurts me. He was so loyal, he worked so-- he-- I think nobody would keep a job like him. He would do anything. Nothing was hard for him. And today everything is a problem and nobody wants to know. 

And who should know? Who can you expect? You have to go and help yourself. But on the other hand I'm wrong, I know I'm wrong. It's not just-- you see, like I can't-- or he's-- I don't know. I can't figure it out. I'm not the doctor. I'm not a psychologist.
