SUBJECT 3: --have to wait. 

INTERVIEWER: OK, we're just-- when-- just let us know. 

CREW: --rolling. 

INTERVIEWER: OK. 

SUBJECT 2: My name is Kurt Koral, and I was born in Vienna, in 1937. Um-- my memories of the-- of the, uh, Catholic orphanage that I went to, um, there was a, a, a-- 

INTERVIEWER: The first memories. 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, of the Catholic one, or of the, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: Judenrat. 

SUBJECT 2: The first-- first memories, I really think, are of, of the, um, of the Jewish orphanage that I was-- that I was in. And that was just being cooped up in a room, at night, and, I think, most of the day, with a bunch of, uh, kids. A relatively small room, full of bunk beds, up and down, in rows. Of constant noise and tumult, most of the day. But not any particular fear or, um, trepidation. 

And, um, the fact that there was a kid above me that, most nights, would-- would-- would find that he had to urinate while he was asleep, and I would get wet. And I would constantly run and complain to, uh, one of the authorities. To which they paid very little attention to, apparently. 

And, uh, um, I don't remember getting there. I don't remember getting out. I remember something about, I think, the room that we lived in, that there was a stove. It was-- I think there were two rooms. Was there one room? 

SUBJECT 3: It's the one room, and the kitchen. 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, well, we stayed mostly in the kitchen. I think that's because where the stove was. 

SUBJECT 3: Right. 

SUBJECT 2: And I don't particularly remember being hungry or-- or thirsty. 

SUBJECT 3: Whatever we had, we gave for him, even-- 

SUBJECT 1: We didn't eat. We gave it to him. 

SUBJECT 2: I remember either reading stories, or being read to. Um, I don't remember going out or playing at all. 

SUBJECT 3: At what? 

SUBJECT 2: The street. 

SUBJECT 1: Playing, no. 

SUBJECT 3: No. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: Always in the room. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: No, because I told him, look here, it's dangerous to go-- first of all, you had some, uh, gentile, uh, kids. And he was afraid they would point out something, you know, that he's Jewish. So-- 

SUBJECT 2: Did I have to wear a star, too? 

SUBJECT 1: Wear, you, too. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah, I'd remember, yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: You, too. Yeah. You were already five years old or you were something like this. So you had to wear a star, too. 

INTERVIEWER: And, when you asked him not to go out, he just accepted this? 

SUBJECT 1: He accepted this. 

SUBJECT 3: He accepted this, and he-- 

SUBJECT 1: And, probably, he didn't ask questions. He realized that something is wrong. He didn't know-- he didn't think something like this could happen, probably, in his mind, as a child. Didn't realize it. But I told him, look, it's, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: He wanted very badly to read. 

SUBJECT 1: You see, and we told him, look, they want to kill us, you know? 

SUBJECT 3: And you have to. 

SUBJECT 1: You have to be in the house, and you can get out. We-- we are hiding. Probably he didn't understand that, either. But he knew that he has to stay in the house, and that's all. And be quiet, and not demand. And he didn't demand anything. Whatever we gave him, he was satisfied. 

He, he didn't like [INAUDIBLE] I don't like milk, or whatever. Whatever we gave him, he was happy about-- 

SUBJECT 3: He was pleased. 

SUBJECT 1: --this. 

SUBJECT 3: And then, in our neighbor-- 

INTERVIEWER: He wanted to read? 

SUBJECT 3: Yes, he wanted so badly to read, and he didn't go to schools. So in our neighborhood was also a Jewish family, and they had a little girl which was a little older than Kurt. So she came up to our house, and she taught him to read-- and also mathematic, a little bit. 

SUBJECT 1: This was after the, after Hitler. 

SUBJECT 3: I don't think so. After Hitler, went to school. 

SUBJECT 1: After Hitler, went to school. 

SUBJECT 3: So, and he was very, very anxious to know how to read. And slowly she taught him a little bit. And so he-- comic books, or thing like this, he was looking and reading. And that how he, uh-- 

SUBJECT 2: Struwwelpeter. 

SUBJECT 3: [LAUGHS] 

SUBJECT 1: Struwwelpeter. 

SUBJECT 3: Struwwelpeter, yeah. It's a-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: No, no, no, Struwwelpeter was something else. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah? 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, Struwwelpeter was something else. 

SUBJECT 3: So, anyhow, he was very good child. I must say so. He didn't ask too many questions and was satisfied whatever we could give him. And maybe he realized that we did the best, but he didn't talk about it. 

INTERVIEWER: Did he look frightened, sometimes? 

SUBJECT 3: No, he didn't look frightened. 

SUBJECT 1: I don't know he was frightened. 

SUBJECT 3: And I'm sure, when we took-- gave him away, he must have been very, very sad. But I didn't show it, because I felt only one thing about it, sad. 

SUBJECT 1: He was crying, he was crying. 

SUBJECT 3: I just wanted to save his life, no matter how or what. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you feel, when you first gave him away to the-- 

SUBJECT 3: I couldn't sleep a whole night, and I was crying. But I didn't show it. When I gave him away, I didn't cry. I said, you're going to have a nice time. And then I left him in the cloister. 

SUBJECT 1: It was a time we didn't care about our life. It's only-- 

SUBJECT 3: That's all. 

SUBJECT 1: --for the child, that's all. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: We wanted to save-- our purpose was only to save him. We gave up our-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: Because we-- we knew, soon it was a, a miracle that we are alive. 

SUBJECT 3: --Belgian people-- 

SUBJECT 1: Our whole, uh, being is only miracles, you know? 

SUBJECT 3: Belgian people came back from Germany, they worked there, and they told me, you know what they do? They kill Jewish people. I said, I don't believe that. I will never believe that. I couldn't believe it, that a thing like this would happen. 

SUBJECT 1: Our purpose was only to save him. And we gave him all kind of places-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: --maybe's a chance he will be-- he will be saved. 

SUBJECT 3: And, uh, then, then, one day-- 

SUBJECT 1: You see, our feeling, I can't describe, because it was a terrible-- I used to-- what I told you, I went to visit him. I, I I risked my life, you know? Because it was dangerous to them. Because had to wear-- 

SUBJECT 3: We had to hide the-- 

SUBJECT 1: I had to wear a star, and I had to cover the star. 

SUBJECT 3: Otherwise-- 

SUBJECT 1: --because Jews were not allowed to travel at all. So finally we came to the cloister, and I saw him, the situation, there. And he was crying. So imagine what happened-- 

SUBJECT 3: He cried, and he was holding on a packet-- 

SUBJECT 1: And I was crying, too. You imagine-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: And I felt, I don't care-- 

SUBJECT 1: This is not to describe-- I mean, the feelings-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: And I felt, even he cries, whatever, as long as he's safe, I didn't care. 

INTERVIEWER: That was the time that he was in the-- 

SUBJECT 3: Cloister. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: Right, yeah, the cloister. 

SUBJECT 2: Well, it was a convent. 

SUBJECT 3: A convent, yeah. And-- 

SUBJECT 1: And, I must say, they saved-- they risked their lives. We had a German nun. And one day-- 

SUBJECT 3: One night-- 

SUBJECT 1: --somehow, they-- the Gestapo found out that, uh, there are Jewish kids-- 

SUBJECT 3: In the cloister. 

SUBJECT 1: And they had tunnels there. And she took him-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: The Jewish children-- 

SUBJECT 1: --the Jewish children through a tunnel. 

SUBJECT 3: And hide them. 

SUBJECT 1: And they'd hide him. 

SUBJECT 3: And the Gestapo came in, and they couldn't find any Jewish children. And, uh, and they all were cripples, there. That's how the cloister was recording. 

And, one day, I was staying in line. I will never forget that. And-- for bread. And, all of a sudden, a woman friend of mine comes running-- don't stay here. We are liberated. We are liberated. 

I said, I cannot believe it. She says yes, yes, yes. And, all of a sudden, we saw the American army coming in, and the English soldiers, and everybody-- 

SUBJECT 1: It was-- not too many people were-- 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. And then we looked at each other, and we went in the streets-- Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. And we kissed our-- we never saw each other before, and everybody kissed everybody. 

SUBJECT 1: We had about 40,000, uh, uh, in Brussels, we had over 20,000 Jewish people, there. And-- 

SUBJECT 2: Left over after the war. 

SUBJECT 1: Hmm? 

SUBJECT 2: You mean, after the war. 

SUBJECT 1: No, no, no-- 

SUBJECT 2: Before the war? 

SUBJECT 3: Before? 

SUBJECT 1: Before the war. 

SUBJECT 2: That's all? 

SUBJECT 1: There were-- but Brussels-- Belgium didn't have too many-- the whole Jewish population was-- 

INTERVIEWER: Let's come back to your memory of the-- 

SUBJECT 2: Well, memories of the convent are also pretty dim. But, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER: Even, like, leaving your parents and going there? 

SUBJECT 2: No. 

SUBJECT 3: I left him there. 

SUBJECT 2: I don't remember leaving my parents and going there. I remember being there. I remember that, that, that, that there was always a lot of room there. That, um-- 

INTERVIEWER: What did it look like? 

SUBJECT 2: To me, it looked large. 

SUBJECT 1: It was rather huge. 

SUBJECT 2: Huge rooms, tall, tall ceilings, cool, most of the time. Uh-- your own bed, uh, with quite a distance between, between, between children. Um, a very, uh, um, strict daily routine. 

You got up in the morning, and you prayed. And-- and you went to breakfast, and, and, and, and, and, and you prayed, and, uh-- as a matter of fact, uh, even when we went to the toilet, we usually went to the toilet-- there was a sort of time when, when you went to the toilet-- unless you had to go another time. 

But there was sort of a time that, after all the kids went to the toilet, at night, and, and, and, they would sit in the bathroom, and they-- and, and they would pray. And, um-- 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any of the prayers? 

SUBJECT 2: No. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: He told us-- had told us, when I pray, I pray in, in-- 

SUBJECT 3: Shema Yisrael. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: --night, uh-- 

SUBJECT 1: That what he told us. 

SUBJECT 3: He says, even so she tells me, and then she leaves, and-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: And you remember, you told us, uh, they gave me pota-- I am hungry, I don't get food anything, I get only potatoes? 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah-- 

SUBJECT 2: Mustard, I remember I missed mustard. 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. He-- when I came, he thought I'm going to take him home. And he tells me he has no butter or no mustard. He cried to-- take me home. They only give me decent-- 

So he thought I'm going to take him home. But that, uh, was out of questions. I had to leave him there. So it was very, very hard to leave him and go not see him for four weeks. 

But I didn't think like this, because I figured as long as he's safe-- 

INTERVIEWER: How often did you visit him? 

SUBJECT 3: Every four weeks. We had-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: No, lately, he didn't go alone, because men was more dangerous. So I went with that other woman. She had a little girl there. But there's still a lot of children there, which parents didn't come home. 

INTERVIEWER: In other words, if the parents didn't return, the child-- 

SUBJECT 3: She told me this. You have to sign, if you want your husband-- 

SUBJECT 1: No, I had to sign, if, in case, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: We are-- 

SUBJECT 1: --we are not existing anymore, the child, the child belongs to the-- 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah, but I still told-- told my non-Jewish friend, I gave him the address from my people in Israel, my father and mother and for my sister there. She had all the addresses. And she told me, when we're not going to be alive, she will connect the people, tell them where my child is. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you know you were a different child, a Jewish child? 

SUBJECT 3: Of course. 

SUBJECT 2: I-- I think so. I think so. 

INTERVIEWER: What do you mean? 

SUBJECT 2: Do you mean, at that point? Uh-- I'm not sure. I'm not sure. First of all, I had visitors. The other children didn't have visitors. Um-- I remember crying, when my parents left. But one-- one of the nuns would take me over and, uh, bring me to some place where children were playing. And, after a while-- 

SUBJECT 3: Forgot-- she told me-- 

SUBJECT 2: --I would just join in the games, and, and, and, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: She told me, don't be-- don't think that he's crying. He cries now right away when you go away-- 

SUBJECT 2: I don't remember any other children, I don't remember, had friends or didn't have friends-- uh, any of that. Again, I don't remember, uh, crying all the time or anything like that. Or, um, being maltreated in any way. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any of the nuns or more or teachers more? 

SUBJECT 2: I don't remember. I just remember them, that, that there was a lot of limping. And that they were sort of short and squat, most of the time. But I don't remember anything much. 

SUBJECT 1: They had to pray. There is no teaching. Praying a lot. 

SUBJECT 2: The one thing that-- that I did enjoy is, I would enjoy, apparently somewhere, I don't remember whether it was once a day or once a week, a priest would come in. And he would hold a more formal service in one of the chapels. And that was always a kind of dramatic kind of thing, because there was a lot of ritual and a lot of color and incense and singing. 

And I used to look forward to those particular occasions. Even though I kind of knew that I didn't really believe in all this, and that-- didn't really belong to it. But it still was rather fascinating. 

SUBJECT 3: I know there were other Jewish children, also, but not in the same cloister. And, after the liberation, they always went to the church. They couldn't forget the thing that could pass. He always went to the church later. He just, for weeks and months, he just was fascinated with the church. 

INTERVIEWER: How-- what was a day like? What were holidays like, in that monastery? 

SUBJECT 2: I don't think there were any holid-- I don't think there were any differences between days, that I remember. 

INTERVIEWER: Christmas? 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: I don't know if I was there that long. Was I there that long? Did I wait till Christmas? 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 3: I don't remember. 

SUBJECT 1: Sure, you had Christmas there. 

SUBJECT 3: In fact, after-- after the liberation, he went out-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: I don't remember any holidays. I don't remember one day different from any other day. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? We're talking- you were there between '43 and-- 

SUBJECT 3: Maybe '45? 

SUBJECT 1: Till the liberation. 

INTERVIEWER: --'45? 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: '44, end of '44. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: Two years. 

SUBJECT 1: Two years he was there. 

SUBJECT 2: It's mostly a blank. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 3: That's it. He was, uh, he wasn't a very young children there, and so-- 

SUBJECT 2: Mostly a blank. 

INTERVIEWER: Anything? 

SUBJECT 2: Hmm-mm. 

SUBJECT 3: Remember, after the liberation, you went to play-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, but that's befo-- that's, that's, that's-- 

SUBJECT 3: I just want to bring up that they still said "schmutziger Jude." And he came up, and he cried. 

SUBJECT 2: Well, that was-- that was afterwards. 

SUBJECT 3: After. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember your parents' visit? 

SUBJECT 2: I just remember it as, you know, as a time that I cried, and, uh, I didn't want them to, didn't want my mother to go. And, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER: How do you remember your mother, in those days? What did she look like? What's the image that comes back to you? 

SUBJECT 2: I don't know. It's-- it's hard to separate her then from the way she looks now. [LAUGHS] Or, now, the way she looked then, or whatever. 

INTERVIEWER: Can you describe her? 

SUBJECT 2: That's very difficult. Yeah, really, it-- I don't have a memory then that's different from what she looks like now. If I had-- if somebody said, that's the way she looked then, how she looked now. 

INTERVIEWER: Your father, that-- 

SUBJECT 2: Same. 

SUBJECT 3: Remember when Dolfie came? That was Dolfie. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, the liberation. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

INTERVIEWER: Anything ever happen, during those years? I think there were other incidents. 

SUBJECT 2: The-- the various people that I, that I, I was with are sort of a blur. You know, as, as, uh, just going from one place to another. And I thought-- I think it became a routine. You know, that's what you did. You went from one place to another. 

So it wasn't-- it wasn't a terrible shock, I think, to go from one place to another. It changed things. It was-- it was the way you lived. It's-- 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 3: There were certain accidents, like, uh, when we were hidden-- what is his name? Pappenheim? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, he-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: There was still Kurt with us. 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, didn't the Rosenbergs live across the hall? 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 2: Throughout the whole war. 

SUBJECT 3: Yes, the whole war, yes. 

SUBJECT 2: There was another Jewish family that lived on the same floor. 

SUBJECT 3: Same floor like we, and her son was also hidden in a cloister. And, uh-- 

SUBJECT 2: I don't-- I don't remember whether it was before the war or after the war, but he used to have a map. 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: Rosenberg had a map. 

SUBJECT 2: And I think he used to listen to the radio-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: --underground radio, Allied radio. And he would have thumbtacks as to where he heard on the radio, where-- actually where the Allies were or where they were bombing. And he had these multicolored little tacks on-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: And we were discussing about it. And suddenly Gestapo came in-- 

SUBJECT 3: Oh, yes. 

SUBJECT 1: And, uh-- Gestapo came in-- 

SUBJECT 3: Somebody was knocking on the door. Yes? And they said, the Gestapo. And we opened up. 

He says, what are you doing here? I said, nothing. That wasn't the real Gestapo. After this, we found out this was the, uh, how do you call it? 

SUBJECT 1: Underground is what it was called. 

SUBJECT 3: Underground. They just wanted to see how we lived. And we were so afraid. And so they left and didn't do anything. 

And they went into the other room, where that man was, with a map. And he says, it's late. He says to the other woman, it's after 6:00 or 7:00-- 

SUBJECT 1: You don't belong here-- 

SUBJECT 3: You don't belong here. Go home. And we thought it's the Gestapo. They were dressed like this, but they were underground. And they wanted just to find out how Jewish people lived, or whatever. They wanted-- didn't say what they wanted. 

And, uh, what else is there? [LAUGHS] There's so many accident like that. 

INTERVIEWER: You were, all this time, in illegal-- 

SUBJECT 3: Illegal. 

SUBJECT 1: Always illegal. 

INTERVIEWER: --during those two years. 

SUBJECT 2: But in the same place. 

SUBJECT 1: No, no, no. 

SUBJECT 3: Not always in the same place. One day, we were in Rue Lenee, and all of a sudden we heard the stiefeln, the Gestapo. So we had a young man who lived by-- he was a very religious guy. 

SUBJECT 1: He sacrificed his life. 

SUBJECT 3: He says, you come up with me on the roof, in the mansarde. And you stay-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: --you stay with your child there. 

SUBJECT 1: And I will stay in the room. When they come, they should take-- 

SUBJECT 3: They shall take me, and not you and the child. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: --this way, we saved-- and it was-- 

SUBJECT 3: They save-- he saved us, through that. 

INTERVIEWER: And he was taken? 

SUBJECT 3: Yes, he was taken. Was a very religious boy, wasn't married, a young fellow. He says, you go up there-- 

SUBJECT 1: Do you remember him? 

SUBJECT 3: --because you have the child. 

SUBJECT 2: No. 

SUBJECT 3: No. Father Pappenheim, his name was. A very nice guy. 

SUBJECT 1: This wasn't-- now in this-- but this was-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. There was another apartment, yeah. And we had no bathroom or anything. We had just a little, um, basin. And we bathed all in the same water, [LAUGHS] in the same everything. 

And still and all, when you think of it, with not the right [INAUDIBLE], everybody was well. We were not as close to danger here. 

INTERVIEWER: What else do you remember of your life? 

SUBJECT 2: You mean, before the-- uh, liberation, or-- 

INTERVIEWER: Before the liberation, of anything, the moment of liberation? 

SUBJECT 2: The only thing I remember about the moment of liberation-- 

INTERVIEWER: Nothing before? 

SUBJECT 2: I don't think so. 

INTERVIEWER: Something about a-- a horse and a cart, and-- 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, that-- that was much earlier. That-- that was-- my parents, uh, remember that. 

SUBJECT 3: The what? 

SUBJECT 2: About, uh, when you, when you were fleeing from, from Belgium to France. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, yeah. I remember --. And the French-- the, the French soldiers took him. And then I realized, I give this hat away-- 

SUBJECT 3: You're never going to see-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: --how can I-- I don't know the people. For the moment, I wanted only-- my [INAUDIBLE]-- only to save him. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: Desperate. 

SUBJECT 1: We was able take him, because they didn't want to take us. You see? So, I figured, maybe they will save him. 

Then I realized, maybe I will have a chance, this way, this-- I wouldn't have a chance to see him anymore. So I ran out after this, and I said-- begged him, give me back the child. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 1: And then, the story, the Germans came in, and-- and the story she told you about. 

INTERVIEWER: I'm talking about a-- specifically a horse and a couple of things that you mentioned to me, once, being on a, on a cart drawn by a horse. 

SUBJECT 3: Not once. 

SUBJECT 2: I think that was-- that was on the farms, where I was on hay-- on these, on these hay carts. Uh, during that time when I was outdoors. [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 3: That was when we were-- 

SUBJECT 1: They liked him very much-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: That's when we-- 

SUBJECT 3: Six months, on the farm. 

SUBJECT 2: --stopped at that farmhouse, on the-- I guess, on the way, when the train was on the way to, uh, to-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: --and then Stalingrad occurred or something. But the only memory I have of that time at all is, is, is somehow being outdoor, and being on hay, and carts pulled by horses. And, and, and that's it. It's just sort of a pastoral scene, with, with-- 

I don't remember who they were or what they were or what the houses looked like or-- or anything. 

INTERVIEWER: And you were going on about, uh, the moment of liberation? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah. If I remember, something-- it was something like, uh, we were looking out at the streets, and somebody first came and said, uh, the Allies are here. Then people pulled out-- 

SUBJECT 3: You have to go back-- 

SUBJECT 2: --flags. And they said, no, the Allies aren't here. And then everybody took their flags in. And, and, and, and, and-- 

SUBJECT 3: Take a few-- 

SUBJECT 2: --and there was a sort of an excitement and an anxiety, whether, were they were really being liberated? Were they not being liberated? Because, uh-- 

SUBJECT 1: Do you remember from the V-1 or V-2? 

SUBJECT 3: That was later. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: Well, that was later. 

SUBJECT 1: That was later. 

SUBJECT 3: And, after the liberation, we thought we are very safe. Then there came, uh, the V-1 and V-2, from Amsterdam, they-- what do you call, the-- 

SUBJECT 2: Where did we go-- uh, we went to someplace when there were bombings. 

SUBJECT 3: In the cellar? 

SUBJECT 2: Of the house across the street. 

SUBJECT 1: Across the street, yeah. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: She take. 

SUBJECT 3: You know, when they were bombing, we had to run. So we ran. Across the street was a modern house. And they had facilities, where you were hid-- we could stay in the cellar. 

Also, when we were auf der-- auf der Flucht, flight, one night when we were-- when this was going on, uh, they said-- there was other man, but not-- non-Jewish man. But they were also afraid for the German people. 

So they said to my husband, you and me leave the women and children here, and we go swimming to-- 

SUBJECT 1: Because they will-- they kill the man. 

SUBJECT 3: We go swimming through the canal-- 

SUBJECT 1: --to the Albert Canal. You heard about the Albert Canal? That's a big, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: Water, lake-- 

SUBJECT 1: --like, uh, a big canal. And we-- 

SUBJECT 3: So the men decided-- 

SUBJECT 1: So we came to the canal, and I saw people go swimming, and they drowned. So I got scared. And I didn't go into the water, and I didn't know where she is-- 

SUBJECT 3: Where we are-- 

SUBJECT 1: Where we left her-- 

SUBJECT 3: --in between-- 

SUBJECT 1: So I was running, for two days-- 

SUBJECT 3: Looking for us. 

SUBJECT 1: Were looking, and finally I got them. And they-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: And we, in between bombardments, came, and we had to be in the cellar. And they all spoke French, and I didn't know, and I was holding on to my child, and I was praying. 

INTERVIEWER: That was what year? 

SUBJECT 3: I was praying-- 

INTERVIEWER: Yeah, what-- 

SUBJECT 3: --to God, that everything should be all right. And, after two days, he came back, all knocked out in this. And then the German came. 

SUBJECT 1: Day and night, I was running through woods-- 

SUBJECT 3: They did not remember the place where they left us. 

SUBJECT 1: --and I asked farmers-- I didn't know where they-- where she was. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: That was when we had the flucht. 

SUBJECT 1: --I was lucky I found them. 

INTERVIEWER: That was when you were with the farmers. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: And the-- now, eh, did you-- uh, did Kurt stay in the convent until the liberation? 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 3: Few days, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: A few days? 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. A day-- yeah. A-- the liberation. Before a few days, I don't know why, but he came out a few days before. And then there was the liberation. We know, every minute-- 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember leaving the convent? 

SUBJECT 2: No. 

SUBJECT 3: He doesn't. 

SUBJECT 2: Didn't you tell me that, by that time, Germans had already come over-- come to you, to see if you could hide them-- German soldiers, or something? 

SUBJECT 3: Oh, yeah, right. 

SUBJECT 2: Stopped you on the streets? 

SUBJECT 3: On the-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, when the liberation came, and I went-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: Before the liberation. 

SUBJECT 3: Before, a few-- a few-- a few hours before-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, I went down, because I have seen, uh, uh, this, uh, a flag-- 

SUBJECT 3: Already. 

SUBJECT 1: --you see American flag I saw. I figured, we are liberated. And I come on the street. I see it's empty. 

SUBJECT 3: A German. 

SUBJECT 1: A German soldier who tells me, maybe you have clothes-- 

INTERVIEWER: I want to hide. 

SUBJECT 1: I want-- I want to hide. [LAUGHS] Not to be a prisoner of war. I am afraid of the Americans. So-- 

SUBJECT 3: He said, no-- 

SUBJECT 1: I was still-- and five minutes later, they tell me the Germans are still here. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah, it was a-- 

SUBJECT 1: A false alarm. 

SUBJECT 3: --a few hours, until it really came the liberation. Off and on, yes and no, and, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER: What did you think, when the German asked you for the-- the clothes? 

SUBJECT 1: I mean, I didn't-- I-- I ran away. [LAUGHS] I was scared. You know, I was scared. Then it was a beautiful scene, when the liberation came. This I will never forget. This was something out. And we were dancing-- 

SUBJECT 3: So happy, so happy. 

SUBJECT 1: --and crying. 

SUBJECT 3: Three days and three nights, we were all in the streets. And people were kissing each other and screaming and, oh, you're a Jew, you're a Jew-- 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, you are alive. You see, we met people-- you are alive. 

SUBJECT 3: And then, when the American soldiers came, some of them wanted to know our whole story. And they wanted to come up to our house and ask how many people and what we went through. They wanted everything to know-- how many Jewish people are here, so. 

That was it. What else? There might be some other thing which I don't remember. 

INTERVIEWER: What-- when you-- do you remember, one, leaving-- both of you-- leaving Kurt, in the monastery, and what you thought, and then taking him back? What was it like to bring him there and to leave him? 

SUBJECT 1: It was a terrible problem, I mean the-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: --when we came back. 

SUBJECT 3: It was very bad. But I don't know, I didn't think so, but-- 

SUBJECT 1: When we gave him away to them, it was bad. But we were desperate. We did-- 

SUBJECT 3: But I was glad to find a place. Somebody recommended, and I was happy to find a place. 

SUBJECT 1: I figured, maybe they will save him. 

SUBJECT 3: You didn't think like you would think that, oh my god, take my child-- 

SUBJECT 1: Try to get him back or something. 

SUBJECT 3: I wanted to save-- 

SUBJECT 1: We only, our purpose was only to save his-- to save him, that's all. 

SUBJECT 3: That's what we all had in our mind. 

SUBJECT 1: Everything else was meaningless. 

SUBJECT 3: And even so he cried, so I didn't cry. It was so hard. I just figured, I don't care if he has food or not, as long as he is saved. 

INTERVIEWER: Now, over those two years or less that you were illegal-- 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: --there were transports, all the time? 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: All the-- all the time. 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: It was, every night they came in the evening-- 

SUBJECT 3: In the houses. 

SUBJECT 1: --with-- with trucks. We had a Jewish traitor. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: You know? 

SUBJECT 2: Yeah, Jacques. 

SUBJECT 1: Jack, Jack. This you remember. 

SUBJECT 2: You told me his name. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, he remembers-- 

SUBJECT 2: That wasn't his real name, though. 

SUBJECT 3: And he really-- 

SUBJECT 1: And he recognized-- 

SUBJECT 3: He recognized their faces. 

SUBJECT 1: I had false papers, you know? Belgian papers, in case they catch me. I show them that I'm, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 1: --I'm a Belgian, I'm a Gentile, or something. I had a different name. But he recognized by the way. 

SUBJECT 3: He recognized the faces. 

SUBJECT 1: He knew-- you see, the fear what we had in us, you see? If we went on the streets, we had a different-- you see, we looked around where-- I mean-- and he knew that. 

SUBJECT 3: He became a traitor, that's what they said, because they took his wife and his children, and-- 

SUBJECT 1: He was so bad, I tell you, when the Gestapo came and saw him, I was told, I didn't experience this-- that they came up, and sometimes there were children inside. And the Gestapo man had a little bit, you know-- 

SUBJECT 3: More-- 

SUBJECT 1: --feelings about-- 

SUBJECT 3: Pity-- 

SUBJECT 1: And he said, take him. And the funny part of this, they took away his wife and children, and he became a traitor. 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: Then he was, uh-- 

SUBJECT 3: They killed him, on the end. 

SUBJECT 1: They killed him, anyhow-- 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: --in the end. 

INTERVIEWER: You were initially wearing the stars, so you were not illegal. 

SUBJECT 3: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 1: No, we had-- anyhow, when they catch me, because we had to wear the star, in case they catch us. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 1: They used to beat up, if somebody took off the star. 

SUBJECT 3: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT 1: They came in the-- and they caught you in the apartment. And you didn't wear the star-- 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 1: --you know? They, they beated you up. So you were afraid. You had to wear the star. 

INTERVIEWER: So the star, you wore all the-- 

SUBJECT 1: All the time. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. And when I went shopping-- 

SUBJECT 1: When I went on the streets, I had-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 3: You have to hide it. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: --I covered it, like this. 

INTERVIEWER: How did you avoid being caught? And, uh-- 

SUBJECT 1: It was luck. It's not-- 

SUBJECT 3: Just a matter of luck. 

SUBJECT 1: It's nothing special. It's luck, that's all. 

SUBJECT 3: Couldn't be smart. It was a matter of luck. And, um, I don't know. 

INTERVIEWER: Well, one of the things is that-- that-- 

SUBJECT 1: I went, once, down to buy something, shopping. And I was lucky, and-- shouldn't give to see to Gestapo man. And they start to question me. And-- and I-- I was holding this, like this-- they didn't see it. 

You are Jewish? Where is your star? I couldn't let him move my hands. You know? Because I was scared. And they had a little bit, you know-- 

SUBJECT 3: Some of them. 

SUBJECT 1: They felt a little bit this he said, go-- go home. Next time, don't go down. 

SUBJECT 3: We were supposed to go in certain hours only. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 3: You wanted to say something, Kurt. 

SUBJECT 2: I forgot what I was going to say. 

SUBJECT 1: Hmm? 

SUBJECT 2: Oh, what I was going to say is that you went into hiding relatively early, didn't you? before you even had to go in hiding. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: Because you would register with the Jewish community, right? The Judenrat? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah, yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: And they hadn't told you to go into hiding yet. 

SUBJECT 3: No. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: They had just-- they would-- they would just generally round up people or tell them to go here or there, depending on what-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: --one day-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: --they gave you no advice at all. But-- 

SUBJECT 3: No. 

SUBJECT 1: --but you-- you, you kind of severed a relationship with him. You no longer reported there. You just went into hiding. 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 2: And they no longer knew where you were or 

SUBJECT 3: No, no. 

SUBJECT 2: --existed. 

SUBJECT 3: Because when they found the list, it wouldn't be good. 

INTERVIEWER: What did you live on? 

SUBJECT 1: Luck. I had a little bit silver. I had a little bit, and I had-- 

SUBJECT 3: Once my husband-- was hast du verkauft, you know, when you sold, uh-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: This was at liberation. But, during that time, we had a little bit silver and a little gold, sometimes. And we had a, a grocery store, downstairs, in the hiding place, do you remember? 

And I gave him this, and he gave me food. 

SUBJECT 3: Food. 

INTERVIEWER: And he knew-- 

SUBJECT 1: [INAUDIBLE] Yes, some-- 

INTERVIEWER: --he knew-- 

SUBJECT 1: He knew. 

SUBJECT 3: Some of them, especially-- 

SUBJECT 1: A matter of fact-- 

SUBJECT 2: A lot of people in the neighborhood knew. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. But, you see, they did-- they hated the Germans, you know? 

SUBJECT 3: They hated the Germans terrible, because-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: Not because they liked us, but they hided-- 

SUBJECT 3: They liked us more than-- 

SUBJECT 1: They covered us up, more or less. 

SUBJECT 3: Some of them. 

SUBJECT 1: Some of them. 

INTERVIEWER: Will you-- 

SUBJECT 1: You see, we had-- Belgium had two languages, you know, Walloons and, and-- 

SUBJECT 3: Flemish. 

INTERVIEWER: In the apartment that you lived, did you have a name? 

SUBJECT 1: No. What do you mean, "a name"? 

SUBJECT 3: How could we have a name? They would-- no. 

INTERVIEWER: There was an apartment that had no name-- 

SUBJECT 1: No name at all. 

SUBJECT 3: No name. No name. 

SUBJECT 1: Didn't exist, a name. What do you mean, "a name"? 

INTERVIEWER: Even not your false name. 

SUBJECT 1: Did-- not the false-- nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. A matter, the name, we didn't go out. We didn't go out, only the-- we were lucky, he w-- had a [INAUDIBLE]-- 

SUBJECT 3: There was a grocer in the same building. 

SUBJECT 1: In the same building. And he, he was a nice fellow. And he brought us up-- we paid him, naturally. 

INTERVIEWER: And you didn't go out for how many months? 

SUBJECT 1: Four months we didn't go out. 

SUBJECT 3: That's how the Pappenheim said, why don't you pray every day-- gives you something to do? Remember? 

INTERVIEWER: But you did go out, though, to visit the child. 

SUBJECT 3: He didn't go, later. I was only by myself, when I went. 

SUBJECT 1: And I didn't go out, the beginning-- the first time, I went there. And this was a big-- everybody tells me it's a risk. But I figured, look, I want to see him once in a while. 

SUBJECT 3: Once, but then he didn't go, because-- 

SUBJECT 1: I want to see him once-- 

INTERVIEWER: Once more? 

SUBJECT 3: Yes. 

SUBJECT 1: [SNIFFS] 

INTERVIEWER: Yes? 

SUBJECT 3: What else is there? Hmm? There are little things. I don't-- 

INTERVIEWER: What-- why-- what was saddening? 

SUBJECT 3: Hmm? 

SUBJECT 1: I don't know [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you, over those two years, think that you will not see him again? 

SUBJECT 3: Oh, he knew-- 

SUBJECT 1: Sure. Definite, yeah. Definite. When I gave him to the cloister, I figured I will never see him again. 

SUBJECT 3: We could have-- every minute of our life was in danger. Every minute. 

SUBJECT 1: Every, every, every hour it was in danger. They closed up streets, and, you know, they went in every house-- 

SUBJECT 3: Every house-- 

SUBJECT 1: --to look, to look for, for-- 

SUBJECT 3: Jewish people. 

SUBJECT 1: --for Jewish people. And, uh, I don't blame the gen-- I mean, the, the, the landlords. They were afraid, too, because it was death penalty in all kind if you hide a Jew. 

So some, some sacrificed themselves, let's say, at the grocery store. He said, they came in, he said, we don't have any-- any Jews. 

SUBJECT 3: They hated the German people so much that they-- 

SUBJECT 1: Because they hated very much. They had experience in 1918 or '19. And they lost probably. So they said, no, we don't have any Jews. 

But, uh, we did never figured that we-- 

SUBJECT 3: Were going to be alive. 

SUBJECT 1: --we, we will see him again. 

INTERVIEWER: What-- after the liberation, did you-- when you came back to the family, what was it like? 

SUBJECT 2: The only impression I remember is that, for the first time, I would-- I would go into the streets and play with children. I went to school. 

SUBJECT 3: Started school. 

SUBJECT 2: And it was, I think, also the first time that I, that I felt that I was different. Because, even in the orphanages, I, I, I don't remember feeling that I was different from anybody else. I had visitors, and my mother came to visit me. But I-- somehow, that didn't associate with anything. 

But, when I, when I went to school, and when I played with other children, and there were very few Jewish children in the school. I think in my class there were none. And I was older, I think, than everybody else. I was two years older. 

And, um, I was the class Jew. Sometimes that was kind of in a praiseworthy way. A lot of times it was an epithet. 

SUBJECT 3: I mean, you played once-- 

SUBJECT 2: Yes, if I got into an argument with anybody, it was always "dirty Jew." 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah, he came up and says, she told him-- said, wait. Wait. They're leaving soon for America-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: But the teachers praised him, and they like him. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 1: He was the best-- the best student. He have still-- 

[INTERPOSING VOICES] 

SUBJECT 1: [INAUDIBLE] And he used to-- 

SUBJECT 3: He came up, and he says, they said I'm a schmutziger Jude. 

SUBJECT 1: And he took-- uh, he spoke fluently already French. 

SUBJECT 3: Yeah. 

SUBJECT 2: Mhm. 

SUBJECT 1: In a short time, he picked it up very fast. Today not, but he was bright, his age. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you in any way remember, think of the cloister? 

SUBJECT 2: Do I think of it? 

SUBJECT 1: It's a huge building. 

SUBJECT 3: No. 

SUBJECT 2: I-- I do re-- I don't have any dreams about it, that I'm aware of, particularly. Uh-- I still have a kind of, uh, uh, sort of a fascination for Catholicism, and for the ritual. 

SUBJECT 3: A lot of people have that. 

SUBJECT 2: And, uh, you know, when I go into a-- especially if I'm in Europe-- I haven't gone to any churches. But if I'm in Europe, and visiting a church, there's sort of a feeling, an odor, an atmosphere comes back. 

INTERVIEWER: Mhm? 

SUBJECT 2: But that's about, uh, about all. 

INTERVIEWER: And what are you left with? 

SUBJECT 1: Mhm? 

INTERVIEWER: What are you left with? You mentioned there are dreams? 

SUBJECT 1: Yeah. Sometimes I have dreams the Gestapo came in, they picked us up, and I-- 

SUBJECT 3: He screamed so, that I have to wake him up. I said, what happened? He says, I dreamt terrible things. 

SUBJECT 1: They beat me, and all kinds of this. And this, I have-- especially lately, I don't know. I mean, uh, very often I get these dreams. Terrible dreams. With everything what-- what went through this. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you ever dream of a child, of a little son? 

SUBJECT 1: No, I dream that-- only I dreamt once about-- in cloister how he was. And he was holding my pants. He said, Daddy, Daddy, don't leave me. 

SUBJECT 3: Take me home. 

SUBJECT 1: Take me home. He was crying, and I was crying. This is the only time I dreamed about this. 

SUBJECT 3: Otherwise, he dreams much more from his family he lost. And what he went through. And so I have to wake him up. He scream. I say, what happened? He says, oh, I dreamt terrible things. 

SUBJECT 1: I had one brother. He was killed in France. He was on the Maginot Line. 

SUBJECT 3: And after the liberation we really wanted to go to Israel. But my father wrote to me, you went through so much. And if you go to Israel, you have to struggle too much. You'd better go to America. It's going to be easier life for you. 

INTERVIEWER: OK, thank you. 

SUBJECT 2: Thank you. Yeah.
