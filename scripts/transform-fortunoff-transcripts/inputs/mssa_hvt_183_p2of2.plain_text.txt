[BEEPING] SUBJECT: --was sort of young and a pretty face. I don't mean it in that way, but you could talk yourself out. So I figured-- and just being there, and every day bringing him his food, and for others-- but once we came to Auschwitz, I never saw them again. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: [SIGHS] Now we come to Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How-- you are still in the-- in the brick factory? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. They were taking transport. I don't know-- we-- I think we were the second or the third. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And uh, you know, the cattle car. 

INTERVIEWER 2: The second or third day, or the second-- 

SUBJECT: The transport. 

INTERVIEWER 2: OK. 

SUBJECT: You know, they started-- I-- and I am not sorry that-- I, I might have not survived, you know, and the outside world wasn't so inviting or promising. But, uh, I know the day that my parents were burned. 

INTERVIEWER 1: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember, boarding the train-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --together with all of them-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --your thoughts as a young woman? The trip, mostly not what happened, but your own experience, where-- 

SUBJECT: We-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Were you going? 

SUBJECT: We knowed-- I didn't know. I mean, nobody told me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: But when they take away your all papers-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: Yeah, your citizen paper, and your bir-- whatever you had, and all your money, and all your jewelry, you know that nothing-- but you don't want to believe it. Absolutely, you don't want believe it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: When we were passing, during the night, our town, and the mill was all in blast, all the lights were burning-- I have to know my father built that mill with his two hands. And he says, please, God, burn it down. It's standing even now. 

So, uh, he says, but don't worry. We will come back. But I don't think he believed it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

SUBJECT: And neither did I. And when you arrive in Auschwitz-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any idea where you were going? 

SUBJECT: Pardon me? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any? 

SUBJECT: No. We did not know where we were going. But we know they are taking us to a detention camp. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And you have to underst-- I don't know if you know the Czechoslovakia, the Carpathian. The army was already on the border. And we knew about it. So we figured would take a little more and the army will come in. In 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Russian. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Right. 

SUBJECT: From the Russian front. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: But we had our army, the Czech-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Czech liberation. 

SUBJECT: And most of them were Jewish boys, my age-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: So you-- 

SUBJECT: --and schoolmates. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were hoping that our-- 

SUBJECT: That they will break through and, uh, they will not take us. And if not the Russians, they would have. But you see, when they came to the compartment-- let's say from here-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: You know, this is the compartment. They came here. So they turned the whole army around this way and bypassed, and gave an open way for the Germans to take us out. But we didn't know that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So we figured, where would they take us? They will-- our army is-- I mean, we knew who was in that army. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Czechs and Jews. 

SUBJECT: That's right. When, ah-- I am jumping a little of myself-- and we came back from-- after the war. So then out to the cemetery there, there was about 10 schoolmates of mine, and from nearby towns, from the same town-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --boys who were fighting, with blood in their eyes, to get to us. But the Russian wanted Carpathian. It opened their way, the big mountains. And this way, it's all flat. And they still hold it. But, uh, when we get out from the carts, they started dividing men and women. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the arrival in Auschwitz? 

SUBJECT: Yes. It was during the night. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Tell us. Yeah. 

SUBJECT: And, ah, we were-- the crematorium was burning in full speed. We didn't know what it is. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So everybody had another idea of what that is, you know. It's this factory. 'Cause having a glass factory, the chimney is very tall. I don't know if you know that. So, and this looked like I said. So we were wondering what kind of factory is here. We didn't know that it's human flesh burning. 

But by the morning, my mother was very weak. She was only 59. But she was a very small frame. And my father was a giant. And, ah, she had a heart condition. So she says, I hope I see my rest of my children yet. 

So I started-- when I saw that they are dividing, so I said-- one of my youngest brothers was with us. And I said, you better take good care of father. And I still-- as they started pushing father-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Men and women separate-- 

SUBJECT: Separately. Yeah. I should have brought you the book. I had a-- 

So I kissed him. And he says to me, see that your mother has another cup of coffee. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: He was worried about her. But I couldn't. We had-- one of my sisters' youngest son-- he was five years old-- happened to be in our house. And we couldn't send him back to where my sister lived in [INAUDIBLE]. So, uh, he went with my mother. 

And, ah, my sister and I were between the living. When we were there about a day or two, I met somebody and he's told me that my sister's-- my two nieces are in this and this camp. I mean, in another barrack. 

And they were fortunate enough to smuggle th-- my sister and I-- to smuggle them out from there. And we survived together, the two girl. Not my sister. She-- and you will meet them here, both. They're coming, you know. 

They were tiny little girls. I started telling you that I used to sit down on the floor when we were bombed, and put the two heads and put my body over it. The older one, Serena, she used to scream. They call me [HUNGARIAN]-- Hungarian. 

[HUNGARIAN], I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. I said, you won't. And the other one was shaking. I was afraid she will bite her tongue, the little one. She was in November-- 21st is her birthday. She was 13. And a small, little-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: She was 13 at the time. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. And she didn't realize what's going on. And we were about four weeks in, uh, A lager. And then they started sending transport. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Still together, the-- with-- 

SUBJECT: The two girls-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: --two girls? 

SUBJECT: --my sister and I. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And mother? 

SUBJECT: No. The mother went with the small-- they had two brothers, two little brothers. So the-- my-- that sister was a single girl. She was two years old and her name was Pearl. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So we were two single girls. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Father was separated first and then-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. The fa-- men-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm. 

SUBJECT: --separate, women separate. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Women and children together, yeah? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Yeah. So then you come to Mengele. And he puts women who may-- especially if they had children-- to one side-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --and, like, my sister and my to the other side. And the same thing, they-- I think you walked a few-- then they divided father and m-- son. And my sister h-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you understand what was happening? 

SUBJECT: By that time, I did. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When mother was separated? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. But you just don't want it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did-- 

SUBJECT: But you-- you-- you have the feeling that this is it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT: Because there were people who were sick-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --people who-- who couldn't walk. And they were just kicking them, you know, alive. I mean, you just have to know what's going on. You might not be very clear in your head. But a child like she, she did not. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did-- Uh, you kissed your father. But, and mother, did you have a chance? 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: No. Because we were walking, yet I was holding onto my mother. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And? 

SUBJECT: Till we came to another couple of-- I don't know. Here there-- the one who divided us-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Selection. 

SUBJECT: --there was just a kapo, also, maybe, a Jew. And then you came to the selection-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --where Mengele was standing. And he would make this way. And, uh, I didn't, I didn't even look after my mother. We came to [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm 

SUBJECT: So everybody gets undressed. And there was burning. They took all the papers and pictures. I will show you. 

I have a picture of my brother and sister-in-law. I saw her-- I knew that she is there because the pictures were burning on the f-- on that heap. Ah, and we were standing to go in the zone. And I looked down and I says to my sister, look. And I had very-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: There was a picture of, uh-- 

SUBJECT: Of my sister among the children and-- and family pictures were burning there. So it was very clear. 

But they shaved everyone. And I had very thick hair. Not that long, but very thick. And they started shaving it with the machine. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And it was hurting badly. I screamed. So I got my first smack. 

So another girl-- there were Jewish girls who were doing that. So she started cutting with the scissors. So half of my head was shaved. And the other half was cut in-- you know, how you cut with a scissor. And, ah, when we came out, we didn't recognize each other. 

We were taken to a barrack, given some clothes. And like I said, my sister knew the blockova. They were somewhere together. And it just happened that she was a Slovak girl. And she says, if you want to survive with those two children, you have to do something. 

So my sister and I would carry big buckets of water, and washing the floors. And when it came to appel, sometimes you were staying hours. And it was in the spring. 

It was still cold there. And you had nothing what to so wear. So we used to take the two girls and put them on the top. You know, it was three layers, the beds. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And just when the German would come to count us, we schlepped them out, so they shouldn't stay outside. And we had a drink of water, because the pails, we always made sure that they are full of water. People were dying for a drink of water. 

Finally, that blockova says to my sister, listen. You probably will hate me to the rest of your life. But I will send you somewhere to work where there is a possibility you could take the two girls along. 

And we went out to Brzezinka. You've probably heard the word. This is where you arrive, arriving center. And we were working there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The arriving center for-- 

SUBJECT: For the inmates. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Inmates for Auschwitz? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT: That was the out and the in. So when a-- the transport would come, the men would pick up the bundles, bring them to us, and we would sort them. Clothes, coats, jewelry, what we will use, fur, whatever we were. 

And naturally, there-- we used to find food. People-- a piece of bread, or some onion, some noodles, rice. You know, whatever people thought they hold on, especially if they came from, ah, Polish ghettos. They were better equipped than the Hungarian. 

The Hungarian brought a lot of tachrichim, if you know what that is, along. And you wouldn't believe that even there, we were making fun of it. There was a Polish girl. Her name was Dorka. 

She used to put it on and lay down on the floor and the rest would cry over it, [NON-ENGLISH]. So you knew that you will go to the chimney, that nobody will be buried. So she was saying-- I don't know if you understand Jewish-- and we would roll and laugh. If I think today, I can't believe it. But it did happen. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You would-- you would joke of people coming to be buried in the proper-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Tachrichim 

INTERVIEWER 2: Tachrichim 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Yeah. We were laughing. [SIGHS] So we worked there from late May till January the 18, when the whole thing was liquidated. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How-- do you remember that? 

SUBJECT: Oh, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Remember that day? What was that day like for you? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Transports kep-- kept coming all the time until-- 

SUBJECT: Till-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: --the very end? 

SUBJECT: Uh, no. Because they bombed the Jews decided-- the one who worked under Sonderkommando-- they deci-- they knew that those men used to be taken every-- I don't know how often. I can't recall-- replaced. And they said that they'd take them to another camp and they didn't. They used to kill them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Sonderkommando would be killed. 

SUBJECT: The Sonderkommando. It happened to be people-- from our town was a boy there. My brother-in-law was there, the father of those two children. he was shot because he had to burn his own wife and their children. So he just went berserk. And he was shot. 

The girls didn't know it. But the other man told my sister and myself. So they said that they are not going. They want to die here. 

And they bombed the crematorium. It was a Saturday afternoon. And suddenly they were start to march. And they were starting to sing, I think [HEBREW] or one-- one of those Hebrew prayers. 

And one crematorium blew and the other crema-- so, we were in the middle. So they started rounding us up. And we were all standing with our hands under-- this is the women. 

And the men started running. Because they started machine gunning them. And they-- they killed them all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You-- you witnessed that? 

SUBJECT: Yes. We witnessed. We all witnessed it. I mean, whoever was there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You remember the-- seeing the crematorium come-- going up? 

SUBJECT: Well, just-- yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you saw the Sonderkommando-- 

SUBJECT: Running. And they were-- because there was this place, let's say here was one crematorium, the other crematorium, and here in the middle, we were. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So, uh, and there was another gate after that. And they were taking them to that gate. And suddenly I-- we knew that something is going to happen. Because the man spoke about it, that they are not going. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hmm. 

SUBJECT: One man ran into our barrack and he was schlepped out and killed. I mean, I didn't see all them killed because we were inside and they-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --chased us to the barrack and we were standing with our-- but they did not harm the women. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But the thing that you s-- what did you see? Or hear? 

SUBJECT: I just see a blew. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Of the-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --crematorium going up. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did th-- did you think at that moment? Do you remember? 

SUBJECT: I was sure that they will kill us. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You were frightened. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. I-- I don't know if we were really frightened. It-- the things were happening so fast that we did not have time to think. We were shaking, for-- course. And knowing the people-- another lady had her brother there. And you know, after that-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any feeling about the Sonderkommando that did it-- how did you, at that moment, think of them? 

SUBJECT: I thought of them very courageous. They had nothing what to lose. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: That's true. And, ah, after that, there was no more, uh, crematorium there. No more, uh, transports were coming there. We were just finishing up whatever we had there. And, um, they took that crematorium apart. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Hmm. That was in what month and-- do you remember? 

SUBJECT: That was already-- I really-- I think November. 

INTERVIEWER 1: November, 1944. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: I think it-- it was November. The Germans who were-- the Oberscharfuhrer and all those-- I think they did not want to go away. They were also waiting that the war should get over. So we were packing and repacking the-- those things, the clothes. But finally, we did leave Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And do you remember that day? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. We were bombed all night. In the morning, we saw that they were running and coming, you know. And there was always somebody who-- who knew what was going on and it was going from one to another. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So.. 

SUBJECT: So we were preparing ourself. Everybody saw that they has a good pair of shoes. I mean, because the clothes was there. One of my cousins worked by the clothes-- by the shoes. 

So, uh, we each had, you know, a pair of slacks and a sweater and a jacket. And, um, by the afternoon, they rounded us up and we started walking out. If they would have left us there, I don't know how many days later we would have been liberated. 

My younger brother he hid in the kitchen. And he was liberated there. But as they schlepped-- I don't know if you heard about the march. People were falling from all sides. It-- I-- I don't know how many survived and how many made it. 

My sister got cramps in her stomach. And she couldn't walk. So we practically schlepped her. 

And there was a girl-- she was here last week-- Ebie Friedman. You weren't here. 

She-- you know, you had to count-- they were counting, always, by five. So there was the two nieces, my sister, and myself. And we adopted, the-- sort of, like, this girl, to us. 

She has flat feet and she never-- couldn't walk. And she sat down and she said she's not going. She's just not going. 

And I got so furious. I said, I am going to kill you, not the German. And I started hitting her. 

And she got up. She says, I was afraid you really will kill me. And-- so I already had two to schlep. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why were you so furious at her? 

SUBJECT: I don't know. All my fury-- I said the German is not going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Because if you sat down-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --they shot you. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm. 

SUBJECT: By the time we arrived to Ravensbruck, I had already fever. And, um, I really didn't-- there were days I just didn't know what's day and what night. 

And from there, they schlepped us yet further, to Neustadt-Glewe. And I got to the hospital, Soldau hospital. By the time I got better-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: How did you manage that? How-- how did you-- 

SUBJECT: I was lying and-- ah, you know. And they would come-- they put us-- this was a munition f-- not a munition, an airplane factory. And they were barracks. 

So they pushed us on, too many in a room, that you couldn't even sit down. There wasn't that much. They said lagst dieher unter, so you just sat own, and where-- whoever was underneath you-- so I was naturally underneath. Because I couldn't. 

So-- those things are not clear to me at all. I don't remember going to the hospital. I do remember being there. But also, like, in-- I don't know what day my sister was taken with typhoid and I never heard from her. When I came out, I did not know that she was sick. 

The two girls were the strong ones. And didn't take too many weeks that the war was over. We were not liberated by anybody. 

The Germans just left. And the people who could walk walked out of the-- that place, to this town. And, ah, the town people make believe that it's a big surprise to them. 

By that time, I was already very swollen legs. I couldn't walk. And we stayed in an empty apartment. But we were bothered by the-- meanwhile, the Russian took that part. And the Russian soldiers were bothering us terribly. So there was some Czech men who were in Zwangsarbeit-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Forced labor. 

SUBJECT: Forced labor. And I don't know from where they come. So they put out the Czech flag. And-- and they were standing practically and watching us. And any Russian soldier just came near us-- 

Finally, I heard that they are coming to check people. Not the government. I mean, I don't if the government did. But that particular-- any vehicle-- if it was a truck, a car, a bus, a taxi-- they came and picked us up, deep to Germany. 

And we were fortunate to get on one of those vehicles and we arrived to the border the day when they brought in from Lidice-- if you heard, Lidice was a village where they killed all the men and boys over 14 and took the women and children to camp. And that was the day they brought them back. We came a whole caravan. 

They were wonderful, the Czech people. Like children who come home. They would the last piece of bread, they-- they didn't have much, either. Came to Prague. 

We were taken to Prague, to hospitals. I saw that-- my whole thing was just to bring those two children home. And, um, so I started walking the streets to find somebody that I could tak so. 

So I met a second, third cousin. And she says, you know, your brother Joseph is here. I told you that he escaped Palestine. But we were not sure that he's alive. 

Because I had a schoolmate. His name was also Joseph Meulensteen. And he fell [NON-ENGLISH]. And the news came that my brother-- my parents never knew-- but the rest of the family were told that he's not alive. But it turned out that was my schoolmate and not my brother. 

And he kept then-- he was stationed in Plzen. And that was also the dividing line between the Russian army and the American. So he didn't have such an access. 

So I said, how can I-- there is no mail, no telephone. How can I get to him? She says-- she says, if you find a soldier with a red beret, this is his unit. 

First soldier I meet in the street, I said to him, listen. Could you tell me if you knew B-- uh Joseph Normastein? He says, yes. We are in the same unit. 

I said, please tell him that his sister is here. He says, he wouldn't believe me if I swear on 10 bibles. Because he had so many false leads. 

So I s-- I said, do you have a piece of paper? He gave me a piece of paper. And as he-- he was standing, on his back, I wrote, I'm here with the two children who need you desperately. 

That night, he broke the barrier, took a motorcycle, and he was there 1 o'clock in the night, in the hospital. We were in very bad shape. We had-- how do you call? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Kritz. 

SUBJECT: Yes. And I-- and he took us-- he rented a house-- not a house, a room, really-- there where he was. And he took us there. 

And the kitchen, the military kitchen, fed us. Had a cousin there who was a pharmacist. He gave some B vitamins and some iron. Because the doctor said if he doesn't want us-- if he doesn't want to bury us by the fall, he better do something fast. 

INTERVIEWER 1: [SIGHS] 

SUBJECT: And finally, I had to be hospitalized. I was in the hospital till middle of October. And the doctor says I could go home. But I had nowhere to go. Home was so far away. 

And he was still in the military. He-- he was applying for discharge. But those things don't go fast. 

Finally-- this is the reason Israel-- went home, didn't find anything and anybody, her husband, her children, home. So that was about 500 kilometer. You-- people were traveling on top of the cattle carts. 

And she came. I, uh, stayed there till they didn't rent an apartment. And then we stayed together till we came to this country. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Let me ask you a-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: To it's-- obviously, you were together. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How-- what was that-- how did you-- uh, it was, on one hand, responsibility. On the other hand, it was-- what did it do for you to be together? 

SUBJECT: Oh, I-- I had for whom to fight, see. After I-- look, I knew my sister is not alive. And their mother is not alive. So my whole thing was just to bring them. When I sort of gave over to my brother, and finally, my sister, I did not want to live. Not that I would have committed suicide. Because I'm too orthodox for that. 

But I used to quarrel with my father. Like, he would be sitting there, and I used to say, father-- he used to say that every creature comes for something on this world. That was he was preaching to us. 

So I said, is this why you came to the world? I used to see the trucks turn over children and burn them. What did those children do? 

Or I was at our barracks. We worked, for quite a while, during the night. And during the day, we used to sleep. 

So I was afraid to look to the window, because that's where the transports used to go there, if I will see somebody from mine, what am I going to do? Till one day, somebody shakes me during the sleeping hours. And he says, there is transport from choss. I think your sister is with them. 

I jumped out of the thing, and I did not say anything to the children and to my sister. And I went running straight to the-- I didn't care if anybody sees me, or-- and I look. And there is my sister. 

I didn't run there. I run back to the hauptscharfuhrer, and I said, please, hauptscharfuhrer, my s-- my shvester is here. He says, go. 

Took off my shoes. I took off my kerchief from my head. Whatever bread I had, I started mobili-- I ran back, ran forth. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: People thought that I'm crazy. But she was going on a transport. And she didn't have her children there, already her husband-- so I know that she was alive. 

I was concerned because most women with small children went to the crematorium. But her mother-in-law was with her. So they sort of divided her mother-in-law with her two children. The third was with my-- my mother. So I knew that she was alive. 

But when it came after the war, somehow-- I didn't have my health anymore. I didn't have a home. I didn't have the-- one-- one whom I thought he will surely be. He was strong and young. The first practical person whom I met in Prague told me that he's dead. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was that? 

SUBJECT: That-- like I said, I was involved with somebody. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And we were supposed to get married. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A friend. Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So I knew that I don't have a mother and father. But I was counting on him. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And I just didn't want-- that my younger niece would sit by my bed and cry. We need you. 

I said, you don't need me anymore. [INAUDIBLE] crying she will-- they will take care of you. But I guess, if you have to live, you live. It took me years-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --till I decided that I must-- if God wanted me to live for some reason. So let me see what that reason. It's not that I should work in a factory, I'm sure, or I should eat. 

So then I met my husband. And we decided to get married. And God was good to me, gave me two very beautiful children. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. Did the sister that you met live, or-- 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Yeah. She isn't-- she the oldest of us. Yes. She remarried. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: Yes. And now she lives in Israel 

INTERVIEWER 1: Does she? 

SUBJECT: Yes? 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you were in the K-- was it the Kanada uh, Kommando that you were in? The one that-- 

SUBJECT: I'm-- was not in-- only men were in the Sonderkommando. I was in-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: No. I'm asking about-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Kanada. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --Kanada. 

SUBJECT: No. 

INTERVIEWER 1: It wasn't called the Kanada corner? I mean, those who took over the-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: It-- it was a-- like a nickname, uh, for that group of people that sorted things. 

SUBJECT: Oh, that was, uh-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: It was called Kanada, no? 

SUBJECT: Yeah. Yeah. You see, I-- I-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was that the Komm-- 

SUBJECT: Yes. There was the red kerchiefs, and white kerchiefs. Some of them worked during the day. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. Some of them worked during the night. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But was it the Kanada-- called-- 

SUBJECT: That's right. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --the Kanada Kommando? 

SUBJECT: We had every day a shower. I mean-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah. 

SUBJECT: It was something. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you-- and you watched things going on. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Any thoughts from being, uh, somebody who sees everything? 

SUBJECT: Uh-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now? At that time? 

SUBJECT: That-- oh, we-- it was very clear to us-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: I mean, this Irene niece, she used to say, Roshe, what do do you see what I don't see? 

INTERVIEWER 1: She what? 

SUBJECT: She used to ask me what do I see what she doesn't see. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yes. 

SUBJECT: Because the first couple of days, I was hitting, practically, my head in the wall when I saw what's going on. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

SUBJECT: So, uh, but finally, she-- she realized. And, ah, she suffered. She was so scared. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: I used to go out and cook. I don't know if anybody described-- there was the latrines. And there was a girl who had to wash-- they are very clean, those Germans. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: And that, uh, the garbage was also piled up there. And that poor girl used to be beaten up. Because people would come and throw things, you know. And she used to be punished for that. 

So one day, she was crying. I said, Dorka, what are you crying? She says, look what people do. So, come, I said. I help you. So she says, for that-- she was allowed to cook. 

What was there to cook? We found some beans or rice. So we used to take candles, cut the candles in pieces, and wrap it in a piece of cloth, and light it-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Hmm. 

SUBJECT: --in a pail. And on that, we used to put the-- whatever cooking. And, ah, she says, for that, you could come here and you could cook. 

So she says, excuse me, I'm the latrine. But meanwhile, they were [INAUDIBLE] if they caught me going there and coming. And once I was there, nobody bothered-- so by the time I used to come back, she couldn't eat. She had stomach aches 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your niece. 

SUBJECT: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So that helped us, that we were not so malnutritioned. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: Sometimes, if we have found noodles, you know, and if I couldn't go out to-- we used to cook it in the barracks. And if the German was coming, we'd take a bundle of clothes and put on and sit on it. And he would [SNIFFING] smell like a dog, but he-- somehow, he didn't realize-- well, that wasn't once or twice-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: --that we are cooking. Like I said, I was fighting. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: I had obligation. Like, I would stand-- there was the vorarbeiter. And she used to say, I don't see anything. I don't hear anything. 

So nights, winter nights, I used to bundle those two girls up and hide them in a corner and work for them, too, with my sister, or stand outside and watch that the Germans shouldn't come. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Mm-hmm. 

SUBJECT: So by the time I reached home, I had no desire to live. 

INTERVIEWER 2: OK. Thank you very much. [SIGHS] 

SUBJECT: Did I over-- oh. Too much. I talk too much. 

INTERVIEWER 2: No. Not at all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Not at all 

SUBJECT: [SIGHS] We are here. I hope so-- yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Let me help you with this, yes? 

SUBJECT: Oh. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Thank you. 

SUBJECT: Toda raba. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Thank you. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who, uh, just came off from somewhere. 

CREW: Siyamt? 

CREW: No. 

CREW: But if you're gonna fit it on Boris, leave it on Boris-- 

CREW: Yeah. 

CREW: --until you're done with it. 

CREW: I know. [INAUDIBLE] 

CREW: Because you keep puttin' it on, takin' it off--
