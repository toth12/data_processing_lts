HELEN S.: Ah, the uncle's house, yeah. This was Hadassah when-- with the-- I think, Elie Wiesel when-- I remember when I lost my husband. Eli Wiesel wrote me a letter. He says, I'm heartbroken, because he knew my husband. 

INTERVIEWER 2: It's underneath there. That's it. 

CREW: It's the very first one. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did he know your husband, Mr. Wiesel? 

HELEN S.: I will tell you this-- this story I will tell you, how he knew my husband. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Now, that's-- 

HELEN S.: It is-- I'm glad you ask me because I don't want to talk too much, but you're asking me. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That's all right. 

HELEN S.: That's all? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Is that enough? Almost. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Thank you. 

HELEN S.: When my cousin passed away, he wasn't sick. And he was-- you know how precious-- anyways, this was on, um, um, a day before being Yom Kippur was the funeral. And Yom Kippur was in my cousin's house, in Hadassah's house. 

And Elie Wiesel liked my cousin very much too. He [INAUDIBLE] Yom Kippur over there, saying the prayers. And my husband was a brilliant mind and a very fine man. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did your husband do? 

HELEN S.: Before the war, he was, uh, um, a manager in a factory from bricks. And in the war, he was working in Flossenburg. He was liberated in Dachau. But anyways, when we were there, they were praying. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When he was in-- when he was in Gleiwitz with you? 

HELEN S.: He was in Gleiwitz later. He was in Dachau, in Flossenburg, in Oranienburg, all over. And, uh, when they were praying for the whole Yom Kippur in my cousin's house, in my c-- Elie Wiesel made the prayers, and my husband said the prayers. And Elie Wiesel said to my husband, let's talk. 

My husband said, I am a rabbi's son. And Elie Wiesel said, this what you don't have to tell me because he knew. My husband went for checkups. He couldn't go. He was sick. He had a heart attack when we went-- came back from Israel the second time. [INAUDIBLE] 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did your husband do in this country? 

HELEN S.: In this country, oh, I-- we bought a house next to the Jewish home. It's nice. It's-- I'm glad you asked me. And I was there. 

When I went there to work, a man came and asked me, could you come into work? And I came in. I said-- [INAUDIBLE] I saw German misery. But I said, I will never quit this job. 

There was one man. His name was Mr. [? Sugarman, ?] a blind one. My husband used to go to the syn-- the synagogue to pray with him. He one day said to him, couldn't you bring in your husband to work for us? And I went to my husband. 

And I says, listen, we don't need any [? diamonds ?] in any [? force, ?] because I remember in my family, all the [? force ?] what you see, I saw it in my family. I said, let's go work for them, father. And my husband was there for years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Doing what? 

HELEN S.: Doing-- he was the assistant to the manager. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. What was his training? What had he-- 

HELEN S.: My husband had this training for a home. But you have to be born, and you cannot pick it up in college. He had the heart and the love for our mother and our father. And to this day, whoever is alive still, whenever they see me, they are crying. And I promised I will never quit this job. And I-- was Mr. Greenberg related to you? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes. 

HELEN S.: This was the man [LAUGHS] who tried to give me money. I was working. Then I know your mother. And I didn't want to take any money. 

I said-- he says-- I says, this is the way I brought up, was brought up. And he says, they brought them up the other way. I says, Mr. Greenberg, you are reminding me anyways of my uncles. Because he was very clever, and my uncles, they were very clever. 

But I knew your mother too, and I'm very friendly with Ann Jacobson. I didn't see her for a long time. I love them. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your husband? 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And where you met him, where he was born. 

HELEN S.: He was born in [? Siemiatycze, ?] not far from Bendzin. And in our town, we'd have met, but I came from a very religious home. And they-- and my-- my daughter is a social worker. Says, Mother, what you are doing to this old-- [LAUGHS] [? things. ?] 

I am-- I said, Susan, I am just telling you facts. I-- my husband was a rabbi's son. And I was a rabbi's, uh, other rabbi's granddaughter. And there was a matchmaker. I was in school, and I wouldn't want to look. 

But later, we were got married through a matchmaker. And whenever my daughter says, did you ask the father? I says, no, my father said the same thing. We were from the same background. And I used to tell you, d-- my daughter, Susan, I never met a human being like your father, never. And, uh, Mr. [? Cooper ?] knows him, because they were in the same town. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you were married-- 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --just before the war. 

HELEN S.: Just in-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Or during the war. 

HELEN S.: No, just in-- on the beginning of the war in my-- my-- sis-- my old-- one of my sisters were married to our cousin. And she had the most brilliant children. I remember the child who skipped a grade. And when she was reading Gone with the Wind, she was maybe seven years old. And my sister says, she's-- she puts on-- she-- my sister didn't-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: She was reading Gone with the Wind [? there? ?] 

HELEN S.: Yeah, but in Polish, maybe seven years. And my sister doesn't-- thought that she's just looking through the book, when she started to talk about the book. But she's just like-- like Scarlett, and he's like this. See? 

And one-- one of her sons, when he went to school, given to [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] and later, they have a school. This was a [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] first Hebrew, and afternoon, they went to school. And he had a very bad handwriting. 

When the-- visit-- visitor came to the school, the teacher told my sister. And he saw his handwriting. He took-- he said to my sister, your son saved my life. He was the smartest kid, and he took him to [INAUDIBLE]. And so [? every ?] and this kid who had such a handwriting. He's so smart. My chil-- she was married to our cousin. 

They said if you are married to a relative, the children are not normal. They were so normal. Another cousin was married-- married to my one brother. And the oldest brother was married to a cousin. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did all these people live near each other? 

HELEN S.: Yeah, it was all-- yeah. We brought-- [INAUDIBLE] I don't know why. But I-- nobody was good enough for them. I don't know why. Maybe I wanted [INAUDIBLE] a little. I don't know why. 

That's-- but I know only that the children were out-- outstanding. I don't have the picture from this, from my brother's kid, who came, and he was maybe four years old in the ghetto. And my sister-in-law didn't find the kid. They-- they-- she thought that they took him already. 

They found him underneath of a trash bag box. He was in-- why you're here? I'm hiding from the, uh, from the gestapo. And he had, uh, uh, laid there, 104 fever. He said to the mother, Mama, let's go back to the ghetto, to the town. The SS wouldn't find us because they know that all the Jews are now in the ghetto. He was maybe four or five years old. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did any of them survive? 

HELEN S.: No, no, nobody. We were 63 from the nearest family. And we were 11 who survived. And from my father's family, no. It was only one cousin. She went to Russia. 

And she came back to Poland, but she was afraid to say that she's a Jew. She was-- they sent in Irish papers with her husband and two children. But when she found out they is-- can go to Israel, she talked it over to-- to our friend. She told her, children are asleep. 

In the morning, the child ask her mama, are we Jews? She says, yes, we are, but we have to keep it a secret. And whenever they had a chance, she had a sister. She survived in Switzerland. 

She took her out. And the rest vanished-- children, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, cousins. Nobody is alive. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What about your husband's family? Do know anything what about them? 

HELEN S.: Everybody. The only-- one niece survived. And she came to [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] in the ar-- Armia [? Kryova, ?] the I-- they called themselves AK. They killed her after the war. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What did that stand for, AK? 

HELEN S.: Armia [? Kryova, ?] it's the-- er, the patriots, let's say. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The patriots killed her after the war. 

HELEN S.: Sure, they killed them [INAUDIBLE] a girl. The Ukrainian killed a girl on [INAUDIBLE] too. That's why one of-- she writes to me. We wrote-- we got together. We were eight orphans, and we got together like sisters. 

See? And she was, um, Irish papers too, because she was afraid they were going to kill her too. That's not fairy tales. This is statements. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When you-- when you and your husband first were married, it was during the war. 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Wasn't it hard to get married then? 

HELEN S.: Oh, yeah. We went to the rabbi's, uh, house. And all my girlfriends, they were not Jewish. They were at the reception, and then they only just wonder what song. And this was a dear friend, but she said she couldn't do anything. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Weren't they were afraid to come to be with Jewish-- 

HELEN S.: No, this-- by this time, this was in the beginning when we weren't in the ghetto yet, and thus they came to the wedding. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What-- what month were you married? 

HELEN S.: January the 20th. In March, they took him away. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But the Germans had come in September, so-- 

HELEN S.: No, that's what-- I don't know what [? the problem ?] must be. They came in 1939. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you were married-- 

HELEN S.: '40, the '40. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In 1940, but the Germans hadn't come to your town yet. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, sure, they weren't [? there. ?] They were all over. And I think they-- if you read the book from Singer, how he writes about-- he goes in, in, uh, why he left Poland. 

When he went in the beginning of the war, he went into the-- this was on Yom Kippur, and he went into their room to the hair-- hair-- for a haircut. This Polack didn't know that's a Jew [INAUDIBLE], erev Yom Kippur. He told him, isn't it nice that the Nazis are here? Those bed bugs, he will take care. 

They didn't care about them. They, as long-- I don't know what it was. It may be because they were raised this way. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mrs. [? Sander, ?] I-- I don't want to press you, but-- 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But I don't understand something. 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The Germans came in September of 1939. 

HELEN S.: '39. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were married in January of 1940. 

HELEN S.: '40, yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And you said-- 

HELEN S.: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --that some non-Jewish friends of yours-- 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --came to the reception. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, they were. They were. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Now, weren't-- if the Germans were already there-- 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Weren't they afraid to come? 

HELEN S.: No, probably not. In-- in the beginning, they weren't so afraid. But later, I remember at night once, the Polacks, they [? could ?] go out. The Jews, they had to stay home. 

And this [? Wanda ?] came to visit. Then she went out from the house. He ask her, probably, if she's a Jew. I never talked it over with her, because I [? saw the name. ?] And I think she told him, I am visiting a friend. 

I remember the way they had on the front of our house two men. Then I-- oh, and the-- but I was living after. It was, um, a boy, and he was-- the other was [? Herschel. ?] The boy's name I don't remember. I remember they hanged him on the front of the mother's house. 

INTERVIEWER 1: They hung them in front-- 

HELEN S.: Yeah, in front of-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: --of the mother. 

HELEN S.: --the mother's house. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When was that? 

HELEN S.: This was in 1939, or probably 1940. Must be between January and March, that's what I remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe the night they came in to, or the day they came and took your husband? What happened? 

HELEN S.: Oh, oh, I remember they knocked on the door. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were living with me who? 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Just the two of you? 

HELEN S.: Yeah, no, we were living like, uh, a boarder. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You were living like boarders in a house. 

HELEN S.: Yeah. Then the other name was [INAUDIBLE], anyways, [INAUDIBLE], I think. Anyways, they came in, and they took my husband. I begged them. I kneeled. I did-- didn't help. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe it from the beginning? Was it at night? 

HELEN S.: No, this was in the middle of the night. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In the middle of the night, were you asleep? 

HELEN S.: Sure, sure. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And what do you-- 

HELEN S.: You can not say no or something like that. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you remember? Can you describe it exactly as you remember it, what you heard, what you saw? 

HELEN S.: Nothing I heard. I heard the marching, the marching, and just that's what. Later in the day, I ran crying. Never saw him again. Only when they-- when they took me a short time later. 

It's hard to believe, right? They said to me-- and I don't cry. I never cry. Do you know what I found out about myself from the books? 

My-- I never-- we never tell the children. And you think, my [INAUDIBLE] daughter buys the books, and she brings them home. And when I wrote-- read the survivors, I found out I never-- we never cried. I never saw a tear. We never cried in the concentration camps. 

I don't know why. I don't remember tears in anybody's eyes. We were so frightened. I don't know what is-- hungering, cold. And I think that's why I am so-- it's only because I never-- I-- I said to Hadassah, because I may be dumb. 

She says, no, that's not so. I didn't think. I just was only-- this is my nature. When they broke into my house, I came. I didn't see what they took. 

I says, oh, my, they could took this. They can take this. But how lucky I am. They didn't take everything. When I was in concentration camp, I says, I hope everybody's dead, and I have to die. That's all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said nobody cried. But you also-- 

HELEN S.: I didn't see crying. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But you also said people were screaming. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, but we-- they weren't scream. I don't know, talking loud. I don't know remember what was it, but I don't remember a tear in an eye. What was it? I don't remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What people-- you said you didn't think. 

HELEN S.: I don't. I didn't think of anything. Oh, oh, oh, I just remember. When I said to my husband, let's commit suicide. Then they said they brought-- then they collecting people for Auschwitz, for the gas chamber. They said they brought one of my brother-in-laws. They brought him from some concentration camp. And they wanted him. And I said, this is enough. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where-- how did you see your husband at that point? 

HELEN S.: I-- it was sometimes was a gate, and sometimes I saw my husband. 

INTERVIEWER 1: In Gleiwitz? 

HELEN S.: Yeah, yeah. On the [? baustelle ?] once, I remember I had-- I-- somebody gave me a dress. And I gave it to the Polack. This gentleman gave me a dress. Peter was his name. 

He said, you never ask me for anything. Take a dress. He gave me a scarf. And I gave it to the Polack, and the Polack brought bread. 

I took two slices of bread, and I dropped it. My bro-- my husband was working on the [? baustelle. ?] But they-- I don't know how to call this, oh, making roads or whatever they did. 

INTERVIEWER 1: He was working with a wheelbarrow. Is that what you mean? 

HELEN S.: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I dropped this, uh, bread. And I was working outside too. And he says, [? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], ?] he told me. And up-- over there was a-- a-- SS. He saw me dropping the bread. 

And it's a good thing my husband saw-- saw the SS. I picked up the bread, and I went to the SS. And I said, see what a nice man this is? I dropped my [INAUDIBLE] and he told me, that's what. 

One day, we were working in a garden. And I brought-- in Gleiwitz. We were working across a-- an orchard. They were apples and pears. And some children, they got-- I forgot to say that I had 100 [INAUDIBLE]-- 100 mark. 

I found [? them ?] in [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] I found an-- a piece of paper that was 100 marks. That's when I went with this to the Gleiwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you find it? 

HELEN S.: When they took me Gleiwitz, on the floor in the [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] somebody dropped it, maybe by chance. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What is the [? [NON-ENGLISH]? ?] 

HELEN S.: It's when they take you, they put you in this, uh, [INAUDIBLE] place. And they get orders from companies. That's what. And then I came to the city, Gleiwitz, I could buy apples. [INAUDIBLE] one girl went. When we saw nobody's around, we put in the money. We get brought the apples. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How were you able to hide the 100 mark note? 

HELEN S.: I had them always in the-- I don't remember. Probably I hide them. A piece of paper you can hide. They were looking for money. They never found it. And-- and I was lucky maybe. I don't know why. She never looked in mine. How I found it-- but anyways, we had these apples. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who's "she never looked?" 

HELEN S.: This was the officer there. Officer, no, she was a [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] And before, we went-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was she a German guard? 

HELEN S.: Sure, German, only German. 

INTERVIEWER 1: A German guard in his place. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, yeah. And-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Do remember her? 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you desc-- 

HELEN S.: Her name was [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe her? 

HELEN S.: Oh, she was, uh, she came-- I don't know how to-- she didn't have a chance to-- to-- to harm somebody. I know that's, um, when somebody told her, that's why we had these apples. Somebody told her we had apples. Everybody ate the apples up. And I took this apple for my husband home. 

And I put them in the straw. You know, we were-- because I know that on the top of them, they're lazy, the Germans. They wouldn't look in straw. Sure enough, at night, she calls everybody out. She says that somebody told her that we bought apples. 

And I don't know why she never was mean to me. Because when she was looking for money, she never looked at my place. And I had $100. I remember me going out. And he says, Frau, [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] when they told you about fruit, I think they were mistaken. 

Because we never-- I am working in this com-- colo-- colony what they call this. And I never saw fruit. And I was the only one who had the apple. And she said, when you are telling me, I believe it. 

Yeah, you couldn't survive on this food what they gave us. In Ravensbruck, I don't know who survive. I know only them. I don't know they have, uh, um, uh, come-- uh, gas chamber in Ravensbruck, because-- but I remember there were loads. Like you collect garbage, they were collecting dead people, for loads of people. I don't know what they did with them. It's hard to believe and hard to describe. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you describe this guard who asked you about the apple? 

HELEN S.: Um, I-- this was a la-- a woman. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you-- what did she look like? 

HELEN S.: Just normal like anybody else. I remember she had a-- had face this. And later, they let her go, because she wasn't-- she wasn't-- when they made the concentration camp, no, she was-- no, she wasn't there. She-- I don't remember if she was there. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did she wear a uniform? 

HELEN S.: No, no, they-- they called them the [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] civil. She didn't wear the uniform. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you know anything about her, where she came from? 

HELEN S.: No, never knew her. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Never knew. Was there any guard ever that you could talk to or find out about? Never. 

HELEN S.: No, no. One was, uh, beat you up a lot, and the other beat you up a little. But they all had one in common. They were no good. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How old were they generally? I mean, were-- 

HELEN S.: Oh, they were not old. They were-- I was thinking they were 30, the most [? 35. ?] Very seldom was an old man. This-- this [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] was fat. He looked to me like 40. And this, uh, baker, but we called him [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] looked about 40 too. 

I think he was-- um, the most of them, they were alcoholics maybe too. i don't know. I was afraid of them to look at them. And, uh, I remember when they used to come in at night and take out the girls, you know. It was hard. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What do you mean they came in? 

HELEN S.: One night, they came in. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who's they, the guards? 

HELEN S.: They did-- no, the-- the big shots. The guard was-- there-- there was the [? be, ?] their [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] I don't remember what his name was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yeah. 

HELEN S.: And the [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] and I-- I don't-- I-- I-- when I came home from war, I fell asleep hungry. But I never woke up four days. And the girl who was sleeping next to me woke me up. When I saw them, I remember I start to laugh. I don't know why. It was maybe he's staring or something. And she pinched me so much that I was-- I quiet down. I don't know what-- what they did to the girls. I don't remember it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What happened? Now, they came in at night, and they-- 

HELEN S.: At night, they took them out. Then they came back. The girls came back. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did they tell you where they were? 

HELEN S.: No, they-- you never asked it. In a concentration camp, we don't talk. We don't ask. We're just like-- let's say, a horse. You go and come back. And you work until you die or they kill you. This was a concentration camp. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why do you think they never took you out? 

HELEN S.: I don't know. They took-- probably I wasn't so pretty like the other girls. They wanted show business. They wanted pretty girls. You can never describe them. Even when I am talking here, I don't want it-- I don't talk only for our history. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When-- 

HELEN S.: That's all. I don't-- I'm not concerned about anybody, or they would be better-- they were-- I-- I remember in [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] I was laying there and couldn't eat anymore. And they gave us [? honey, ?] a piece of honey. That's what they said, honey. 

That was a solid piece. And next to me was a girl. She wasn't-- she hadn't got dark hair. I says, Rose, take it. 

She says, Helen, I am a Gypsy, and you are a Jew. When the war will be over, you don't tell anybody that you are a Jew. And I wouldn't be tell anybody-- I can never forget her-- that I am a Gypsy, because whenever they will have a chance, they will do it again. 

This was Rose. She was from Berlin. And I remember, she said, [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] She was-- they had a store or something like that. I remember her voice. I'll never forget it. 

That's what she said to me. If we will survive-- because no-- none of us. They-- and on the way to Gross-Rosen, I asked my husband's friend, Mr. [? Cooper, ?] can you tell him something about Gross-Rosen? I didn't know what this is. He said, yes, whoever went into Gross-Rosen never went out alive. This was the final station where they were taking us. We all were sentenced to death. It was only a matter of time. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I want to ask you a little bit more about the girls that they took out. Were their heads shaved? 

HELEN S.: No, no, they-- they didn't head shave our-- our Gleiwitz. This was everything in Gleiwitz. No, they were pretty girls, nice kids. Mhm. I remember this story too, when this [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] asked our colony to undress. And he went-- this was-- it was the-- if we had the showers, and he was our-- I was, um, asked, um, where, before the showers, there was, uh, a room, a [INAUDIBLE]. Anyways, the children started to cry. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Children? How old? 

HELEN S.: Children, I-- well, 16 years. I call them all children. They were crying. And it's-- when he says undress, it's undress or a bullet. I remember I said to the girls, girls, why you are crying? Were you ever ashamed to undress them in front of a dog? 

I went the first one, undressed myself, and went in. And he said, how old are you? I says-- I don't know how old I was, 25, 27? He says, fine, go, and next. He called in the next girls. 

I don't know what to do. [? They-- ?] I didn't ask questions. I never asked anything. You don't ask. We don't talk. 

We are just like-- I don't know how to describe us. I'm not too much of a psychiatrist. I know only what I am doing today. I am certain I will be sent to in April, and I'm working full time all the years, and I'm glad to be with our mother. That's all. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You said that you didn't see any tears. 

HELEN S.: No, I didn't. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yet, but-- but you said these girls, these 16-year-old children-- 

HELEN S.: They cried. They were-- they were screaming. Helen-- [INAUDIBLE]. And they wouldn't-- they didn't want to go in. But you cannot play with the-- and say no to an SS. But he was only looking for to kill you. 

They didn't like when we were killing ourself. He says, he took an appeal. They called this a call role. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Roll call. 

HELEN S.: Roll call. He says, why you are killing yourself? Do you have any complaints? How about that? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who said that? 

HELEN S.: The [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Where were you when he said it? 

HELEN S.: The over-- everything in Gleiwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: But where were you? Were you standing someplace? 

HELEN S.: I [? was ?] in the roll call. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Roll-- explain it. Explain the roll. 

HELEN S.: When I was-- one girl, I hid, [? Bella ?] [? Long. ?] Then a young girl, maybe 15, 16, she killed herself in no time. She jumped out from the [? [NON-ENGLISH], ?] they called this. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The what? 

HELEN S.: Where they-- they were packing the-- the things for the ammunition. And another girl was standing next to me. Maybe she was a little older than I am. She told me about her father. She was living with her father. 

She says, do you think it's worthwhile to live? I said, sure, we have to hope. She says, I don't think so. And that's what she said. A minute late, maybe 15, and she went away. 15 minutes later, she was dead. She called-- throw herself out from the same place. 

INTERVIEWER 1: So now you were standing on line at the roll call. And-- and this man said about why do you kill yourself? 

HELEN S.: Yeah, later, when he found out one killed herself, the other-- and maybe he [? knew ?] this. He wasn't sorry about killed. They need to-- we were strong people. They need us. They needed us. 

They had orders for people, and they killed so many already probably. I don't know what was the reason. I know only that, uh, when he wanted to hang this girl, [? Lola ?] [? Lipschitz. ?] I think she's alive-- the SS went to this [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] He told him you cannot kill her. And you don't have [? first ?] [? yet ?] to report to the-- to the temp-- to the-- to the-- I don't know where they-- to Auschwitz, because we were a branch from Auschwitz. It's where they took the numbers, and we were a branch from Auschwitz. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When they asked the young girls to undress-- 

HELEN S.: Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: --what happened after they undressed? 

HELEN S.: I-- I-- I went-- I undressed myself, and I came and put back in the [? cupboard. ?] Now you go in. And I went away. I don't-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Why did they want you to undress? 

HELEN S.: I don't know why. I didn't ask questions, and I didn't ask the girls later. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Who was watching you get undressed? 

HELEN S.: He was only-- the only one that ever did. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Just one person was-- 

HELEN S.: One person. This was-- I think that his name was Baker. We called him [? mountain. ?] And, uh, and I went-- when I went out, fine, I never asked the girls what it was and how it was and where were-- nothing. We didn't ask anybody any questions. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When-- when you went out and got dressed again, where did you go? 

HELEN S.: I went back to my barrack, wherever I was, I don't-- It wasn't the thing. It's-- it's not-- everybody knew we were sentenced to death. That's what you don't think. You'd only think, but you are hungry. 

It's something like an animal sits in you and eats you, eats you day and night. The only dream, everything was on your mind, was bread, nothing else but bread. I remember in [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] we were laying there and cooking. You know, cooking in the imagination, cook-- and one said that we will go out. 

We're going to take a potato. The other said, and herring. The other said, no, we wouldn't take herring, not to spoil the taste from the-- the potato. We were dreaming day and night of food. 

INTERVIEWER 1: That's all you talked about. 

HELEN S.: Only about food. We didn't talk about-- I remember the girls, everybody was-- had so many lice in [INAUDIBLE] that I remember their-- their bodies, they were just like [? chapped ?] meat. Mine, no, mine wasn't. 

I don't know what kind of flavor-- probably didn't like my blood. I had more lice than anybody else, but I didn't have [? chapped ?] meat. 

INTERVIEWER 1: On your skin or on your clothes or-- 

HELEN S.: No, on the-- on the-- on the-- on the clothes, on the shirt. Well, I remember one day they were yellow, the other day were, uh, were-- gray. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Some people have told us about the problem of having your own dish or bowl. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, yeah, this one-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Can you tell us about that a little bit? 

HELEN S.: Yeah. We had-- when we were-- when we had, uh, in Gleiwitz, we had wooden beds. We had to wash them every Sunday. 

INTERVIEWER 1: The beds? 

HELEN S.: The beds, take out-- uh, I don't remember. No, take in water from the washroom. And we had maybe three-- we were 300 girls. That's what I remember. We had maybe 9 dish-- what is it-- pans to wash in. And they had the hose and the tap. Now, how can you do it? It was so hard. And sometimes you have to even say, [INAUDIBLE]. No, we had [INAUDIBLE] dishes. I remember. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You had what? 

HELEN S.: For to-- for our soup, what we got at night, sometimes was a potato in the soup. And we had, uh, uh, I don't remember. It wasn't porcelain. It wasn't-- wasn't-- I don't know. It was [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] I don't know how you call this in English, just a plain-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: Enamel. 

HELEN S.: Enam-- enamel, yeah. 

INTERVIEWER 1: An enamel dish. 

HELEN S.: Yeah. We had a-- I don't remember if we had a-- a fork, a spoon. Who talks about it? I don't remember where that was. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did you have-- did you have to worry about keeping that bowl? Was there a worry that somebody would take it, or that you would lose it? 

HELEN S.: I-- I-- I just don't remember where I kept this bowl, [INAUDIBLE]. No, we-- everybody had a bowl. This was-- we had comfort in Gleiwitz. We had a bowl. We very important because we were working for the war, for the-- for the-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: How did you clean your bowl every day? 

HELEN S.: We had, um, a-- water. We had water because we were working in the dark. We had always dark. We went over there where we were washing, where we were taking baths-- showers. We didn't have baths-- showers. 

And they had something. They gave us soap too. And we were washing our bowls too. And when they found a piece of paper once, they took us out from the-- from-- I remember, from the shower. 

They made us kneel, cold, wet, hours. To-- to-- who put this piece of paper? And then they found that piece of paper. 

One girl said I was-- I was surprised that you didn't say you did it. I says, I didn't know where the paper was. And finally, we didn't know they'd found the piece of paper. They just made up stories too. They found a piece of paper on the-- on the-- yard or some, whatever they could. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And they made you kneel where? 

HELEN S.: Oh, kneel, on this-- this-- there were the stones. They were [INAUDIBLE]. Were kneel-- we were kneeling. It's hard to describe what they did to us. You cannot describe this in years. And when I am just the way I am, healthy and, um, it's just because I-- I don't think back. I said, you have to go on. We have a few kids, and we have to take care. 

INTERVIEWER 1: How long did they force you to kneel? 

HELEN S.: I-- hours. Hours later, they got us in. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What were you wearing? 

HELEN S.: Nothing. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Nothing at all? 

HELEN S.: We-- we took, um, some of them, they were wrapped. Some of them were, uh, not. We were wearing this, uh, they gave us the-- I don't remember what everybody got a chance to put on. I-- I wasn't naked, no. I remember I was dressed when I was kneeling. I was-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: What is-- what is being dressed mean? 

HELEN S.: Dressed, we were-- we had a shirt. We had, uh, um, a dress and this overcoat. 

INTERVIEWER 1: You had a coat. 

HELEN S.: This was-- this, not-- this was the uniform, the [? [NON-ENGLISH] ?] uniform, the prisoners, like the prisoners you see on the-- in the [? Sing-Sing. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was this winter when you were kneeling? 

HELEN S.: Winter, I think that was winter, yeah, yeah. They didn't care, winter or summer at all. They did-- I just don't know, you know? I feel sorry for them on the top. I'm so sorry for myself. 

How can I feel sorry for them? How, for all those killers? They are so-- they asked me once to be on jury duty, twice. I refused. I-- I-- I send a registered letter that I'm an unqualified. 

Because I can never see a criminal. But those criminals make everybody smell like a rose. What I saw in my life, they-- I-- I couldn't-- I couldn't be on a jury duty because I would-- a boy who takes away a pocketbook. What is-- what's wrong with that? He takes away because he's hungry. 

But if somebody comes into your house and kills you because you are a Jew, this is wrong. Takes away everything. There's not a friend to give you a chance to survive. 

One cousin-- oh, I forgot. From the [INAUDIBLE], my two cousins, they survived [? the war. ?] They had a factory in [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] The name of the factory was [INAUDIBLE]. And I [? worked ?] from their factory. It was, uh, hiding her and her daughter in a hole for years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What kind of a hole? 

HELEN S.: I-- she-- she said that once for Christmas, he gave them a bread. It was so dark that after a month, the da-- mother said, I'm eating. And the daughter says, I'm eating. Later, she saw that the bread is whole. The mother saved the bread for the daughter, and the daughter saved bread for the mother. 

It was dark. She never described me. Anyways, when she writes, she was very rich and given plenty. But when she wrote to him always in the letters how thankful she is, he wrote her back. 

[? Franick, ?] his name, [INAUDIBLE], don't write that I saved you because the other Polacks will do something to me. He was afraid of the others that he saved two Jews. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And he say-- this man lived in Poland. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, a Polack. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And he saved two Jews. 

HELEN S.: Yeah, he was a Polack, and he-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: He hid them-- he hid them in a hole. 

HELEN S.: In a hole in their house someplace. She never just told me the exactly how, just what she told me when she wrote to him. 

INTERVIEWER 1: When-- then she's in this, came to this country? 

HELEN S.: No, she went to Israel, to Israel. 

INTERVIEWER 1: She went to Israel, and she wrote to him. 

HELEN S.: She wrote to him always. And she told me when I met her in Israel what [? Franick ?] wrote her. Don't you dare thank me, because I'm afraid of the rest of them that I saved your life. 

INTERVIEWER 1: And how long were they living with him? 

HELEN S.: I don't know. I didn't-- I think for two years. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mhm. Are-- are there any feelings you have about-- about Polish people or German people or any differences? Do you-- were some people good? 

HELEN S.: I remember my-- I have two friends. And she said, when you go, can't you-- my daughter brought me a tape recorder to [? listen. ?] I didn't-- And she says, can't you talk about these Germans? I says, before I go talk about the Germans, I have to talk about the Polacks. Because I never found a lower German than a Polack. 

I'm telling the truth. I was born there, raised there, went to their schools, took-- knew their history, know their modern day. I was-- and I get still-- and I-- even I see a hungry Polack on the television, I-- I feel sorry for him, because I am a sick person. If you cannot be just straight and give everybody what he deserves, you are a sick person too, if you are too good. 

I feel sorry for them. Yeah, I feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for my friends when they came and they wanted the furniture to buy, and start to think, maybe I can save somebody. 

INTERVIEWER 1: What friends came to buy furniture? 

HELEN S.: Oh, this is this younger sister. I had one sister, but I told you, we went for the silver. She had very nice furniture. And she liked the furniture. 

She didn't say, uh, look, I can save a life. I can save-- maybe you have something to save. She came just [? for, ?] can I buy the furniture? And my sister said, no, you can't. And my sister said, aye, but it will be the last thing. I wouldn't sent that to a friend who cames to you to buy the furniture when your life is in danger. 

INTERVIEWER 1: I-- I-- I'm not sure. I don't-- not sure what you're saying. This friend of yours went to your sister to buy her furniture. 

HELEN S.: She came in, and she said, don't you just-- this was in the beginning. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Mm-hmm. 

HELEN S.: Everything was in the beginning. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Yes. 

HELEN S.: She says, [INAUDIBLE], whatever my sister's name was, I would like to buy the furniture. Because my sister had nice furniture, and she liked the furniture. She wanted to buy it. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Because she knew that she was Jewish and she needed the money? 

HELEN S.: Sure, and she-- and she-- I don't know what she thought. But my sister says, I don't sell it. I-- I think-- I consider myself as a sick person too. If you cannot-- if you can feel sorry for them, if you can feel-- feel sorry for people that did so much to you-- I didn't go into my grandfather's house. But they said they took away all the-- the [INAUDIBLE] from-- they were looking for gold. 

This was only on their mind, the gold. And when my cousin, Hadassah, went, she said that they did away with the house. Was no more the grandfather's house there. This other house was another un-- the other uncle's house. We weren't poor. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Did he have gold in the house? 

HELEN S.: We were very [INAUDIBLE]. 

INTERVIEWER 1: Was there gold in the house? 

HELEN S.: With-- in my-- in our house? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Your grandfather's house. 

HELEN S.: I don't know what they did with the gold. I know about ours. We put every-- the ring I-- I remember I took off. We put every piece of gold. First, they collecting, and later, we needed 15,000 to bring my nephew back from [INAUDIBLE], from wherever he was in [INAUDIBLE]. 

We didn't have a penny. We didn't have a piece of gold. [? I hid ?] the silver. No, we gave everything away for [INAUDIBLE]. We were waiting for a [? dollar, ?] for a [INAUDIBLE], mark, whatever they say. 

They never had a kind word. The-- the Polacks, they used to say, when the Jews were crying, they used to say, why you are crying? You're never-- you didn't-- you didn't bring this from Palestine here. Nothing belong to you. 

And in the good times, they said, um, we are not sorry about the houses. What you are building here, they will belong to us. We are only sorry that you are eating so good. That's what you can not have. 

And I feel sorry for them when I see they're not that hungry. Don't you dare think that when they show you they are so hungry. They're not hungry like a Jew. But still, when I see a Polack, I feel sorry for him. 

They were dreaming about the Poland. Poland, I think they wrote a book. I didn't read it. They read-- they wrote a book, Polska [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] How, I don't know. 

I rem-- oh, I remember correctly-- "Poland without the Jews," they wrote a book. I never read this book. But I have a-- now they have a Poland without the Jews. Their dream came true. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. 

HELEN S.: If you need any pictures, I can-- 

INTERVIEWER 1: No, it's fine. 

HELEN S.: It's sad, right? 

INTERVIEWER 1: Very sad. 

HELEN S.: You have to be strong. You have to know how to put your life together, not to-- I never look up at those pictures. Now, they've told me that somebody came from Europe. [INAUDIBLE] think I have in New York some pictures from the ghetto. 

They didn't have a chance to-- they-- they are too valuable to send them. What else can you say? Maybe you have something to say. 

INTERVIEWER 1: No, I-- I just to say thank you. Thank you very much. Now? Uh, you'll tell me when to-- [INAUDIBLE] is he-- is he shut down? 

CREW: Yeah, we're out. 

INTERVIEWER 1: OK. 

HELEN S.: [? Frank? ?] I'm watching you always, [INAUDIBLE].
