[SIDE CONVERSATION] INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE] 

SUBJECT: I didn't want to be in Bochnia at the time. And it was a possibility, if you can call it like that, there was somebody who told me that I can go to Krakow at that time. And they went to Krakow with my mother. Not together, but she and me. Of course, without this-- 

INTERVIEWER: Armband? 

SUBJECT: --this armband. I thought-- then I thought that maybe it would be better not to go back to the ghetto and to run away. But where? If you have no place you are Jewish. So we came to ghetto again. 

INTERVIEWER: What did your passport say? What did your passport say? The passport the Gestapo lady had gotten? 

SUBJECT: Oh, that is-- it's what elsewise. It's what everybody has in ghetto, that I am Jewish, and that they work. And when-- you know, after the second deportation, the ghetto were-- they made it-- Germans make it smaller and smaller and smaller. 

Every day you have to move from one wall to the other. At the end I think it were two or three streets. It wasn't avenues, you know? Streets in a small city, in a small place, like-- like Bochnia. I think we were 16 persons in one room, with three beds, one on the other, above the other. 

And one day I thought that I can't move. I has a-- I had the claustrophobia. I couldn't manage to live with this every day. So it was you know, it-- I-- I felt as-- as if somebody's 

INTERVIEWER 2: Choking. 

SUBJECT: Yes, choking me. So I have a friend who left before for Warsaw. And he lived as a Christian. And he helped me to make Christian papers for me and for my mother. And we fled away from-- from the ghetto. 

And from this moment, we were illegal. Yes, it's quite another story. Every step and every-- every word, everything was under control. 

What to say and how to look and how to speak and how to move. And I was with eyeglasses. And you know, the Christians Polish don't-- they-- they didn't [? [NON-ENGLISH]. ?] 

INTERVIEWER 2: Didn't wear eyeglasses. 

SUBJECT: They didn't wear eye glasses. So I had to put it off. And I was in the street went like this to see and [INAUDIBLE]. But I was afraid. 

INTERVIEWER 2: You thought this would identify you? 

SUBJECT: Of course. All the time. And in-- more so, it was a very hard time. There were many, many moments that we wanted to go back. 

INTERVIEWER: You went from Krakow to Warsaw? 

SUBJECT: Yes. Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: How? 

SUBJECT: By train. 

INTERVIEWER: You managed to get on a train and not be identified?

When somebody go comes to you and tell you-- and told you you are a Jew. Give me so and so much money and I will let you go. And if no, you go with me to the [INAUDIBLE] street, that was the street where there was the Gestapo. 

It was at home. It was in the street. It was everywhere. 

INTERVIEWER: How could you have enough money to pay these people? 

SUBJECT: I hadn't. I had given my watch and my bracelet and what I-- what I had. We didn't have money. Not me, not my mother. It was very, very hard. 

INTERVIEWER: How did you live? 

SUBJECT: First of all, we were afraid all the time. We were so frightened. It was a time where it was the end of the ghetto for some. And when I go by train in the street, I saw the ghetto was burning, you know? From the-- from the side. 

And at night, in the evening, there was [INAUDIBLE]. That means after 8:00, you have not the right to go out from the-- from the-- curfew. And there was many time I hadn't where to go. I didn't have-- I didn't have where to go. So I slept in the gardens on ruins. 

There were from the bombs that were in the beginning of the war in Warsaw. This feeling, when you see people at 7 or 7:30 in the evening, you see people go home. Everybody go home, goes home, went home. And me? I am-- I am no no place to go to. 

How can you tell such-- such things? You must feel it. Yes, and it was a few months we were in Warsaw till October, maybe. 

INTERVIEWER: Your mother was there with you? 

SUBJECT: Yes, but we are not together. We are not together. We are living in-- 

INTERVIEWER 2: Different places. 

SUBJECT: --different places. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you do that on purpose? 

SUBJECT: Of course. 

INTERVIEWER 2: Why?

INTERVIEWER 2: You thought you had more of a chance-- 

SUBJECT: Of course, of course. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you keep in touch?

INTERVIEWER 2: Sewing lady, seamstress. 

SUBJECT: Yes. And me too without knowing what I was doing. You had to work. 

It was impossible to go in the streets all the time and not to sit at home, for I had a room, a family. And they asked me what I'm doing. Of course, I'm working. 

INTERVIEWER: Where did you get the work and where did you get the place to do the sewing? 

SUBJECT: Oh, I was working by somebody. Not at home. At a seamstress. 

INTERVIEWER: Okay.

SUBJECT: Walk, of course. Oh, very far, very far. It was-- it was a very hard task. And my mother was not of my age. 

It was several moments that she told I remain here. I don't want to go farther. And they were with us, another two young boys who took her and we went further. 

INTERVIEWER: How long did it take to walk to Hungary? 

SUBJECT: One night. Of course with a luck. For there were sentries who were patrolling all over. But we had luck. 

INTERVIEWER 2: How long were you in the war zone? 

SUBJECT: 9 months. It was much too much. 

INTERVIEWER 2: When you were hiding and running all the time. 

SUBJECT: Not hiding not. I was in the street, I was-- I was working, I was-- but I was afraid. When-- when someone-- somebody asked me once what's your birthday? When is your birthday? And birthday is in the name of the son of dissent of my name-- and my name was not as now. 

I was Stefanya Balitska. And I didn't know where Stefanya, so I said without-- without thinking much. But-- and what of a sudden, he said but one moment Stephanya, it is not on this day. It is-- it's another day.
