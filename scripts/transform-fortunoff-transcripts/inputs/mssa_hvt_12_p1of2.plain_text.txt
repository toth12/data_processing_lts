DORI LAUB: Rom-- 

DORA RESCH: It's a suburb-- 

SALO RESCH: It's a suburb of Czernowitz. 

DORA RESCH: --of Czernowitz. 

DORI LAUB: In Romania.

DORI LAUB: Thank you. 

LAUREL VLOCK: And you, Doctor Resch? 

SALO RESCH: I was born in Czernowitz on December 24, 1919. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Are you a physician now? 

SALO RESCH: No. I am now working as a shipping supervisor in a plant-- in Deitsch Plastics in West Haven, Connecticut. 

DORI LAUB: So what is Czernowitz like? Let's go back. 

DORA RESCH: Czernowitz was one of the greatest city. They always used to call it "Klein Paris." This means "Small Paris." 

SALO RESCH: Not "Klein Paris," "Klein Wien." 

DORA RESCH: "Klein Paris" auch. 

SALO RESCH: OK. Somebody says-- some people compared it to Paris. Some people compared it to Vienna. So it-- 

DORA RESCH: Yeah, but the "Klein Paris," that's what they always used to say. It was a beautiful town. 

SALO RESCH: It's a city, not a town. 

DORA RESCH: A city, OK. Please. 

SALO RESCH: [LAUGHS] 

DORA RESCH: Don't make me nervous. 

SALO RESCH: OK. 

DORA RESCH: You do. It was very live-able. Everything you had in this town-- any-- everything-- industry, full with life. I remember the beautiful things. I don't wanna remember the bad things. But-- [SIGHS] it was good till 1940. 

DORI LAUB: What would a Jewish family do on a-- a Saturday evening, or a young Jewish woman? 

DORA RESCH: Well, they always used to come, the neighbors, together. It-- 

SALO RESCH: There was a lot of social life there. There was-- 

DORI LAUB: Yes. 

SALO RESCH: --um, movies. There was theater. There was a Jewish theater in Czernowitz. There was, uh, a lot of very, very live-- 

DORA RESCH: Live-able. 

SALO RESCH: Live-able, where it's lifted you up-- 

DORA RESCH: Full with life. 

SALO RESCH: --because you could go all over. It was at that time-- that was a free-- a free society. It was not like, uh, now, under Communist rule. 

DORI LAUB: Did you-- do you go to cafe house? 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. We used to go every Saturday evening, uh, after work. Saturday evenings, we used go for dancing-- 

DORA RESCH: Dancing 

SALO RESCH: --at, uh, Schwarzer Adler. The Schwarzer Adler, that was in the center of city. Then there was, uh, Cafe L'Europe. Whatever it is was-- 

DORI LAUB: Can you describe the Schwarzer Adler? 

SALO RESCH: Uh, that was a big building that was a hotel. And they had-- downstairs, they had a big restaurant where you could-- you could, uh, dance, and it was all evening, till mornings. 

DORA RESCH: Until 10:00. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did you listen to the news a lot? Did you know what was happening in Europe? Were you aware? 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. There was-- till-- till the war started, you had a lot of newspapers. Everything was publicized. Even, uh, there was a lot of discrimination, but not in a big-- in a big measure. 

DORI LAUB: Did-- there was a Jewish population in Czernowitz? 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. 

DORA RESCH: Oh. 

SALO RESCH: Over-- over 60,000-- 

DORA RESCH: Two-- 

SALO RESCH: --people. 60,000. 

DORI LAUB: Out of how many? 

SALO RESCH: Uh, Czernowitz, including the suburbs, was quoted of having a population of over 200,000 people. 

DORA RESCH: Correct. 

SALO RESCH: It was the third largest city of Romania. After Bucharest was Timisoara, the second. Czernowitz was-- no. Kishinev was the second. And Czernowitz was the third largest city. 

DORI LAUB: So a third of the population was Jewish. 

SALO RESCH: Yeah, roughly a third of the population. 

DORI LAUB: And what kind of, uh, Jewish institutions, organizations? 

SALO RESCH: You had, uh, a lot of-- you had a lot of, uh, synagogues. There was a big-- one of the nicest temples, but, uh, unfortunately, the Rom-- the Romanians, when they-- when was the temple, uh, burned down? I don't recall. During the Russians when they returned first? I don't know. 

DORA RESCH: Correct. 

SALO RESCH: '40 or '41 I don't know. It was one of the nicest temples, a big-- a big temple. Then there had a lot of synagogues, almost in every-- you can say, you turned around, you had synagogues. There was a lot of Jewish life. You had the Jewish theater. 

DORA RESCH: Hebrew Day schools. 

SALO RESCH: You had the Jewish theater too. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did you know each other? 

DORA RESCH: No. 

SALO RESCH: No, just after-- 

DORA RESCH: We didn't. 

SALO RESCH: --the war. 

DORI LAUB: Zionist organizations? 

SALO RESCH: What? 

DORA RESCH: Yes. 

DORI LAUB: The Zionists. 

SALO RESCH: Oh yeah, you had uni-- you had the university. Uh, one of the nicest buildings in the whole Balkan, not just Romania-- [STAMMERS] including you had-- the Balkan is Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, all around, Hungary. Now, one of the nicest buildings was, uh, the Metropoli. Uh, like a Metropoli, like a-- it's like-- 

I don't know how to-- how to describe it. Uh, Metropolia-- they are saying in Romania Metropolia. But it was, uh, like belonging to the Orthodox Church, or whatever it is. Was one of the nicest buildings in the whole Balkan. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. I know this. But was there Zionist organization who were active? 

SALO RESCH: Yeah, there was a lot of, uh, active, uh-- you had a lot of, uh, Jewish organizations like, uh, Trumpeldor, and Gordonja, and all this-- 

DORA RESCH: My brothers-- my two brothers belonged to the Betarim. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

DORA RESCH: We was a-- 

SALO RESCH: [INAUDIBLE] 

DORA RESCH: Like, not Hebrew Day. Here is Hebrew Day. Bais Yaakov shul. Bais Yaakov school. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Was there much, uh, interaction between the Jewish community and the non-Jewish community? Did you have many friends who were-- 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. 

DORA RESCH: Oh, yes. 

SALO RESCH: Yeah, there were-- 

DORA RESCH: There was no-- we had a lot of friends-- 

SALO RESCH: A lot of Gentile-- 

DORA RESCH: --who were not Jewish and Jewish. 

SALO RESCH: Gentile neighbors was-- we was in very good relations. 

DORA RESCH: Very good relations. This-- when-- even when it start the war in 1940 and the rations came in, so nobody was touched. But after then, it started the war, in 1941. The neighbors tried to help us. 

When we was already for two weeks in Lager-- they took us in Lager-- they brought us food and everything. And it was a free hand, like when they came in in 1941. So for a few days, they killed and murdered the youngest people-- young boys, young girls. 

SALO RESCH: Three days, they had-- 

DORA RESCH: Three days, they had a free hand, like they say, a free hand. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

DORA RESCH: So they-- like a dog, they shot you down without any reason, just because you was Jewish. But our house, they never let nobody in because my parents, no-- they was with no-- how should I say? Not because-- see, my parents, they was very-- the nicest people. Nobody touched us. 

DORI LAUB: Who? 

DORA RESCH: When they wanna go in, they said, oh, no, this people, was-- they didn't harm nobody either way, not against any politics or something. They didn't let even go in in our house. 

DORI LAUB: Who-- who did the killing? 

DORA RESCH: Who did the killing? 

SALO RESCH: Uh-- 

DORA RESCH: The paramilitar. 

SALO RESCH: That was-- it was in 1941 when the Germans with the Romanian troops came back to Czernowitz, occupied again Czernowitz. Because in 1940, the Russians took that city over. And when the war between Germany and Russia erupted in June, 1941, approximately two weeks after that-- I think it was in July 5, if I am not mistaken-- 

DORA RESCH: Correct. 

SALO RESCH: --the German troops and the Romanian troops, together they came through the city. So they had a free hand. And with mostly, there was a lot of Ukrainians civil-- the civil people. Well, they tried to-- they-- they was against Jews mostly. They was, uh, anti-Semitic. 

So the first three days, they-- for instance, they came. They closed up a street and went from house to house, tooked out-- 

DORA RESCH: [SIGHS] 

SALO RESCH: --the men-- mostly just men, young middle aged men, and-- 

DORA RESCH: Shot them like dogs. 

SALO RESCH: Plain shot the down-- shot them down. In this three days, there was over 2,000 casualties. Young-- young men was shot down. There was, uh, uh, one day they tooked about 1,500 people to the Kultur Palats. It was a big palace where they just was made, uh-- shortly before that, it was builded, had a lot of hall walls, glass walls. 

They took the people in there. And after, uh, having a big speech, they said, no, you are free to go home. And as soon as they turned out to go home, um, from behind, they was with-- 

DORA RESCH: [SIGHS] 

SALO RESCH: --uh, machine guns. 

DORI LAUB: The lives. 

SALO RESCH: They-- whoever could manage to ran and to survive survived, but a lot of people was killed at that time. 

DORI LAUB: And those were, uh-- 

SALO RESCH: German-- uh, from of-- in the Kultur Palats, it was a German group. But otherwise, it was Romanian soldiers. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Where were you? Do you remember exactly what you were doing when this happened? 

SALO RESCH: I-- in this three days, I had a good friend, a Ukrainian. He came the first day when it happened. He came to our house, and he invited me-- actually, he took me-- we was very good friends, and he took me to his house. And this three days, I was until he came. He said, now it's over. You can go home, back. 

DORI LAUB: And how old were you then? 

SALO RESCH: What? 

DORI LAUB: How old were you then? 

SALO RESCH: I-- how old I was? I was 23 years old already. So then after-- after the three days, they started making working groups, young men to go to work, whatever, just for a loaf of bread. You worked a whole day for a loaf of bread. 

I, for instance, worked at the-- Czernowitz had a big airport, and that was-- as soon as on-- in June 22, when they started the war, the Germans bombed that airport. There was a lot of airplanes at that time, Russian airplanes. They was damaged. So we had to clean them up. The whole thing, that-- it tooks-- there-- there was a lot of-- my brother and my brother-in-law, who lives now in Israel, that was at that time, we knew [INAUDIBLE]. So we went there as work-- a working group. 

Then we started working as painters. Months, there was a big, like, a hotel. There was around 180 or hundred-- or close to. I don't recall exactly the amount of rooms. Well, they had to be repainted. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Who decided what you would do? 

SALO RESCH: That was, uh-- a Rom-- uh, commander was a Romanian major was a commander, and it was under his supervision. See, they had to restore that that hotel should be livable again and that airport should be able to be useful. So all the construction took months. We had seven professional painters. Well, they was professionals. And we was helping them to work. 

DORI LAUB: Now, what were the-- were there any regulations, laws against Jews at that time? 

SALO RESCH: They had to ta-- we had to-- we had to wear the yellow star. That was constantly to be wear. So we went, for instance-- shortly after the-- let's say a week or two, when it started a little-- a little bit to normalize, they tooked gr-- groups. Our group went to work at the airport. Some groups went to work other places. 

For a whole day of work, we got a loaf of bread, a kilo. That's roughly a little bit over two pounds. We was happy to have that bread, because we came home with a loaf of bread. 

So this-- that's-- at that place, we worked till October the 11th. Like today, I remember. We didn't even know that they-- uh, they want to make a ghetto. 

We came to the gate there to work, and a corporal there started laughing. He said-- we was maybe four or five guys. He said, what are you doing here? You didn't read the announcement? 

There was little announcements placed on several places where it said, up till 6 o'clock in the evening, it's proclaimed a ghetto. You didn't even know exactly which streets was proclaimed ghetto. But they gave us till 6 o'clock in the evening to clear up wherever we lived. And we started-- you sh-- you could see-- I, for instance, took, let's say, a-- a-- I don't know what. A big-- 

DORI LAUB: A bag. 

SALO RESCH: A package, some linen, whatever it is, put on my shoulders, and started go-- started going down where we was-- we lived one time. We came down there. From there, people came up with little carriages. We didn't-- until we finally knew, that was, uh, the Oberebahnhofstrasse near the railroad station. 

They allowed that there was the railroad station. Then it was the Jewish, uh, hospital. There was a Jewish hospital there that was still-- uh, that was proclaimed the ghetto part of the city. Then two days later, we had to move from there because the ob-- uh, the-- that part of the street-- because having access to the railroad was not allowed to be anymore-- 

DORA RESCH: [SIGHS] 

SALO RESCH: --in the ghetto included. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did your friend, the Ukrainian boy who helped you, did he know what was happening to you? Did you talk to him? 

SALO RESCH: The funny part on it, I-- a couple of months later, he's-- he-- he was a, uh, Ukrainian nationalist. He was-- he wanted to have a free Ukraine. So he-- I saw him a couple of months later in a German uniform, a German SS uniform. 

When he saw me on the street, because being so friends-- so close friends, he turned away in another street that we shouldn't come to each other's face. But that's what it turns-- it turned out. He was later-- a couple of months later, he was in a SS-- a German SS uniform. 

LAUREL VLOCK: But prior to that, when you first had to wear the Jewish star, what was his reaction to that? 

SALO RESCH: We was-- I'm telling you. We-- he came-- he actual-- like, I owe-- it's possible that I might have been killed in this three days, in the turmoil. We don't know. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Mm-hmm. 

SALO RESCH: Later on, I-- I-- I haven't seen him anymore because maybe he perished. I don't know what happened, but, uh-- but he was-- he was two years older than me. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What were other Romanian people saying to you about having to wear the star, having to be displaced? Was there any-- 

DORA RESCH: A lot-- excuse me. A lot was very unhappy, for instance, our neighbors. I had completely different because when the ration came back-- when the Romanian for the German took over again, after the ration, we was occupied with the ration. They took us right away in Lager. And they make from the school, they took all the people. I was just in the suburb, in J-- Jucica Veche. 

We was there for two weeks. And after two weeks, they said we have to take what we can carry on our back, and we have to go. And we went from the morning, since 5 o'clock in the morning, till dark night, when it start completely dark, we was walking, marching, till Nepolokoutz. This was the Polish border, and there-- I was young. I had 15 years. 

Everybody-- we wasn't very rich, but we was a wealthy family. So August 2, they came to us, paramilitar, like 18, 19 years old. I had a ring on my finger. They ripped off with my finger. From my father, a golden watch with a gold, uh, chain. 

DORI LAUB: Chain. 

DORA RESCH: And my parents-- then my father said, this is probably very-- we're in a very bad position. This is probably gonna be the end of us. And it was pouring. They led us-- we didn't have no roof over our head. Day and night, just marching. 

The Poland did not meet us. They didn't let us in. So they took us back, and we went all to Bessarabia. We went to the Dniester, but this takes weeks and weeks without any food. We didn't see no towns, just-- 

SALO RESCH: Field. 

DORA RESCH: --field. 

LAUREL VLOCK: You were just walking? 

SALO RESCH: Walking. 

DORA RESCH: Walking in line, walking-- dusty, filthy, hunger. When we came in Mogilev, we-- 

DORI LAUB: Just a moment. Uh, that was done by the Romanians. 

DORA RESCH: The Romanian with the German together. 

SALO RESCH: Yeah, but the-- 

DORI LAUB: The German. 

SALO RESCH: --the Germans, uh-- the Rom-- mostly the Romanians took that, uh, that-- 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. Where would you sleep at night? 

DORA RESCH: Just on the field. Just on the field. 

DORI LAUB: And how big a-- a group was it, the convoy? 

DORA RESCH: How big we was? We was a few thousand people. 

DORI LAUB: Just walking under guards. 

DORA RESCH: Walk-- walking under six or eight paramilitars. 

SALO RESCH: Small group. 

DORA RESCH: Very small group. We could kill them with no-- no boo. But who would start something? We was chicken. We was-- you know, we was-- I don't know. I-- I don't find the word what to say, but we are taught that's what it is. 

When we came, we had to walk, and you know, we was hungry. We start to realize some people had God in their heart, and they give us a piece of bread. But we was very [INAUDIBLE] each other. We-- we was-- hunger hurts very much. 

This was day and night. No change clothes, no washing yourself, no rest, from-- like I said, from 5 o'clock till the dark time. When we came in Mogilev, it was two weeks. There it was-- 

DORI LAUB: Did people die on the way? 

DORA RESCH: Oh, sure. For thirst and for hunger, sure. When we are cross the-- the bridge, you-- parents-- you hear just this screaming and the yelling because it w-- was already in the dark, and we decide they have to cross. A lot fell in in the water. You heard the screaming and yelling. It was grausam, terrible. But, you know, we didn't have no choice. 

When we came there, the-- the place was in a big place. The German, in this two weeks, they treat us not bad. After two weeks, they said we have to pack ourself, and we have to go again. And Ukraina is very, very-- 

DORI LAUB: Now, the Dniester is the border between Romania and the Ukraina. 

SALO RESCH: That was-- 

DORA RESCH: Yes-- 

SALO RESCH: --at that time. 

DORA RESCH: --at this time, [INAUDIBLE], yes. 

SALO RESCH: That's the river, Dniester. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

DORA RESCH: Dniester, this was a big-- 

SALO RESCH: Big river. 

DORA RESCH: --river. But just crossing the river, we lost a lot of people because, you know, the bridge was very primitive. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

DORA RESCH: And from the site. And then they push you. They push you like animals, not like human beings. 

SALO RESCH: who fell in, and he couldn't swim. Perished. 

DORA RESCH: That's it. We came there. We was for two weeks. Two weeks, the German give us food. 

We was happy because we had food, and we wasn't any more onto the field. We was in a big place. I don't know what it was there, a school or what it was. So-- but very crowded, one on top of the other, but we still was happy. We saw it's probably-- 

SALO RESCH: [INAUDIBLE] 

DORA RESCH: --the end, but we didn't know what. After two weeks, they start again, come over and say we have to pack, and we have to go. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did people-- did people complain? Did people cry? Did they-- 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. 

DORA RESCH: The people-- the older people-- we was children. We didn't realize how far it is, but I-- like now, I see my father and mother from my eyes. They say, it's probably the end of us. We are just gonna suffer. 

And we start, and again, the same thing, from in the morning till night. We was very hungry, very thirsty, in the-- in the line, like, marching in the line. And we was very dusty. 

We couldn't have a little bit water from a fountain, so just when it was a lake. And they realize. But because we are so-- were so many thousands, and they was just a few, when they noticed, they'd see you bend down, and you wanna take a little bit water, they shot you right there on the spot, just like they had fun of this, you know? 

LAUREL VLOCK: Is that why so few could control so many? 

DORA RESCH: Yes. 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. 

DORA RESCH: Yes. And w-- 

DORI LAUB: Were-- those were Romanian and Ukrainian? 

DORA RESCH: Just Romanian. 

SALO RESCH: Ukrainian. 

DORI LAUB: That's all. 

DORA RESCH: Romanian. This was Romanian. 

SALO RESCH: Oh, lots of them that was Ukrainian civil-- the civil. They were-- they was not military. 

DORI LAUB: Hmm 

DORA RESCH: They wasn't military. 

SALO RESCH: It was paramilitary. 

DORA RESCH: No. 

SALO RESCH: They was-- before going into the military service-- 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

SALO RESCH: --they had a three-year training period. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Why do you think they were marching you back and-- up and down? 

DORA RESCH: Just that we should-- 

SALO RESCH: That was their-- 

DORA RESCH: That's when we lost so many people. 

SALO RESCH: That was their purpose. 

DORA RESCH: It was- 

DORA RESCH: When we came already, this took months. We was walking day and night. Night, when it was very dark, that's then when we are stopped. But it was, again, in misery, in hunger. You know, it's unbelievable. This is incredible. And the last people, who was on the last, you know? 

LAUREL VLOCK: Last. 

DORA RESCH: Yes, so they was beating. So I always-- I was the youngest in my house. Right away, I took-- we had some clothes in our bag. I took off the clothes from my mother's back, and I said, we don't need it. Let push more to the front. 

In the beginning, my brother and sister, they said, you're crazy. With what is then mother gonna change? I said, I don't care. When she doesn't have nothing what to carry, we can be in the middle so they don't punish us. They always was pushing and, uh-- 

SALO RESCH: Hit-- hitting. 

DORA RESCH: --hitting us, you know? So I said, let's be. What we need clothes? We are not gonna to live anyway. What-- another day is another day. Then when we came, it was already very, very bitter cold. 

DORI LAUB: What month are you now? 

DORA RESCH: Oh, yeah, this was in winter. 

DORI LAUB: In wint-- winter 1941. 

DORA RESCH: Correct. 

DORI LAUB: December, 1941. 

DORA RESCH: December, 1941. So they put us in-- in a colhoz. A colhoz is like-- how you say in English? The farms, uh, OK? 

DORI LAUB: Cooperative farm. A cooperative farm. 

SALO RESCH: Farm, yes. 

DORA RESCH: Right. But there was just cement that was probably for animals, pigs or cows. Excuse me, can you give me a napkin from there? I have in my pocketbook. So-- 

SALO RESCH: Thank you. 

DORA RESCH: Thank you. So there-- [SIGHS] 

A-- we-- a lot of our people, we didn't have no clothes to change. We didn't have no food. What was our food? When they carried us on on the fields, a corn, a beet, from the pumpkin. We was eating all this raw. 

You know, we become like animals. We didn't care about your brother, or sister, or father, or mother-- full-- very selfish. We become violent. We care just for ourself. 

LAUREL VLOCK: When they saw you forage for food, did they-- were they angry, the guards, if they saw you getting food? 

DORA RESCH: They was-- you know, like he said, they was laughing. Some turn around. Some was very rude, cruel, you know. Then we saw the best thing was not to be in the front, not in the back. In the front was them, and they was in the back. Do you understand what I am saying? 

So the best part was when you was in the middle. They didn't have a control over you. There you was your best chance to still survive another day, and another day, and another day, because in the front, they was kicking you around. In the back, the same thing. 

Like-- you know what they done? The young children, when we was going on the field, they wasn't able to go anymore. This was in ver-- on a [INAUDIBLE] just we saw the skies and earth. They make the big grave, and who wasn't able to go anymore, they buried them alive. And the earth was picking up because the people were still alive-- older people and very young who couldn't walk anymore. 

So they make just a grave because they said they're not gonna walk anymore. Get here, make the big grave, and put the other people. Give us the shovels. Here, you gonna go in. We had-- the people didn't even know what's gonna happen, but then we saw what they gonna do. You left, and, you know, you were so-- you didn't lea-- leaving one tear because you didn't care. 

SALO RESCH: You was hardened. 

DORA RESCH: Today, it's them. You was like a stone. Today, it's them, and tomorrow, it's gonna to be wir [us]. So, you know, you didn't cry. 

When we was arrived in kolkhoz, like I said, there was a farm. Like now, I see it from my eyes. Our neighbors was father, mother, and two sons. And they say, you see, one thing, we don't wanna live with each other. When we have to die, we should die every-- in the same day. 

And I-- I was very young then, and I said, how this people talk? What you mean? You-- you can order? You wanna die? Which turn is gonna come? 

But that's how it was. When they couldn't walk anymore, and in the same day, they put them in grave. They was still alive. That's it. But they wasn't able to walk anymore. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Who dug the graves? 

DORA RESCH: Who dug the graves? This few paramilitars, who were still a little bit in strength who could do it, they put our people to do it and buried them alive. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Hmm. Who survived in your family? 

DORA RESCH: In-- you see, all these things what I'm telling you, we was ver-- young, but we was very close. When we had just one bite, we shared. And the biggest problems was we was, we shared with each other. My two brothers and sister, we all survived, but the rest of the family-- 

SALO RESCH: Her father passed away the first winter. 

DORA RESCH: My father, he d-- passed away. He was-- he-- for hunger. Hunger is terrible. When hunger hurts, you can't sleep. When you're hungry, you cannot sleep. 

SALO RESCH: No, just [INAUDIBLE] in typhoid. D-- d-- being not managed, nothing. 

DORA RESCH: You see, I had my feet. On in a year-- a year and a half, my feet was frozen. I couldn't get up on my feet. Then when we was already in Bershad, in colhoz, like, there on the farm, I couldn't get up on my feet. 

I was taking my two fists, and I said, I wish I die already. I shouldn't suffer so much. I can't take it. 

And my mother said, you're gonna get better. You're gonna get better. I said, I don't wanna get better. I don't care. And you believe me, when my father passed away, we didn't cry. We didn't. 

DORI LAUB: He-- 

DORA RESCH: It was-- 

DORI LAUB: He died with you in the same-- 

DORA RESCH: That's right, in the s-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: While walking and he died? 

DORA RESCH: Not walking. 

DORI LAUB: No. 

DORA RESCH: We was already then-- when it was very da-- when we had came to the point when we came in Bershad. And in this place, they left us there. Then we didn't-- then we didn't march anymore. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What did you do in the place? 

DORA RESCH: Nothing. 

SALO RESCH: Nothing. 

DORA RESCH: We was just-- 

SALO RESCH: It was made a ghetto 

DORA RESCH: A ghetto for us. And there, when the people died, it was very bitter cold in the Ukraina. And I don't know if you heard, there is very harsh winters. So they couldn't even make graves for the people who died. 

The undertakers was very rude. They came, and when you had clothes on you, they took off. But my two brothers didn't let them to take out my father. They took him out themself. 

They came with the-- [SIGHS] like, small carriages they had with the horse, and they carried them, you know, like-- like that-- I don't know how to-- throw them on the, uh, wagons and brought them out on the field. But they couldn't make a grave. When it start warming up, then was carried around by dogs a leg, and a hat, and a body. Then they maked a mass grave and put all this people. 

SALO RESCH: The remainder of them. 

DORA RESCH: The remainder. 

SALO RESCH: It was terrible. It was not-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: You mean dogs were attacking the dead bodies? 

DORA RESCH: Yes. Yes. Dogs, wolves. 

SALO RESCH: Because it was-- 

DORA RESCH: It was very-- 

SALO RESCH: it was-- it was left in the open. 

LAUREL VLOCK: You saw this? 

DORA RESCH: I saw it. Sure, I saw it. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Your father died of hunger? 

SALO RESCH: Hunger and-- 

DORA RESCH: That's right, hunger. [SIGHS] 

You know, I was young, I looked-- and I didn't look like Jewish. So this was what I did in not the first year, after I was better. So I went out in the colhoz. This mean like in the farm. 

And this was already good. This was in '43. And I worked a whole day just for a glass of-- it's like, uh, kasha? You would say it Hirse. That's what they say. 

So when I came home, when they caught me a lot of times getting in in the ghetto-- you see, your dress is black when I don't make no mistake. That's how they beat me when they caught me. They said, what I'm doing? A lot of-- and I-- a lot of times I could ran away, and a lot of times I couldn't. So I said I was hungry, and I wanted to bring for my mother something to eat. That's why I went out to work. And they k-- a whole day I was working. 

I was like this-- a schelet. When you see me, you would be scared. But they didn't have no heart, just like worser than animals. Believe me, here the animals are treated like kings, like human beings. We was mistreated. 

This is incredible. Because believe me, I asked myself a lot of times, oh, it's possible that a human being can go so much through and still survive. I'm one of this. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. 

You know how we was? You see when I put my hand like this in my hair? Thousands of lice. This body was all wounds just, you know, because the lice was eating us. 

They filled-- where we was laying down, probably this everything give u-- lice. Big lice was eating, and from eating, is we scratch us. And this make wounds. But somehow, here is blood leaking, and then it was healed from themselves, some miracles. 

This wasn't a day. This wasn't a week. This wasn't a month. Four and a half years. 

DORI LAUB: You got-- you came to Bershad later. 

SALO RESCH: What? 

DORI LAUB: You came later to Bershad. 

SALO RESCH: Yeah, we-- 

DORI LAUB: What happened? 

SALO RESCH: We was the lucky one. They was a little-- for them, was hard because they was taken right away and marched-- marched, uh, months to go. We was taken, uh-- they made it on October 11, At that time, they made it a ghetto. And three or four weeks later in November, they started making, uh, transports by railroad to send us over the Dniester to the Ukraine. 

DORI LAUB: To Transnistria. 

SALO RESCH: Yeah. My un-- I-- at-- at that time, I was at my uncle's place in Radautz, and we came up through the Mog-- to Mogilev. I don't know if you heard that's a death-- 

DORI LAUB: Yeah, but right around-- um, what about the ghetto in Czernowitz? 

SALO RESCH: The ghetto, to tell you the truth, I told you that on October 11, at that day, when we came to work at-- at-- at the airpl-- airport, they started laughing. How come you came? You didn't, uh, read? So finally, we realized what it is, and-- and the same day, after 6 o'clock, we had to be in that ghetto. We was at one place, and then two days later, we had to move in another place, the Morariugasse. 

DORI LAUB: Yeah-- yeah, what was it-- 

SALO RESCH: So people were so crowded, we lived in a attic from a long house, a big house. There was the attic in between-- in the attic, you have, uh, portions, for instance, between those-- it's-- it's a portion, let's say. Like this room-- families. 

We were seven people. It was five children and my father and mother. So we was-- when we went to lay down to sleep, we slept on the-- on the floor. So we slept like-- you see, like herrings. 

When all-- one had to turn around, all five had to turn around. We couldn't turn around one side to another side, one of them. You had to turn all. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What happened if someone didn't feel well or had to leave-- 

DORA RESCH: Excuse me, let me answer this. This was with us-- 

SALO RESCH: You didn't had-- you-- you didn't had a-- a lavatory to go out. 

DORA RESCH: We had-- I had to cry. They didn't-- You know, we didn't have a what to cover, and it was so bitter cold, in snow, in frost, in bare feet. I didn't have no-- oh, yeah, I didn't have no shoes. 

And I start crying. My body was all wounds. I-- I wanna turn around, and they didn't wanna turn around. They was-- you know, like, one body to the other, that's all what we had warm. We didn't have it what to cover us. 

And I start crying, and I start saying, I wanna die. I-- my mother used to say, please, just relax. Relax. I said, what should I relax? I wanna die. I can't take it anymore. I just wanna die. 

This-- you know, it's unbelievable. It's-- I can't believe it, it's true. Honest to God, I don't believe it. 

My nerves are very shocked. You can't touch them. When you touch them, it's just like a explosion, like the bomb atom. But it's no wonder. This went on so long, so many-- it's incredible. 

But hunger, misery. Washing-- what you mean washing yourself? We didn't have a little bit water for ourself, just a sip, never mind washing or change clothes. We didn't have no clothes. 

You know what my clothes was? From a sack. You know what a sack is? How you say in English it? 

LAUREL VLOCK: Potato sack. 

DORA RESCH: Sack is correct? What you carry flour or something like this-- this just turn around my body like this. We didn't have it. But one thing then came. He was in this town. He was a Romanian, but he was good. 

He said, look, you go out from the ghetto, and try to work, and bring from the people-- from the Ukrainian-- they give you some food. And in case you get out from the ghetto-- you're gonna be caught. They gonna bring you to us. And he said, I'm gonna let you go. 

I was hundreds of times caught. They beat me to my death. And I said, shoot me already. I can't take anymore. 

But they was laughing in your eyes and just punishing you, like-- how can I say-- torturing you. I said, my brother, who is now-- he came from Israel. They beat him so much that he lost his mind. He's still-- he's v-- he went crazy. 

DORI LAUB: Who did the beating again? 

DORA RESCH: Who beating? The Romanian. 

DORI LAUB: Romanian soldiers. 

DORA RESCH: Yes. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

DORA RESCH: Yes. My brother lost his mind. The only-- you know, he was-- this was already when it was better for us, what you mean better. Like I said, we went out from the ghetto, and we worked. The-- you wasn't allowed to do this. You done this on your risk. So you worked a whole day, you could bring probably 10 potatoes home because you took off on the field the potatoes. Or like I said-- 

SALO RESCH: Working something for peasants. 

DORA RESCH: For peasants. But he was caught, and they beat him so much, then he lost complete his mind. But he was very strong. Then my brother and my brother-in-law tied up his hand he shouldn't beat us. 

SALO RESCH: Your older brother. 

DORA RESCH: I have. So he was crying, and he said-- he said, how can you have a heart to do this to your own brother? So me and my sister was very weak. So we said, OK, it's my brother. How can we leave him like this? 

And soon we untie him, he grabbed me by the hair, turn around the whole house. All my hair remained in his arm. And we had just said to him-- we was screaming. He said, look, Jonas, you just said you're not gonna do this to us. 

But the man was sick, you know? Then we had a doctor. He came to the house, who was in the same Lager. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What do you mean the house? Didn't-- 

DORA RESCH: In the house. Like I said, in the house. Excuse my English. The house were we was in-- in-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: Was it more than one family in this house? 

DORA RESCH: Sure. It was a house. It was in a-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: Like a barracks? 

DORA RESCH: --in the barn-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: A barn. 

DORA RESCH: --where we was. And the doctor said, he's gonna get well because he's very, uh-- you know, he's not like he just thinking, thinking. 

DORI LAUB: He's active. 

DORA RESCH: Active. 

SALO RESCH: He's like [INAUDIBLE]. 

DORA RESCH: He said, so he's gonna get well. And I went out, and I worked all day. And the potatoes what I got, I give to this doctor. 

We didn't-- we said when God is gonna be good to us, if we are gonna ever survive, we are gonna pay him. We didn't have no money to pay him. He was one of this suffering too. 

So we give him the potatoes, what I worked all day, just he should come and help our brother. He came, and he said, what can he do? The only thing he can say, he's gonna get better because he's not thinking. You see like some-- 

SALO RESCH: Some [INAUDIBLE]. 

DORA RESCH: Maybe my expression is not correct. Because he's very-- like rev-- revulsion, you know? He's very active. He's gonna get better. And it came to a point he was better. Yes, when back, he was better. 

DORI LAUB: Hmm. 

DORA RESCH: The only thing he didn't touch was my mother. My brother-- my oldest brother he ripped off his whole lip. He was crazy, OK? He went crazy. 

DORI LAUB: With-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did many people go crazy? Did many people become disoriented? 

DORA RESCH: Yes, a lot. My own brother-- you-- he's here now, you know. And he has a memory that's incredible, you know. 

He has a memory. He remembers things. It's unbelievable. But he is-- you s-- I'm very nervous, but I-- I'm OK. You know-- 

DORI LAUB: Let-- let-- let's-- your-- go back to the ghetto in Czernowitz. And you also came-- 

SALO RESCH: Yeah. 

DORI LAUB: --to Bershad later. 

SALO RESCH: Well, yeah. So-- 

DORA RESCH: [SIGHS] 

SALO RESCH: --they made transports by railroad. So we went already-- I was at that time with my uncle, and he remained-- I don't know. In Mogilev, it was, uh, there. They said in-- 

DORI LAUB: What-- what was the transport like? 

SALO RESCH: It was in, uh, uh-- it's, uh, the railroad-- the-- the wagons was like what you are using for-- to-- and for transport, not, uh, for people. Those are used to-- 

DORI LAUB: Cattle cars. 

SALO RESCH: Well, the ca-- cattle-- cargo, to use to put merchandise, like, let's say, lumber or whatever you use to put in this type of-- of wagons. They used to put 50, 60 people in a wagon, and that's how it was. That's-- 

DORI LAUB: And how long did it take to get-- 

SALO RESCH: Oh, several days, a week sometimes from there. Sometimes it tooked you more than a week to transport them. 

DORI LAUB: Any-- any f-- any food, any-- 

SALO RESCH: No. No, if you managed to get to sneak by to work for somewhere or to-- to take a jacket and to exchange for a little bit of, uh, cornmeal, or a-- a couple of potatoes, or whatever it is, otherwise, you didn't have nothing what to eat. Then-- 

DORI LAUB: What-- how did you get water? What-- how did you-- 

SALO RESCH: Water was just-- 

DORI LAUB: Toilets-- 

SALO RESCH: --when you had a chance to get out, to work for somebody, you-- 

DORI LAUB: No, I'm talking of the train ride. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Was it a train? 

SALO RESCH: No water. 

LAUREL VLOCK: A train or a truck? 

SALO RESCH: That was a train. 

DORI LAUB: Train. 

LAUREL VLOCK: It was a train. 

SALO RESCH: A train-- a whole train, that, let's say, had 15 or 20 wagons, and every wagon was like, uh, 40, 50 people. It's all depended how crowded they could be. 

LAUREL VLOCK: And you had no toilets and no-- 

SALO RESCH: No. 

LAUREL VLOCK: --water. 

SALO RESCH: No, nothing. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What did you do? How did you ha-- uh, manage? 

SALO RESCH: You-- you-- you did what you could do. Some people, let's say-- uh, I don't know if you heard about that train who was transporting-- I don't know how many thousands of people was there in that train-- 

DORI LAUB: Now, what-- 

SALO RESCH: --from Iasi to Podu Iloaei. There was-- th-- that train was traveling back and forth a short distance. I don't know. M-- let's say, from Podu Iloaei, that was maybe 30-- 30 miles or maybe less. I don't know. 

But between every station, they used to open the doors, and just they would-- people used to be-- to suff-- suffocate. There were so many people in that wagon that they couldn't resist. And every time they opened just to throw out the dead people. 

DORI LAUB: What was on your train? What do you remember of your trip? 

SALO RESCH: [SIGHS] What I remember, we used to-- we-- we came-- let's say, f-- it took several hours. Who could manage to [INAUDIBLE], most people where they was physically not that strong, they survived. But who was big people or, uh, people what they was-- they used to-- they used to eat a lot and drink all, they couldn't survive. They-- they-- they passed away. Every transport, you had from every wagon, let's say in a day, five, six, maybe 10 people what they passed away there. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What do you remember about what you thought, uh, when you were on the train? 

SALO RESCH: Not-- you didn't even thinked what will be. You tried to surv-- you tried to-- to do your best to-- to survive. You didn't even think that you'll survive. 

DORI LAUB: Oh, and how did you cross the river? You came-- 

SALO RESCH: Uh, we went by train. The-- 

DORI LAUB: Over the river? 

SALO RESCH: Over the river. We went by train. Came through Mogilev, and then part of people remained in Mogilev. They was used to work there. 

Some, uh, groups was taken to work on, uh-- to repair highways. L-- Highways. It's not like highways here. There was multi-ways. They had to-- to repair somehow. That's because during the day, the, uh, army used to march. They n-- they needed-- there was holes and whatever it was. 

You used to carry by hand stones and to fill it out or fill the holes up. And after a days of work, you got a piece of bread, and a-- and sometimes you got a tea or a little bit of water. That's how you survived. 

DORI LAUB: And what happened to you, i-- from-- in Mogilev? From Mogilev? 

SALO RESCH: No, I was taken with a group working on, uh, repairing highways until I came to Bershad. And in Bershad, they said-- 

DORI LAUB: How did you get to Bershad? 

SALO RESCH: By marching day by day. 

DORI LAUB: How many days was it from Mogilev? 

SALO RESCH: Uh, let's see. It was-- for instance, we work-- we worked a-- we-- we marched a day. We worked at a place for like several days. Then we marched further. So it took maybe four or five weeks, um, maybe more, until we came there. And from there-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: There were no-- you were only men, only boys? 

SALO RESCH: There was a lot of young-- mostly young men-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: Young men 

SALO RESCH: --that was taken to work this type of work. 

LAUREL VLOCK: You had no roof over your head, no place to sleep? 

SALO RESCH: No. No, we was, uh-- it was summertime. We were sleeping on the fields. 

LAUREL VLOCK: You had no change of clothing. 

SALO RESCH: No, no, because-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: How did you-- 

SALO RESCH: --you-- you couldn't carry with you the clothes. 

LAUREL VLOCK: How did you keep yourself at all clean or wash? 

SALO RESCH: Whatever you could. Whenever you-- you had a chance to have a little bit of water-- mostly when you had a possibility, there was-- on the sides of the streets, there was rain water, from rain. You-- sometimes the water was, uh, covered with a span like green, you know. 

You shoved this a little bit away. You didn't-- you closed your nose not to feel the smell of the bad smell of water. You sipped a little bit of water. You washed yourself a little bit. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did people get diseased from it? 

SALO RESCH: Oh, yeah. I, for instance, uh, why did I lost my hair? Got sick. I had malaria. 

LAUREL VLOCK: When you were sick, did people leave you alone? Did they help you? What happened? 

SALO RESCH: Whatever help you could get, that was between the people. There was some of there was doctors, Jewish doctors. Whatever they could help you-- uh, you didn't had much medicine to be helped. 

LAUREL VLOCK: Did they have no medicine at all? 

SALO RESCH: But whatever-- but-- but ever-- whatever they could do-- there was sometimes you could, uh, get from a peasant somewhere a little bit of alcohol that should strengthen yourself a little bit. This prevented a little bit of diseases too. 

But a lot of people-- I can say 90% of people passed away in the first year because of undernourishment, not having food, being exposed to diseases, mostly typhoid, bauch typhus. They are saying in German, bauch typhus. That was the main killer of the people. Can say 90% of the people passed away because of disease and mal-- and from hunger. 

DORI LAUB: And who was guarding you? 

SALO RESCH: You was confined to-- even in Bershad, that was a ghetto-type. 

DORI LAUB: Yeah, what is Bershad? Can you describe Bershad? 

SALO RESCH: Bershad is near the Bug, you know. It's in the Ukraine. The Bug. That was before the Bug. On this side of the Bug is Bershad. 

On the other side of the Bug, that was still, uh-- the terr-- this territory was administered by the Romanian pe-- Romanians administered. So more or less, the Romanians gave you a little bit of possibility to-- to survive. Over the Bug, whenever you came over the Bug, as far as I remember-- 

LAUREL VLOCK: Over the-- wha-- over the-- 

DORI LAUB: Bug. 

DORA RESCH: The Bug. 

SALO RESCH: The River Bug, a river. 

LAUREL VLOCK: That was the name. 

SALO RESCH: Bug. That was the name of that river. I remember later on I was told that in 1942, there was-- in Czernowitz, there was-- if I am not mistaken, there was three transports made. There was roughly between 5,000 and 6,000 people taken at, uh, s-- be-- big Jewish soccer field, the Maccabi-Platz. And from there, there was made three transports, roughly between, uh-- a-- around 2,000 people. They went directly into the German-administered parts over the Bug, and most of them, they was rough-- plainly exterminated. 

LAUREL VLOCK: How? 

SALO RESCH: I don't know how because I wasn't there, but that's what I hear. That was the extermination place, because, uh, the Germans didn't treat us like the Romanians. The Romanians-- 

DORA RESCH: They was more lenient to us. 

SALO RESCH: It was roughly around six-- I don't know exactly the people, but-- but that's what I was told. That was around-- 

DORI LAUB: What is Bershad? 

SALO RESCH: Bershad is a town. 

DORI LAUB: Can you describe it? You walked in. What did you see? 

SALO RESCH: Uh, we lived in a-- 

DORI LAUB: What did you see when you came into Bershad? 

SALO RESCH: Ukrainian, uh-- 

DORI LAUB: What kind of-- 

SALO RESCH: --peasants. Ukrainian peas-- peasants. 

LAUREL VLOCK: It was a t-- 

SALO RESCH: Mostly villagers. A-- it's a village. 

LAUREL VLOCK: And where were you staying? Where did they keep you? 

SALO RESCH: There-- there was certain houses where it was a ghetto made. There were certain houses where you was quartered. 

DORA RESCH: The second-- the third-- the third year, he was leaner, like I mentioned to you. There was one who was the whole-- like, he had the-- the [NON-ENGLISH]. He-- not-- how-- what was the [NON-ENGLISH]? The r-- 

SALO RESCH: Ah, the-- 

DORI LAUB: Primar. 

SALO RESCH: The-- 

DORA RESCH: The Primar. 

SALO RESCH: --Primar. The Primar. 

DORA RESCH: Is this correct? The Primar. He was really a angel-- 

SALO RESCH: He's a-- 

DORA RESCH: --because he said to us-- he give us a lot of-- he said, you're in a ghetto, but you have-- I can do nothing for you. You have to help yourself. And that's mean go out from the ghetto and try to help yourself. 

SALO RESCH: The-- the-- the ghettos was, uh, like, made, uh-- surrounded wires. You know the Stacheldraht? 

DORI LAUB: Barbed wire. 

SALO RESCH: Barbed wires. 

DORA RESCH: Right. 

SALO RESCH: So if you had the guts to open up that-- 

DORA RESCH: And go out. 

SALO RESCH: --guard of wires and get out, take a-- a suit or a jacket and sneak in into the village, to the peasants, to exchange for some potatoes or for a little bit of cornmeal to be able to make a little bit of cornmeal soup-- so that's-- that's how you survived. 

DORI LAUB: Were the, uh, guards-- were they, uh, around, the-- the soldiers? 

DORA RESCH: They-- they wasn't. 

SALO RESCH: They was, uh, not that many guards. 

DORA RESCH: They wasn't. 

SALO RESCH: There was guards around, but if you-- you-- 

DORA RESCH: You could. 

SALO RESCH: You s-- you was watching them. It's like you're watching. You know that he has a certain distance to go. 

DORI LAUB: Mm-hmm. 

SALO RESCH: And then whenever you knew that he went that way, you-- you was not alone. There was usually two or three people. One of them-- let's say, for instance, today, I went out. Next day, another one. And so how we tried to manage to get something to survive. 

DORI LAUB: Uh, did you-- there were local Jews in Bershad? 

DORA RESCH: Yes, there was. There was. They helped a lot. 

DORI LAUB: And they were living in the ghetto too with you? 

DORA RESCH: They was, but it-- they wasn't like-- they wasn't in a ghetto. They helped us a lot. They helped a lot. A lot have God in-- in their heart, and they took in-- in children. 

DORI LAUB: Hmm. 

DORA RESCH: And they helped a lot. Oh, yes. You see, like, we was from the first group. Like, the other people came after they send them from, uh, Czernowitz. So they came with good suits, you know. 

I was like a Draufganger. What you say this? Like, you go over dead people. That's how I was, you know. 

So I took from you this suit. I know what I'm gonna get punished, but I didn't ha-- I didn't ca-- I didn't have what lose. Put this way. 

So I took from you a suit. I take a brand-new suit and go and bring for this brand-new suit a piece of bread-- a whole bread, OK? I give this to the Ukrainian who was living there. So when I bring you a whole bread for your suit, you give me a slice of bread too. 

90 times I went through, and the 10 times when they caught me, I paid already for this 90 times where they didn't. They beat you to death, but you didn't have what to lose. So I steep-- I still keep on doing the same thing. 

SALO RESCH: In order to survive, you tried to do what you could do. 

DORI LAUB: The-- I-- again, was there any Jewish organization or a Kultur... a-- 

DORA RESCH: There-- 

SALO RESCH: No. 

DORA RESCH: --no. 

SALO RESCH: No, no, no. 

DORA RESCH: No. 

LAUREL VLOCK: What did it-- how did people react, people who lived civilized, cultured lives, when on this march, they had to-- they lost all their privacy? 

SALO RESCH: [INAUDIBLE] 

LAUREL VLOCK: They lost all-- you know-- 

DORA RESCH: Excuse me. Maybe I shouldn't express myself, but you asked some-- you know, you're a human being, and you have to use the bathroom. What bathroom? You just under the sun. 

SALO RESCH: There are-- no, there are no closet. [INAUDIBLE] 

DORA RESCH: What corner? What corner? The-- you didn't have no corner. I-- what corner? No corner. Right there where you go, OK? No corner. 

LAUREL VLOCK: How did that make people feel? How did they react? 

DORA RESCH: You become like a animal. You know what? You become a animal. That's what you became. 

SALO RESCH: It, uh, hardens you in a-- in a manner that you don't care anymore. 

DORA RESCH: You-- you-- you not any more a human being. You not a human being. You act like a animal. 

LAUREL VLOCK: And afterwards? 

DORA RESCH: And afterwards, when it came all the better years-- that mean better years. But you still didn't have-- you didn't have what to change, you understand? You didn't have-- like from this people, what would you do when tomorrow-- you-- you starving right now. So what? 

When people came already with the other transport, they had good clothes. They had things. So you went and give away for a bread-- just for a bread to survive another day. 

SALO RESCH: The lucky time was when you was taken in groups to go working on the-- on the highways. Even if there was hard work-- uh, hard physical work-- some of the, uh, guys couldn't resist. They-- they-- they fell down the first two-- se-- first or second day, physically. But still, in order to get something, to be able to-- to fill a little bit your belly, you was the lucky one when you went out to work. 

DORI LAUB: Who-- was there any kind of internal Jewish organization? 

SALO RESCH: No.
