S.N. asked 3play media, no explicit template exists, but we can take granted that all metaelements are in square brackets, and in upper case.
I am copying here e-mail communication by 3playmedia:

"We don't have a specific list, but I can say the ones we use most frequently are (besides [INAUDIBLE] and [INTERPOSING VOICES]) are:
 
[APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER] (if it's more than one person)
[LAUGHS] (if it's just the speaker or one person)
[CHEERING]
[BOOING]
[COUGHS] (once), [COUGHING] (extended)
[SNEEZES] (once), [SNEEZING] (multiple/extended
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] (or if the language is known, [SPEAKING FRENCH]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MUSIC - ARTIST, "TITLE"] (if the information is known)
 
 
[CRYING]
[SOBBING]
[SCREAMING]
[PHONE RINGING]
 
I could keep going, but the more unusual the sound, the more it's the editor's discretion.  That being said, for classroom settings, the most typical ones are [APPLAUSE], [LAUGHTER], and [MUSIC PLAYING].  And then during the winter, there are more coughs/sneezes that interrupt classes.
